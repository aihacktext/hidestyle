472520	11423174	384537	1.0	where the hell am i ?	this movie had two things going for it . the beginning credits was one . can you guess the other ? if you said : the end credits , you win . your prize : the best advice you'll ever receive . wait for it - - avoid this movie . this thing just went on and on and on - - and on . i still don't ' have any clue what the hell its about , and i'm damn sure not risking the loss of another two hours of my life on the slim chance i can figure it out . i feel like i spent two hours in a black hole , and it just sucked me in more and more each second . i'm still not sure how i managed to escape its pull , but i'm glad to back on planet earth . truthfully , my friend and i only kept watching because we thought the end would make it somewhat worthwhile . however , we quit watching before the end , because it just took too long to get there . if you must watch this movie , your best bet would be to get really drunk or stoned , and then it might make some sense . i'm kidding of course . or am i . . . ? oh . yeah , in case you were wondering , i didn't like this movie . o
472893	11423174	288477	1.0	beyond pointless ( a true crap fest in every way )	this movie bit the big one , and i mean that in the worst possible way . it starts off really slow and boring . then , they decide to give us a sequence containing buckets of gore , with people dying horrible deaths . bad enough , but . . . the method in which they are dispatched ( pretty much all at the same time ) a mass killing if you will , is beyond the realm of plausibility even for a movie . add to that , the lack of realism in the scene i . e poor makeup effects , with really fake looking blood . what's next ? well , back to being slooooww and borrrring again and bad acting , in fact almost no effort put forth . oh , and really bad dialogue to boot . things did not improve from this point , so i quit watching before the end . i almost felt sorry for the actors , but not quite . they at least picked up a paycheck ( hopefully not too large of one ) from this mess , while the viewer merely loses a good chunk of their life . Julianna Margulies ( a talented actress ) is wasted in this movie , as is Gabrriel Byrne . summing up , we start off with a real yawner , followed by a gore / crap fest . ( ie bad makeup effects , fake looking blood ) next we have another yawn fest , with cheese ( The dialogue hehe ) and , finally a clinic on bad acting . all this for the price of admission or rental to one movie . very impressive . and that's having only seen maybe half the movie . wow . less than
473566	11423174	120458	1.0	had potential , until after the beginning credits rolled	wow , what a mess . bad acting , bad special effects , dumb plot . this one has it all . Donald Sutherland in particular should be ashamed for having the worst fake accent ever . none of the actors seemed to want to be there . maybe they all owed a debt to somebody , and this was the only way to pay it . this thing was a really dog through and through . who green lights this crap ? don't they screen movies before releasing them . i can't believe i sat through this cesspool . i guess i was hoping it might improve . there's 90 minutes of my life i'll never get back , and neither will you if you subject yourself to this so called movie . watch this movie at your own peril . so , if you like a movie with good acting , good special effects and a good plot-look elsewhere , i beg you . , though it deserves much less
472660	11423174	439815	1.0	if you miss one movie this decade-it should be " Slither "	can you smell that ? it's the stench from this so called movie . i realize that this movie is supposed to be a horror comedy . however , it is missing two important elements . horror and comedy . i cannot believe any actor could be convinced by any agent to appear in this bomb . they should all fire their agents . i never once laughed during this movie , nor was i even remotely scared . i was scared however , that if i didn't get the disc out of my player , the thing would spread and fry my player's circuits . then it might spread throughout my house infecting everything in its path . from there it would spread outside and eventually take over the world . thankfully , i removed the menace from my DVD player in time . otherwise i don't think i could have handled the guilt involved with inflicting such a dreadful disease on the unsuspecting public . truly a waste of celluloid . i'd say Slither was a " z " movie , but that is giving it higher praise . it may have aspired to such lofty heights , but it fails miserably in that ( or any ) regard . much less than out of 10
473813	11423174	433386	1.0	pretty much as dreadful as the first one	i was hoping this movie would be better than the first one , which i thought was dreadful . overall , i think it is a bit better , but not very much . the only thing better about it is it has slightly more eerie and creepy , vibe , but just slightly . however , other than that , this movie is dreadfully boring and not really scary at all . it's also annoying at times . i also never really connected with the characters , so it was kind of hard to care about their fates . there are also a few things that don't quite make sense . there a few illogical moments , even in the context of this movie . i don't know if there will be a Grudge 3 or not , but it wouldn't bother me if they never made another one . i gave the first Grudge 1 star and overall , this one isn't really any better . as a result , i give " The Grudge 2 "
473126	11423174	104997	1.0	AKA Night Caller ( 1992 ) don't bother answering this call	i don't know what they were thinking . by they , i mean anybody even remotely connected to this disaster . i've seen so bad movies , i've seen so really bad movies , and then there's this . but i will say one thing . whoever wrote the script has manged to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over written , onto the screen . there is nothing good about this movie , either from a technical standpoint or any other standpoint . whoever allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately . there are a few fairly well known names in this movie . actually i hesitate to use the word movie . it's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense . anyway , i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this . i got it really cheap , and i still got ripped of . even if i had gotten this movie for free , i would still have been ripped off . this is an absoluter
473715	11423174	83530	1.0	more tedious than the first one , and that's saying something	somehow , i managed to get through all 84 minutes of airplane 2 . however , i found it more tedious than airplane 1 , which i thought was impossible . i think i cracked a smile once during the first one , but not even close in this one . the jokes were even more stale and unfunny . i'm sure there are people who have enjoyed and will enjoy this movie , but i am not one of those people . interestingly , ken finkleman wrote and directed this movie and would years later go on to create and write the very funny show the newsroom . but i digress . after watching airplane 2 , i decided i have to do something fun and entertaining . so ' i'voe booked myself into a four day insurance seminar . maybe i'll get more laughs out of it . unless you're a hardcore fan you should avoid this movie . out of 10
473302	11423174	85636	1.0	awful stand alone movie ( and i mean awful )	on this suckiness scale , this movie ranks right up there . it's a stand alone movie that has nothing to do with the rest of the Halloween series . i didn't like much about this movie . i actually felt dirty after watching it . thankfully , it's not all that memorable . but i remember all i need to about it . it sucked . myself , i didn't see that point . i know without a doubt that i will never view this movie again . there are only a handful of movies i can say that about ( so far , any way ) . i'm not sure of the exact running time . it's somewhere between 96 and 99 minutes . coincidently , its also between 96 and 99 minutes too long . this is just my opinion , of course , and some people will disagree with it . the only thing i can suggest is , after watching it for awhile , and you find it's not very good , turn it off . it doesn't get better . for me , Halloween III : Season of the Witch is an abysmal
472859	11423174	367153	1.0	unbelievably sick and awful ( in the worst way )	what a horrible , horrible movie . i thought i was watching a snuff film . you have to be emotionally unhinged to enjoy this piece of excrement . low budget and it shows . the camera lingers for a very long time on all the killing scenes , way too long . the acting is poor , the plot is ridiculous and full of inconsistencies and holes you could drive a couple of semi trucks through . but really the movie is just pointless , gratuitous gore and violence . this dog may be worse than hostel . it's definitely a close race . if you're even slightly well adjusted , you will have no use for this bomb . if you do enjoy this film , i hope i never live next door to you . i felt so dirty after watching this thing , i had to take a shower right after to cleanse myself . and i may never get the stench out of my house . truly , truly , sick and demented ( and not in any good way ) filth
472901	11423174	89629	1.0	this movie is a violation ( but my cactus liked it )	i should have known what i was getting myself into as soon as i realized some of the same people behind Police Academy , were responsible for this thing . but , i thought i'd give it a shot . turns out , all copies of this movie should be shot into outer space , where it can do no harm , at least to us earthlings . i guess if i was 12 . this movie might be funny , but i doubt it . the movie ( and i use this term loosely ) is basically about a bunch of odd characters who get sentenced to traffic school in order to get their licenses back . this movie is really bad , alright , but , believe it or not , there are much worse movies , which should also join this thing on its outer space voyage . it is awful , but there are varying degrees of awful . on the awful meter this thing ranks somewhere almost near the middle . i think my cactus liked it . i'm sure i heard it laugh a few times . as for my fellow human beings , however , if you are looking for a comedy-keep looking . a very weak
473236	11423174	312528	1.0	not suitable for kids or adults , not suitable for any age group .	this movie is pretty bad . i haven't been this bored in a long time . Alec Baldwin must have been into the sauce when he agreed to do this thing . it's marketed as a kid's movie with a PG rating , but this really isn't a kid's movie . there is some very adult language implied . yet it is not a movie for adults either , because it is so juvenile . so , really this movie is not suitable for anyone . By the way , Mike Meyers looks like a complete idiot as the cat . this movie doesn't strike me as being very faithful to the spirit of the children's book by Dr . Seuss . the only other thing i can say about this movie is it is colourful . otherwise , there is no good reason for anyone to watch this movie . a weak
472664	11423174	95444	1.0	an absolutely dreadful excuse for comedy	lame-o . i think this bomb was supposed to be a comedy . but that assumes laughter would be involved , and you know what they say when you assume . bottom line , not funny , not even mildly amusing . it is however , stupid . but it isn't a total loss . i mean , after this experience , i now have a new appreciation for the route canal . honestly , if you're 3 years old and under , i suppose you may find something funny in this thing , but i doubt it . of course if you're 3 years old , the clowns may be a bit too scary for you . so , really that leaves nobody who should find this bore fest funny . if you're really that bored , paint something and watch the paint dry . you get just as many laughs out of it . save yourself-just avoid this turkey at all costs .
472897	11423174	97527	1.0	outdoes the previous " House " ( more often known as " The horror show " ) entry in sheer crappiness	so , on we go to round three of the " House " series . we ( my sister and i ) had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed , to say the least . the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further . how bad could number 3 be ? it starts off promising enough . after all , it had Lance Henricksen ( he should've passed ) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget . however , it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud . another ridiculous plot , bad acting , bad everything . i think this one made it 40 minutes tops . any longer and my head would have exploded . again , no horror , and no comedy . i must be missing something . i wish i knew what it was . this thing gets a low note : this movie is sometimes referred to as " House 3 " including the copy i have . SO , although it may have little or nothing to do with the " House " other than name , i chose to refer to it as " House " 3 in my summary . i hope this clears up any confusion .
472524	11423174	290747	1.0	a true z movie if there ever was one	wooo-eeee . does this movie suck . i'd say it was a b movie , but it's more like a z movie . from the 30 minutes i was able to suffer through , this is a typical teen slasher movie , except that some crazed swamp monster is doing the killing . almost right off the bat , you have the requisite sex scene between two teenagers . there is some nudity in this scene , which would have been great , except the rest of the movie had to come along and ruin it . and of course one of them gets killed in a particularly grisly way . the characters have less depth than one dimensional cardboard cutouts . but at least this movie is consistent . the music is also of the z quality , completely lame and forgettable . for some strange reason , Matthew Le Nevez , who plays the town's new sheriff , Kyle Williams and presumably , a main character , tries to play his role as if he were in an Oscar calibre movie . this movie isn't even razzie calibre . i wanted to keep watching until it showed the creature , so i could bash the makeup and creature effects as it would only have been fair . alas , i just couldn't take the torture any longer and had to quit watching . i give this stinker a low
473129	11423174	357413	1.0	i'd rather have my sinuses scraped	This movie is pathetic . every drama i've ever seen is funnier than this " alleged " " comedy . even the anti piracy warning before the movie , is funnier . i'd give an overview of the plot , but it's just too painful . right after the movie , i booked myself for a sinus scraping , followed directly after by a 4 day insurance seminar . i had an ear to ear grin through both the scraping and the insurance seminar . they were both much more entertaining than Anchorman . i know some people thought this movie was funny , but i can't help but wonder if they were either paid , or were somehow involved with the making of the movie . there's no other rational explanation . i didn't find the movie offensive in any way , it was just horribly , depressingly boring . maybe if i had gouged out my eyeballs while watching it , i would have been more entertained . if you like your comedies with no comedy involved , this one's for you . otherwise , try Harold and Kumar go to White Castle , or Repli-Kate , two insanely hysterical comedies . there is no rating low enough for this dreck .
472616	11423174	105322	1.0	i feel violated ,	in the worst possible way . this movie is worse than the second one . not only is the acting bad , but it was over the top , and not in a good way . this movies tries too take itself seriously and be something it isn't , which is a good movie . this thing is absolutely ridiculous , with a plot that is not only bizarre , but is truly not from this planet , or probably any other . there's no believability here at all . but in all fairness , this movie is at least as loud as the last one , so i guess that's something . not something good , but something . the whole premise of Scanners is not believable by any stretch , but in this mess , the unbelievability factor is way past the stratosphere . in case i'm not being clear , i didn't like it .
472865	11423174	80850	1.0	help ! ! ! i've just lost 93 minutes of my life ! ! !	what a drag this movie was . it is bad even by most horror movie standards . i kept waiting for something scary to happen . when the end credits finally rolled , realized i was not going to get my wish . there'e nothing scary about this movie , except for the acting and the dialogue and the script . in that case it was truly terrifying . this is your standard cookie cutter horror movie , except not as good . the guy playing the villain is not at all convincing . the characters are just as stupid as in most horror movies , so after a while you wait for them to be killed , just to get it over with . the plot is not logical , and there is at least one glaring technical problem with the movie , which is the following : there is a scene between a female student and her professor in bed at night . the power goes out and plunges the room into darkness . the prof goes downstairs to check it out . in the next scene we see the girl in bed as bright as day . so , what happened to the power outage ? i admit , i had my eyes shut for this movie alright , because i found it hard to keep awake . this movie is a really stinker and wasn't even bad in a good way , it was just plain bad . even the brief scene of nudity can't excuse this mess . oh yeah , tom hanks makes a very small appearance in his movie debut , as elliot , a psyche student . good thing it was a small role , or this thing could have torpedoed his career before it got started . this one gets a well deseved out of 10 yuuck
472942	11423174	449086	1.0	2 hours gone forever into the abyss ( which is where this movie belongs )	sometimes you go into a film with very low expectations , and occasionally you are pleasantly surprised . Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist is not that movie . i was sure this movie would be a piece of crap , except that i would rather have watched a piece of crap for 2 hours . it would have been much more entertaining . so why did i watch it ? well , it was on cable , i had nothing better to do , and i like to give every movie the benefit of the doubt . but the most important reason i sat through this thing : i ran out of pins to stick in my eyes . there is very little good about this film , other than the end credits . Stellan Skarsgard is a very talented actor , but his talents are wasted on this dud . you expect to see a movie with a demon , based on the title . the demon only appears well after half of the movie has elapsed , and it does not inspire fear at all , but is laughable . the movie is also disjointed and has many scenes that have no relevance . then again the movie has no relevance either . it does at times become a sermon , which is very annoying . special mention must go to the people in charge of the cgi effects . they have managed to creature the worst cgi animals i have ever seen . hyenas , several cattle and even a snake were very obviously all cgi . completely fake looking . unless you want to lose 2 hours of your life , don't even go near this thing . a well deserved
473157	11423174	93777	1.0	really bad Carpenter film	Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter . the whole thing is ridiculous . take the premise , for example . A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself , or rather his son . said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church . upon discovering it , said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it . soon , the liquid ends up in most of the students ( don't ask ) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son ( said liquid ) into freeing daddy aka Satan . Anyway , the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi / fantasy / horror . there just isn't any point . Carpenter really misses the mark here . With all due respect to the late , great Donald Pleasence , what was he thinking ? the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is ( marginally ) less awful than " Slither " and " Lawnmower Man 2 " .
472896	11423174	104449	1.0	final and worst installment of the " House " series ( i'm not joking )	how low can you go ? not much lower than this , the 4th and final ( hopefully ) installment int the dreadfully awful " House " series . each previous entry outdid the last for sheer crap . the last installment , made it about 30 minutes , when we realized we couldn't go any further . we never laughed once , nor jumped out of our seats once . these movies are billed as horror / comedy , so shouldn't they contain elements of horror and comedy ? the fact this series was ever released onto an unsuspecting public is horrifying indeed . i don't know if i've ever been this bored in my entire life . i mean , what the hell were these people ( anyone involved in this crap fest ) smoking ? some movies are so bad , they'r good . i wish this movie was that good . after torturing ourselves for way too long , we went outside and watched the grass grow to relieve the boredom .
472757	11423174	392878	1.0	the opposite of good	i enjoy a good , clever satire as much as anyone . unfortunately this is neither . it is however , sick and offensive and i'm not someone who gets easily offended . it's basically a bunch of mostly unrelated short skits that don't just cross the line . rather , this " movie " actually creates several new lines and crosses them all . i didn't find it funny at all . in fact , i'm surprised it even got past the censors . it's not that its politically incorrect and i'm no slave to political correctness . that can be all right sometimes , if done properly . no , this goes way beyond any definition of political incorrectness i've ever known . it's beyond mean spirited . i mean i guess it skewers some targets that deserve to be skewered , but mostly it demeans people and groups that don't deserve it , certainly not to the degree shown here . it's just cruel . but hey , at least now we have a new word for something sick and cruel that it defies description . that word is " Onion " . for me , the Onion Movie is pure " Onion " .
473504	11423174	107415	1.0	sinks faster than the " Titanic "	i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago . what a disaster . the acting was atrocious . there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon . this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring true . supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original " Lifeboat " . i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it . from what i was able to suffer through , there is nothing compelling in this movie . it boasts a few semi big names , but they put no effort into their characters . but , you know , to be fair , it was nobody's fault really . i mean , i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion . LOL . it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along . but for me , i'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out . so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon , avoid this stinker /
472608	11423174	96118	1.0	check out Anchor Bay's uncut version instead	this movie is not good . the first one almost sucked , but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching . this one has nothing . there's zero scare , zero tension or suspense . this isn't really a horror movie . most of the kills don't show anything . there's no gore to speak of . this could almost be a TV , except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence . the acting is not very good , either . and don't get me started on the dialogue . as for the surprise ending , surprise , there isn't one . i suppose it could have been worse , although i don't see how . but then again , it is less than 80 minutes long , so i guess that's a good thing . although it felt a lot longer . apparently this is the cut version of the film . i found it for a very cheap price , but it still not worth it . if you want the uncut more graphic version , check out the Anchor Bay edition . anyway , this version of Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers gets a big fat from me . p . s . if you watch this movie , you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper . if you are a real fan , you might want to pick up Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp ( with survival kit ) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
473227	11423174	322651	1.0	quick , over here ! . i think i've found it . . . ,	no . sorry . my mistake . i thought for a minute i may have found the plot to this movie . but i don't think think a search party could have any success finding the plot to this movie . there are a few good actors in this movie , but they can't do anything to make it better . i think the movie dragged their performances down with it . as a a result , you won't find much in the way of acting here . and the dialogue . wow . awful , truly awful . i suspect they were going for something profound here , but they fell short by a long shot . this thing is really tedious . i think this is a case where they should have scrapped this thing before it was done , or at least not released it . i don't want to say it's bad , but it sure is the opposite of good . this is how i feel about the movie , and others may feel differently . all i know is , it sure didn't do it for me . for me , Dream Warrior is a / 10 movie .
473758	11423174	408666	1.0	one of the worst movies ever made	this turd is so bad i wasn't sure i should review it . but , if it keeps one person from seeing it , i'll be happy . i got through 37 minutes and just couldn't take any more . i don't know who comes up with this stuff . are they out on the streets among the rest of us ? i hope not . anyway , this is billed as a vampire movie . there is also a couple of lesbians , a dysfunctional family , some gang violence , and some really disgusting scenes involving the vampires feeding . but this mess is not coherent at all , the acting ( and i shudder to call it that ) was beyond atrocious . the dialogue , again beyond words in its horribleness . If you have 5 dollars and a half dozen or so friends , congratulations you've just made a better movie . a very weak
472928	11423174	120177	1.0	atrocious	boy , what a letdown this movie was . compared to the animated series , this doesn't even rate . it's all of the place , in terms of tone and story . the acting is pretty bad from all concerned . i felt embarrassed for everybody involved . i found the story lacking in any real excitement . plus , for this character , there should have been a much more compelling characterization . i know it's an origin story , but i think they could have done a lot more with it . it doesn't make much sense , and i couldn't give a lick about any of the characters . the whole thing is really just nonsense . it's 94 minutes i'll never get back . for me , Spawn is a a dismal
473325	11423174	327162	1.0	awful awful movie that takes its name from the original	how to start . how about abysmal , boring , a complete train wreck ? that barely touches the surface when describing this mess . this movie is dreary , and depressing , to say the least . painfully torturous to watch . but for some reason , i Sat through it all . the big problem was the writing which was pedantic at best . then there is the acting ; sub par from some usually reliable actors . one big problem was that they tried to make it funny . i haven't seen the original yet , but i do know it was played as a drama , not a comedy . and i'm guessing it works much more effectively . i also suspect the casting decisions were smarter for the original . the actors were clearly miscast for this mess . they did not look comfortable at all . plainly stated , this movie could not have been very faithful to its source material and that is its failing . But in that case it would have been the exact same movie as the original . what i'm really saying is that this movie was not necessary . i'm sure the movie going public wasn't clamoring for it . bottom there are many crappy movies out there to avoid , and this is one of them .
473671	11423174	80487	1.0	you're joking , right ?	i had hear a lot about how great this movie is , over the years . so imagine my shock and disappointment to find out it's pure crap . i didn't find it funny , or amusing , or even entertaining . i swear i never even smiled once . i realise this is just my opinion of course , but i can't get over the high score ( ) this movie has on this site . it boggles the mind . anyway , for whatever reason , i didn't think this was a good movie at all . in fact , it's brutal . there are some big comedy names of the era in this one , so you'd think that would count for something . but it doesn't seem to , at least in my opinion . i'm sure i'm in the minority , but my vote for Caddyshack is a dismal
473760	11423174	100403	1.0	An awful sequel to the original	This movie is about the " predator " again . but this time he is in modern day Los Angelles , where a string of bodies have been discovered . and this time the " Predator can blend into his surroundings again , which just happen to be sky scrapers . gimme a break . first off , this dud does not have Arnie . second it looks like it was made for 5 dollars . the premise is kind of dumb . " Predator " in the jungle i could see , but in Los Angelles . come on . anyway , this is not a worthy sequel to the original . i could not watch it all , because it was so lame . the acting wasn't very good , and there are some good actors here . i think this could have been good movie , if they had spent some money , and thought of a better idea for the story . as it is , this was junk .
473152	11423174	395251	1.0	a complete waste of time and money if you are looking for an actual movie that resembles a theatrical movie in some way	Well , i tried to watch this movie , i really did . but i had to quit watching after 30 minutes . this movie is based on the musical of the same name , and it shows . it plays like a musical all right , but hey forgot the movie . i mean , there is no flow here at all . everything is disjointed . The actors ( Matthew Broderick , Nathan Lane and even the extras ) play their parts as if they are actually in a Broadway musical , and not a theatrical movie that is ( or at least should be ) merely based on a musical Broadway . i mean , what's the point . this production just does not translate into a theatrical motion picture . I realize i only watched 30 minutes , but i don't see the rest of the film being any different . if you like musicals , you will like this " movie " but then again , you could simply go see the exact same thing on stage . only for lovers of the stage . out of 10

473471	11423174	417056	1.0	i can't believe i swallowed the same booger for nearly 30 min .	where to start ? virtually no plot . bad acting , bad taste . lots of t & a . nude lesbian scenes . even that can not salvage this booger . not much else . Paris Hilton is in this . i still say she can act , given the right material , but the road to becoming a serious ( or at least respected ) actress does not begin with this phlegm . or maybe she doesn't want to become a serious actress . in which case , she is headed in the right direction . i may have managed to get through half an hour of this thing , before i said , screw it , there must be something else to do . i am not a prude and have low standards ( or is that high standards ? - - i can never remember ) when it comes to things such as bad taste , but this was beyond my capacity . mostly because it just not relevant . but then neither was the rest of the movie . Most of the actresses in this sludge probably don't have the acting ability to make it in porn movies . anyway , i think i met the required 10 lines , so i'll leave it at that . but don't say i didn't warn you . a big fat
472692	11423174	370032	1.0	muddled and incoherent	talk about a pointless movie . i mean , i love Milla as much as the next guy , but even she can't save this disaster . she looks hot and she's in great shape . she's just in the wrong movie . i could only take so much of her character , V ( Short for Violet ) going up against increasingly overwhelming odds time after time and emerging with barely a scrape . and that's mostly all this movie is , in my mind : a collection of action / fight sequences , with pretty much no coherent plot . i didn't particularly like Either of the first two Resident Evil movies , but this is worse than both of them . i don't mind saying i was bored out of my skull . even the action sequences become boring , once you see the same thing over and over again . talk about a train wreck . this movie really made my head hurt . i'm sorry i lost 94 minutes of my life for this thing . check out Resident Evil : Extinction ( on the big screen ) instead . anyway , for me Ultraviolet is a definite
473018	11423174	88870	1.0	woof !	( The title of this movie translates to Star Knight in English ) man . i'm not sure what i just witnessed . i know there is some comedy , but it isn't the good kind . i think it was intended to be funny , but it fell flat , in my eyes . there is also some bad some bad acting . although to be fair , the dialogue was translated from Spanish to English , so maybe a lot got lost in the translation and the actors had a hard time being in sync with the dubbed dialogue . anyway , Harvey Keitel is in this , but he looks kinda embarrassed . but maybe i'm just imagining it . this is supposed to be a romance , adventure sci-fi , but it sure is boring . i found the plot ridiculous , to put it mildly . my head hurt from watching it . in my opinion , if you wanted to watch this movie , i think your best bet would be to catch it on TV . that way , you won't be out any money . i got this movie really cheap , and i still feel cheated . i think i've gotten the required ten lines of text in , so i'll end by saying that for me , Star Knight is
473711	11423174	81398	1.0	raging bull ? raging bore	wow , what a letdown . i had heard friends and critics say that raging bull was a great movie , even a masterpiece . well , i finally decided to watch it . all i can say is . . . i don't think so . i found the entire movie a complete bore and horribly depressing . the movie may have been based on a true story , and maybe Scorsese was going for reality , but i'm sorry , what a horrible human being Jake Lomatta is . how can anyone remotely sympathize with this wretch . he deserved everything he got . but this is the one time Hollywood should have taken dramatic license and made the character into a semblance of a human being . anyway , the film chronicles the rise and fall of boxer Jake Lomatta played by Robert Deniro . Scorsese filmed the movie in black and white , supposedly for effect , but it was lost on me . a good movie needs a main character you can relate to and / or sympathize with and this movie doesn't have that . there are no redeeming qualities in this movie . i felt like i wanted to kill myself after watching it . simply put this movie is a colossal waste of time . i know many people totally disagree with this view point and i can't for the life of me understand why , but that's life . out of 10
473459	11423174	67116	1.0	another bore fest masquerading as a movie	i must be seeing things . i swear this movie has a rating of 7 . 9 . but that can't be right . that would mean it is actually a good movie . so i guess the 7 . 9 is out of a possible 100 . seriously , The French Connection is one long bore . Gene Hackman is a gifted actor , but even he can't save this mess . William ( i have yet to make a decent film ) Friedkin shows once again how to make any action sequence seem slower than molasses . i know people rave about this guy , but i have to wonder if they just mimic what they may have heard someone else say . i blame the first person who ever saw this movie and described the experience in a positive light . honestly , if i had known what i was in for , i would gladly have hacked off all my limbs and poured salt in the wounds instead . that would have made for a much more pleasurable experience . and just in case you don't know what the movie is about , here's a brief synopsis : cop movie with bad dialogue , punctuated by boring action sequences , followed by more bad dialogue and on and on . the writers should not escape notice for their part in this disaster . Clearly , the script was lost somewhere along the way . Right after the beginning credits rolled . up until that point , it held promise . if you enjoy being bored to tears for an extended length of time , i recommend a double bill-this movie and another bore fest-To Live and Die in L . A .
473500	11423174	74875	1.0	a pointless non horror / non thrilling movie	this is not a good movie . i don't recall seeing worse acting for a long time . basically , a new student becomes bullied to the point where he is pushed over the edge . he exacts revenge by killing those who wronged him , making their deaths look accidental . sounds okay so far , right . but , this killer decides to kill other students who had nothing to do with bullying him . now there are no real " legitimate " reasons given to murder everybody . now , we get to the acting . each time a fellow student has a fatal accident , the other students show very little emotion and continue as if nothing has happened . i have to chalk this up to the limited acting ability of all the actors . in most so called horror movies , acting is not expected to be Oscar calibre , but this is worse than almost any movie in the horror genre . and things are worse because this movie has no scary sequences , so it would be nice if the actors could pick up some of the slack . the characters are like robots in their reactions , so it's really hard to like any of them . there are at least two scenes of nudity which are pointless . there is never any suspense generated , so there is never any feeling of anyone being in jeopardy . one last thing . this movie tries to take itself way too seriously , as if it is an Oscar contender . if it had been played for laughs , it may have been a better , or at least watchable movie .
472780	11423174	478856	1.0	laughable	this is one truly awful - - i hesitate to use the word - - movie . it's very low budget , which isn't always a bad thing . the real problem with this movie is the abysmal acting , which overshadows everything . the story is stupid also . i have seen better high school plays , i kid you not . i didn't make it any where near the end of this movie . it just got to the point where i couldn't take it anymore . i felt sure my head would explode if i watched another microsecond . just because you have a camera and some friends to appear in in front of said camera , doesn't mean you are making a movie . i don't know what this was , but movie doesn't describe it . this is just my opinion , and some people may have fun with how awful it is , but i thought it was beyond that point . this turkey gets a very well deserved
473414	11423174	267679	1.0	truly painful to watch , unless you're into unintentional bad acting	as disaster movies , this is pretty awful . poor acting all around , especially from the woman who played the town mayor . judging by her performance , i'm guessing she thought she was in a comedy . nobody did a good job in their roles , except maybe John Schnieder , who was not too bad and Michelle Greene was okay . as for the rest , there isn't a convincing one in the lot . i was so embarrassed for them all . but to be fair , some of the dialogue they were given is atrocious . not much thought went into this film . 1 positive though is that the lightning scenes were done well , and were almost impressive at times . the story itself moves way too slow , with pointless scene after pointless scene . this movie is not worth your time , unless you want to laugh at bad acting . the movie is supposed to be serious , and is not played for camp value , at all , and that is the real disaster .
473792	11423174	905968	1.0	Ulli Lommel strikes again	( this movie should not be confused with the Brian DePalma film , which i haven't seen , but i am sure it is exponentially better than the travesty i just witnessed ) . yeesh . this movie is vile , and i mean that in the worst possible way . it looks like documentary or a home movie the way it was shot . i felt like i was watching a snuff movie . as a matter of fact , this " movie reminded me of another one , which also made me think i was viewing a snuff film . turns out there's a good reason for this . it seems Ulli Lommel is not only the director behind this p . o . s . but he is also responsible for that other cinematic travesty , B . T . K Killer . next time is see this guy's name near any movie , i gonna run as fast as i can in the opposite direction . of the 50 plus reviewers on this site , most voted this thing a 1 . 4 / or less . there were a few people who loved it . or at least seemed to , and that's fine . everybody ' is entitled to their opinion . but for me , this is just sick . a well deserved
472871	11423174	310837	1.0	please shoot me ! i've lost the will to live	so , in the less than 30 minutes i could stomach of this puke before losing my lunch , i saw more nudity than in most pornos , not to mention worse acting . supposedly the plot is that many van drivers on the highway assist the big rig truckers in avoiding the highway police by creating blockades , or distracting the police ( usually , with a big pair of well placed boobs , for the male cops , anyway ) now , i'm all for showing naked women with big boobs , but when every scene is simply an excuse for a woman to get naked , it just gets stupid . i can imagine the ( so called ) director setting up the scene : " Okay ladies , listen up , this is very complicated , but important so pay attention-take off your clothes ! please don't make me go through it all again " . like i alluded to earlier , the acting was lower quality than any porn movie . for the male parts , i imagine they went through a rigorous selection process before they found the right guys . I think it went something like this : they randomly picked a guy off the street and said " hey , dude , you wanna be in a movie ? , there just might possibly be some naked breasts involved " . man , i bet they had to weed out a lot of hopefuls . as for finding the women , it would have been a similar process something along the lines of : " hey baby , make ya a star " . boy , how rigorous and exhausting that must have been for the film ( and i use that very loosely ) makers . now this is billed as a comedy , and it is indeed a comedy ( for all the wrong reasons ) but you may not know that it is also a horror movie-the horror being that it ever saw the light of day . i actually lost the will to live for awhile after seeing this . truly beyond putrid .
473556	11423174	477071	1.0	morbid , overly depressing , pointless and incoherent	talk about a painful movie to watch . this is it . i found it morbid , overly depressing and pointless , as i mentioned in the summary . usually when things happen in a movie , there is a reason for them . not in his movie . it doesn't make sense and it just sort of ends , with no explanation . i found it wholly unsatisfying . Sandra Bullock demonstrates she is a fine dramatic actress , but i think she picked the wrong movie to display her ability . the trailers made the movie look interesting , and if it actually made some sense and wasn't so incoherent , it might have been . my friend i a both agreed , it was one of the biggest wastes of time for both of us , in a long while . i certainly wouldn't recommend it . for me , this is a one star movie and that might even be too much .
472666	11423174	119707	1.0	a complete mess , with no point . a useless sequel	wow . what a piece of crap . this movie blows . the first Mortal Kombat is no classic , but compared to this movie it is like Shakespeare . this movie has very little merit . there is so much wrong with it , it is hard to know where to begin . first off , the fight scenes are ridiculously over the top and way too protracted . the acting is abysmal , with very few of the original actors returning . in particular , the guy playing Rayden is miscast , to say the least . also , the actors playing the villains are not believable , so there is no sense of jeopardy or urgency to the film . the whole mess plays more like a comedy than a serious movie . the good guys have no depth , so you really don't care what happens to them . I also have to mention the stilted dialogue and the wooden delivery of almost every line . the music was also distracting and grating , especially during the fight scenes . i could not watch this movie all the way trough , because it is so awful . this is a completely incoherent mess . a definitely inferior remake , which should never have been made . at least the original has some heart to it . the sequel has some okay special effects , but not enough to recommend it . which being liberal .
473492	11423174	114151	1.0	dull	wow . i was disappointed in the first Poison Ivy movie , but compared to this movie , it is a masterpiece . this is one long , slow , tedious movie . the plot of the movie ( if you can call it that , is incoherent . i would say it was ant climatic , but there is no climax , and without that , you can't have an anti climatic movie . to me , this movie is basically a soft core porn . i watched the whole movie hoping for some good to come out of it . no such luck . there are a few minutes of action , but not enough to redeem this movie . plus , i thought the dialogue was cringe worthy . i think the movie was just an excuse for people to get naked . anyway , i didn't like it at all . for me Poison Ivy II is a
472543	11423174	488539	1.0	not for all tastes ( lots of very vulgar language )	i didn't like this movie at all . i think it's supposed to be a parody of March of the Penguins . but for me , it just wasn't funny . plus , i felt the humour consisted of mostly vulgar , crude language . there's a lot of the F-bomb ( among other words ) dropped here . this definitely isn't for kids . but i also just found it boring . i actually couldn't watch it all , because i found it too slow . as for the crude language , that doesn't always bother me , but i just found it gratuitous and too frequent . i don't think you always need to have swears to make things funny . it's not for every taste , that's for sure . if you don't mind a lot of very crude language , you might want to check this one out . for me , Farce of the Penguins is a
473260	11423174	157503	1.0	most offensive , unfunny movie i have ever seen	bad , bad , bad . there have only been a handful of movies i have walked out of before the end . this is one of them . i think my buddy & i made it to the halfway point , before saying , " screw it , let's leave " . not only was the movie not funny , but it really stereotyped a certain population more frequently and strongly than any day time trash talk show would . i don't belong to the particular group they are targeting , but i was actually offend . i mean , this is one bitter , mean spirited movie . and i never get offended , at least not to that degree . . i won't name any of the actors , to spare them shame , if they have any . i just didn't see the point . i'm guessing some of the actors involved belonged in one of three categories . 1 : they needed the money desperately . 2 : they owed someone a huge favour . 3 : they didn't read the script , for whatever reason . anyway , i can't see anyone liking this movie , but judging from the rating ( ) some people did . all i know is i didn't . in fact , this is one of the top five worst movies i have ever seen . even though this is pushing it , i'll grudgingly give " Drop Dead Gorgeous " a
472924	11423174	344864	1.0	just enjoy the first one , this one has no excuse for its existence ( other than dollar signs ) shame on you , Disney	i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequel ( but not really a sequel ) to " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " but this would be a very short comment . the magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found here . the animation is pretty poor all over , the characters themselves are not very well drawn . the backgrounds and the foregrounds are also not good . there's very little attention to detail here . and instead of a compelling and engaging story , we have 3 short stories which are boring and don't make a lot of sense . i swear , even the characters sounded like they were bored , and would rather be somewhere else . which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be someplace else , at least that's the impression . some of the same actors return for this dismal effort , but an integral par of the success of the first one was Michael J . Fox as the main hero , Milo Thatch . i get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first one , without much thought or care . but at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of " Kida " . that's probably the only good thing about this movie , and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it . mind you , i guess you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving their all , considering what they had to work with . or rather not work with . this is a straight to video movie ( and i use the term loosely ) which should have went straight to the nearest landfill . anyway , shame on Disney . consumers deserve much better than this . this one gets a and a well deserved one at that . p . u

472528	11423174	80339	2.0	does not stand the test of time	wow . what a bore . the jokes were tired and lame . my friend and i barely chuckled . we had to stop it just after an hour . we just couldn't go on . i remember this movie being funny , the last time i watched it . but that was over twenty years ago . it is true , the movie is old and obviously dated , but i was hoping for a few laughs . i felt like going outside and watching the grass grow , just to relieve the boredom . all i can say is , this movie might be funny if you are seeing for the first time , but i doubt it . you should have a backup plan , like sticking pins in your eyes . you'll be a lot more entertained . this is one truly dreadful movie , i guess maybe because audiences are more sophisticated today , and the humour is much simpler in this movie than it is today . a very low just based on its age
472860	11423174	337921	2.0	great premise , bad movie	cellular is an example of a movie with a good premise , which has potential , but falls flat . the basic premise is : a school teacher is kidnapped by a bunch of thugs and locked in a room . somehow , she manages to build a make shift phone and calls a random phone number for help . the person she calls happens to be on a cell phone . at first he thinks it's a joke . when she finally convinces him she is truly kidnapped , he must try to find her before it's too late . sounds good so far , right ? wrong . first off magyver couldn't have built a phone with the same materials available . that's one major flaw . another is that the director does not know how to build suspense properly , so what should have been an exciting movie was boring . the director must have went to the william friedkin school of directing , friedken being the only other director able to skillfully make any action sequence boring . i . e to live and die in la ) this is a very exclusive club but not one that many directors aspire to be in . there are many other problems with cellular , including leaps of logic and plot holes , but i won't mention them all . max
472831	11423174	215750	2.0	way too depressing	Enemy at the Gates is set during ww2 during the Battle for Stallingrad . It is the story of a young Russian sharpshooter named Vassili and his battle with A German sniper known as Konig sent to assassinate him . Jude Law plays Vassilli , while Ed Harris plays the German sniper , Konig . Vassilli is quickly coming to fame for the amount of Germans he has shot and killed , which is leading to low morale of the German troops . So , Konig has been sent to kill Vassili and raise the moral of the German troops . there is more going on here but this is the main thrust of the story . The movie is exceptionally bleak in every aspect and is very hard to watch . there is an air of depression throughout the movie . i will definitely not watch this movie again .

472795	11423174	790806	2.0	lame ( in fact , you may wish you were on death row while watching this-at least you would have something to look forward to )	I'm sorry , but this movie was not good at all . the gore was not realistic , and the death scenes elicited big yawns from me . i saw no point to this movie . it is like hundreds of others and adds nothing to the horror genre . i found the acting bad even by horror movie standards . i could not finish the whole movie , because it made my jaw too sore from yawning . i don't think too many people would consider this movie a good use of their time . most people would probably stop watching long before the end . i don't know how many ways i can say this , but this movie is just not good . just in case i haven't been clear , i didn't like it . I'll give " Death Row "
473066	11423174	499665	2.0	i was not very impressed	( this review / comment is my own personal opinion ) this DVD really disappointed me . firstly , i found it tediously slow and boring . i don't think it was fun at all , unlike the 1960's cartoon . maybe that was the whole point , but it doesn't work for me . the 1960's cartoon may have been cheesy all around , but it was fun to watch . and had great sound effects . but his particular movie has none of that . i also think the animation is lacklustre . if you are new to Spider-Man , the origin they showed on this feature is not completely in keeping with the mythology . i had to quit watching after about 30 minutes , when i couldn't take any more . for me , this movie is a at best
472974	11423174	405422	2.0	just slightly above awful ( and i mean slightly )	first off , i will say this movie is better than " Anchorman : the Legend of Ron Burgundy . i mention " Anchorman " Because it has a bit of a connection to " The 40 Year Old Virgin " in that the producer of " Anchorman " ( Judd Apotow ) is also the producer of " Virgin " . i hated " Anchorman " saying in my review that " i would rather have my sinuses scraped " . while i didn't hate " Virgin " as much as " Anchorman " , i didn't think it was a good movie . there were some amusing moments , and there's a really hot chick in the movie . mostly though , i found it tedious , boring and non funny . there are many lame jokes in here and i don't mean that in any good way . this is one movie to avoid for the most part . i'll give it a for the hot chick and nothing else .
473552	11423174	130370	2.0	4th in the series ( in name only )	believe it or not , this movie is worse than number three . it's slower , the acting is worse , and the story is very weak . there isn't a lot of good to say about this movie . even the fight scenes are more dull than number three , and i would have thought that impossible . this is a very slow 90 minutes . painful , in fact . i stuck it through , hoping it would get better . if you really want to see this movie , you should try to find a cheap rental of it . it is hard to find ( for purchase , that is ) and probably for good reason . like number three , this movie has nothing to do with the first two . it is the same in name only . anyway , the most i can give Best of the Best : Without Warning is
473673	11423174	790604	2.0	where are the laughs ? ,	the certainly aren't in this movie . i did not laugh once , nor did i even smile . this is one of the most unfunny comedies i have ever seen . not only did i find it unfunny , i also found it non-entertaining . it's 88 minutes , without the closing credits , and in this case , it's 88 minutes too long . plus , the movie seems very formulaic to me , with nothing new . i hate to say it , but with this movie , they hit rock bottom , and kept digging . i didn't like Danny Devito or Mattthew Broderick in this thing . Kristen Davis was OK , but not great . the lone bright spot for me , in this movie , was Kristin Chenoweth . i thought she was pretty good as Devito's character's wife . otherwise , i don't think this movie was worth watching . for me , Deck the Halls is a
473474	11423174	243155	2.0	not a good movie , by any definition	this movie is not funny at all , not even mildly amusing . It is one long bore'm at a loss to understand why so many people rave about it . to be fair , it is a comedy drama / romance . it is dramatic alright , melodramatic . this is not a brilliant piece of work . there is romance , but who cares . the story is not compelling at all . as a matter of fact the whole movie is actually really depressing . however , i will say that Renee Zellweger's British accent is spot on . that is certainly no reason to recommend the movie . in fact there is no reason to recommend the movie . someone thought this thing merited sequel , which i would avoid as well . buying the DVD will definitely be money well wasted . but if you need a new coaster or a doorstop , or a Frisbee , then the disc contained in the DVD case could be an option . otherwise keep you money .
473559	11423174	454841	2.0	retread ( 2006 version ) improves very slightly on original ( 1977 ) ; still crap	the remake of the hills have eyes improves moderately on the original . there are fewer filler scenes , and the movie has a more clear direction . there are less drawn out , tedious sequences . things actually happen for more of purpose . no repetitive scenes of characters running around aimlessly , screening at the top of their lungs , just to fill the running time . not much suspense to speak of , but at least some action . the characters are none too bright , to be polite , so they all deserve to die . the lunatics are not scary in any way , and in fact are quite repulsive and stomach churning and not in a good way . there is of course more gore than the original , for no reason other than to show gore . pointless . the music at least is at least a very slight improvement , not grating and pointless , like the original . there is nothing new or original in this movie . really , there is not much more to say . very moderate improvement , still crap and still not worth watching . 1 . 5 & as opposed to for the original
472604	11423174	80745	2.0	Flash Gordon ( Saviour of the Universe Edition ) not good ( )	where to start ? right off the bat , it was apparent his was going to be one of those ' it's so bad it's good ' movies . and at first that's how i felt . soon , though the novelty wears off and the bad acting , bad writing , bad effects become annoying . plus , i could swear at times , the actors thought they were in a serious movie . but honestly , there's no real discernible plot , and the movie is a mishmash of other movies . it's all muddled . the dialogue is not good , lets just say . in my own personal opinion , there is absolutely no point to this movie . i remember seeing it when i was ten , and i liked it then . but i guess your tastes change as you get older . as for the special features , there isn't much of anything in depth . and the so called trailer for the sci-fi channels ' new Flash Gordon lasts all of about 9 seconds and shows nothing . if you are a fan of this movie , my advice is just to look for the regular version , which should be pretty cheap . and apparently , our friends overseas actually get the much better and in depth region 2 special edition which actually has features worth watching . so , if you can get you hands on a region 2 release and your DVD player supports region 2 discs ( you should find out first ) that would be your best bet . otherwise , it's a complete waste of time . but that's just one person's opinion . my vote for Flash Gordon ( Saviour of the Universe Edition )
473841	11423174	364725	2.0	it has David Hasselhoff ( that's not a good thing )	i honestly don't get the critics , especially those who heap praise on this film , even suggesting it is one of the funniest movies ever . as Chandler Bing ( " from " Friends " ) says - - could they BE more wrong ? most of the so called jokes in this turd are infantile at best . if you're three year old , you might find this thing amusing . but this tripe is probably beneath the intellect of most three year olds . so , why does this kind of thing get made . ? who knows . apparently there's market out there for this brand of humour . i looked high and low , but could not find Rob Schneider's name connected with this mess anywhere . if i had , the mystery would be solved . i really expect something like this effort from Schneider ( who should never be allowed near any movie set again . in fact i wish all the movie studios had a restraining order against him . that way , he can't get close enough to taint the movie ) sorry about the rant . anyway this movie does have the talented Thespian ( trust me , i'm kidding ) David Hasselhoff instead . things don't get much worse than this . i'm in a generous mood , so i'll give " Dodgeball : A true Underdog Story "
472688	11423174	804555	2.0	this movie is Wrong . . on so many levels	wow . this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time . the disgust factor is way too high in this one . i think they were going for the cheap gross out to try to shock the viewer . for me , all they succeeded in was making me nearly lose my lunch . the plot in this one is wafer thin , even for this type of movie . i'd say it was a horror movie , but it's more of a splatter fest than anything else . i don't mind gore and graphic violence in a movie , if there is a point to it . but to me , there was no point for this level of disgust . the effects and makeup are not done very well here , in my opinion . the first Wrong Turn movie was entertaining with interesting characters and some semblance of a plot . and it wasn't as unnecessarily disgusting . Wrong Turn 2 isn't even close to being in the same league . Henry Rollins is the only saving grace to this movie . as a result , i give Wrong Turn 2 : Dead End a reluctant
473564	11423174	416315	2.0	predictable ( yawn ) so called thriller based loosely on factual events	i saw Wolf Creek awhile ago and decided it was time to write a review on it . first off , it reminds me of Hostel , mainly because it was more brutal than necessary , in my opinion . there isn't as much gore as Hostel , but what gore there was , was taken to extreme in some scenes . it was supposedly based on a true story , but that means nothing in modern movies . the plot was nothing new , very predictable , as was much of the outcome . the one thing wolf creek has going for it is that there is some character development and so you are given the chance to feel for the characters when they are in jeopardy . i did care about what happened to the characters both from the character development and the acting which i thought was quite good . unfortunately , the same cannot be said for the rest of the movie . it has nothing new , no scares , just disgust more than anything . it is not as bad as Hostel , but for me , that's not saying much . if you must watch this movie , you should find a cheap place to rent it . but i wouldn't buy it . it's not worth it . lame .
473840	11423174	295427	2.0	this is a comedy ( if only it were funny )	in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises . unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs , somewhere no one will likely find them . this is billed as a comedy , which is OK , but it's not funny . it's not even amusing . it is however , stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie , but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script , ( or what passes for one , in this case ) Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent , but aside from the two " Wayne's World " films , he hasn't has a chance to showcase it . i kinda felt sorry for all involved . it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch . i'd have to give " Master Of Disguise "
472653	11423174	126707	2.0	the title says it all	i had high hopes for two came back . obviously the ending is predictable , given the title . basically , a group of friends agree to sail a yacht for someone from san diego to vancouver . along the way , they get caught in a massive storm and all but two of them perish . the main focus of the story centres not so much on the storm , but its aftermath . the crew is left adrift in the middle of the ocean and struggle to survive , as they hope to be rescued . of course as days pass , each of them deals with their plight differently and eventually , when they are rescued there are only two remaining alive . that is the gist of the story . i thought it would be a better movie than it was , but it was mostly a bore . most of the actors weren't convincing . then again , they didn't have a lot to work with dialogue wise , so they can't be faulted entirely . the scenes of the storm were pretty exciting , but fairly brief . pre teens will probably enjoy this movie , but if you are in your mid teens and older , don't expect to be too entertained .
473726	11423174	86955	2.0	unfunny , juvenile , infantile	i'm not sure how else to say it . the above summary pretty much describes my feelings on this movie . add to that , lots of crude language for no apparent reason , and you have the recipe for a bad movie . there is some language that Christians might be offended by . possible minor spoilerDudley Moore and Eddie Murphy appear in this movie , but as far as i know , they don't share any scenes together . at least they didn't through the forty minutes i was able to watch before quitting . end of spoiler . I found Murphy more annoying than anything , and Moore didn't really leave much of an impression at all . in all pretty much a waste of time . pretty close to awful , in fact . for me , Best Defense is a
473713	11423174	391198	2.0	a pointless , dull excursion	my friend and i watched the grudge on DVD , and neither one of us was impressed . it was basically a one note movie , involving a grey looking ghost / child who crawls all around on all fours and scares , even terrified its victims by opening its mouth end emitting what can only be described as a low pitched scream . some of the victims become so traumatized , they end up nearly catatonic and cannot speak of what they've seen , or heard . i mean really , this whole premise is hard to believe , because once the ghost shows itself , it is not remotely scary , forget about terrifying . the acting was not convincing in the least . i did however like the dark atmosphere of the film , which gave it a sense of foreboding . . . for all of five minutes , after which the novelty wears off . there are two things which are absolutely terrifying about the whole thing . the first is that i will never get back the minutes of my life spent watching this movie . the second is that someone thought it merited a sequel . as for the grudge itself - - - beige i . e bland and dull . pointless for the 5 minutes of atmosphere
473065	11423174	498348	2.0	couldn't watch more than 35 minutes before quitting due to extreme boredom	this movie has nothing to do with the first one . the actors and the characters are different . it starts out promising but quickly sputters . i could only watch it for about 35 minutes . i just found it way too slow and boring . Angie Harmon make for a compelling villain , except we are only given glimpses into her character . i know i hadn't watched it very long , but i just expected something more . i felt no tension or suspense and to be honest , i really didn't care about what happened . to me , it was just that uninteresting and not compelling . maybe sometime in the future i will attempt to watch the whole movie . in which case this review may or may not change , but as it stands , i give Glass House : The Good Mother a , based on Angie Harmon .
472861	11423174	402022	2.0	pointless bore beneath CharlizeTheron's talents	i'm not sure what Charlize Theron was thinking when she agreed to do this clunker . maybe she lost a bet or something . anyway , Aeon Flux is a movie way beneath her talents . she looks silly in that outfit and i get the feeling she didn't want be there . the dialogue was pathetic and cringe worthy , to say the least . the story was stupid . i will say one thing though , the movie is stylish and well photographed , there just isn't any substance . it's sort of like taking a 10 or 15 minute Saturday night live sketch and turning it into a 90 minute movie , and we all know how successful that's been . it just doesn't work . aeon flux is good as a series of short cartoons , but not as a movie . for one thing the characters are about as developed and fleshed out as they are for the cartoon . that works fine for an 8 minute cartoon , not for a movie . the movie is also painfully boring . somebody should have thought this through a bit more and stopped it way before it began filming . i'm betting it was nothing but a quick cash grab , with not much else in the way of thought entering the equation . pretty much pointless . a dud
473855	11423174	104139	2.0	Prescription : avoid this movie . . . and call me in the morning	there are not too many good things about this horror movie . one good thing is the performance of Larry drake as the psycho . he really puts his heart into the performance . you can tell he really has fun with the role . the only other good thing is that in the last 25 minutes or so , the movie starts to get good . the last 15 minutes in particular are really good , and there is one scene near the end which is priceless . unfortunately the first 70 + minutes are pretty lame . there really aren't enough positives are enough to make the movie worth watching . that's my opinion . anyway , this movie is part of the Twisted Terror Collection also sold in a box set also entitled The Twisted Terror Collection . there are 5 other horror movies contained in the set . as for this movie itself , i'm afraid it's terminal and the prognosis is not good .
473861	11423174	90180	2.0	to be bored to tears on my couch	i just don't see what all the fuss is about . many people have said this a great movie , and a good friend of mine raved about it . so , i watched it , expecting a good movie . wrong . this movie has the distinction of being the only movie i know of that can move at a frenetic pace and still be dreadfully boring . the characters aren't sympathetic , so you really don't care what happens to them . there is no character development and no reason for the characters to act the way they do . really , the whole movie had no point . if the director had slowed the movie down somewhere , rather than having what basically amounted to one big chase scene , the movie would have benefited greatly , as would the viewer . as it is , " to live and die in L . A " is to sit on your couch and be bored to tears . a complete mess . i only give this movie 2 stars because william peterson is in it
472964	11423174	331357	2.0	just slightly above awful	i wish i could say this is a good movie . but i would be lying . it isn't that it's awful , though it comes dangerously close at times . most of the acting is pretty bad , even for made for TV standards . much of the acting is either overacting , depending on the person . Joan Van Rark sinks to a new low in her role as the dip sh$t mayor of the small town in the path of a tornado . the dialogue she is given is laughable and her delivery is sad , to be polite . the really isn't much tension developed , considering the subject matter . there are some shots of cgi which are painfully obvious and at one point it looks like stock footage was used for on of the tornadoes . also , none of the characters are very developed , and from what we are shown , most are idiotic and unlikable . and finally , let me say that that if the majority of the human race was as dumb as these twits , we would not be around today . this film rates a only because it's not as bad as Evil dead 2 , Slither , or Lawnmower Man 2 .
473332	11423174	84695	2.0	funny	what a dog this thing was . i'm just glad i saw it on premium cable , and didn't lose any money on it . i did however lose 77 minutes of my life . it actually seemed like three hours before this thing finally ended . it's done in the style of the original Halloween , and the original Prom Night , but it's nowhere near as good as either of them . there are some very funny moments here , ( unintentional ) and the acting is worse than usual for this genre . the plot is also sillier than usual . yes , there are some scenes of naked women , but that is not enough to save this clunker . the only reason i got through it were the above mentioned funny moments , which i at least got a chuckle out of . for that , i give Slumber Party Massacre a
472986	11423174	896036	2.0	pretty awful	while not the worst movie i have seen , this one ranks right up ( or down ) there . it's a wild west / vampire movie , but it pretty much fails on both counts . there's very little action , and what little action there is is , is unexciting . the story isn't very good , although it could have been . i haven't heard dialogue this bad in a while , and it's delivered just as bad . this movie also tries to take itself seriously , which doesn't work here . there is no campiness , like there was in the first BloodRayne movie . the acting leaves a lot to be desired , and that may be because the actors realized how bad the movie was . Natassia Malthe plays the title character Rayne , and she looks pretty hot , but is given little to do , so it's hard to say if she is a good actress or not . she is given some horrendous dialogue , and doesn't come across very well , but again that could just be the material . i don't think i would base anyone's acting ability on this movie . just my opinion , of course . for me , BloodRayne II : Deliverance is a
473251	11423174	107618	2.0	boredom ( among other things ) reigns	oh , my word . i don't know what i just witnessed , but i know it wasn't good . this is not a good movie , at all . i'm not sure if i've ever been this bored in my life . it's supposed to be horror movie of sorts . the only problem is , they forgot to put in anything that would be scary . it's also done on the cheap , and looks it . the dialogue gives new meaning to the word abysmal . this thing may have been 95 minutes long , but it might as well have been 95 days , that's how slow it was . Tony Curtis plays a prominent role , but looks out of place in this movie . the only saving grace ( if there is in one ) is the actress who played the lead female character . she was more convincing than anyone else was . for that , i'll give The Mummy Lives a .
473632	11423174	72604	3.0	i didn't find it funny at all	i found this movie for a very cheap price and thought , how bad could it be . right off , i could tell the budget was next to nothing . at least it felt that way . it is supposed to be comedy , but from what i watched , it was not funny at all . i also noticed that the same manufacturer and distributer were also behind " Dan Candy's Law " . i think the production values are better on this film . at least the movement of the lips and the words matched , unlike " Dan Candy's Law " but i also thought the acting wasn't very good . Richard Pryor and Fred Williamson are the main characters , co the movie should have been funny , but to me it was not . i might try and watch it some other time , and maybe i will have a different opinion . but for right now , i didn't like it .
473194	11423174	295254	3.0	only the last 15 minutes or so offer any redemption to this movie	this movie isn't that great . in fact , it's not really even good . it's very slow , boring and depressive . OK , maybe depressive is what they were going for . still , there aren't many scares in this one . the characters are likable but barely developed . honestly , only the last 15 minutes offer any redemption to this movie . at that point there is a bit of suspense and action , but not enough to recommend the movie . you could save yourself a lot of time and skip the rest of the movie . otherwise , the movie feels incomplete , somehow . the other glaring problem with the movie is that the plot makes little sense , and there really is no connection between any of the the events that occur . the ending does little to tie anything up , either . probably not the worst movie you will ever see ( there are a lot of those to choose from ) still , i'm guessing , this will be closer to the bottom of most people's list than the top . i'll give it for somewhat likable characters .
472550	11423174	480249	3.0	. . . and i am merely confused	why ? well , i'm glad you asked . the reason is quite simple . this movie seems to have gotten rave reviews , and it has a high rating ( ) on this site . this really astounds me , since we are talking about a movie that has no real story , is dragged out and boring , and has underwhelming looking CG creatures . this movie is just over 90 minutes , but it sure felt a lot longer . my friend told me i fell asleep for about 10 minutes , but i did not miss anything , as he also said the movie was boring and nothing had happened in those 10 minutes . nothing really happens of any consequence here in 90 minutes either . i felt for poor Will Smith , having to carry a movie about nothing . he does his best , but when you have nothing to work with , it's an uphill and futile battle . for me , this is the most overrated movie i have seen since Pirates 1 . anyway , i give I am Legend a
472987	11423174	338130	3.0	does not come close to the quality of the TV show	this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame . the story is very weak , and there is little action . most of the characters are given little to nothing to do . the movie is mildly entertaining at best , but really doesn't go any where and is pointless . it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated TV show from the 80's . it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing , at least in my mind . it's only about 74 minutes long including credits , so i guess that's a good thing . unlike in the TV show , the characters are not worth rooting for here . in the show , you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day , but there , who really cares ? anyway , that's just my opinion . for me Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing
473135	11423174	365270	3.0	inferior clone of the original	this followup to the original Wildthings falls short in a lot of ares . it is nearly a carbon copy of the original plot structure . basically people betraying each other and being betrayed by others . however , there is no originality in this movie . the basic story has been done and much effectively in the original . there are a lot of twists and turns in this one , but they are very predictable , although ridiculous at time . the acting , while decent in the original , is less than decent in this movie . this is unfortunate , because the story itself is not good enough to carry the movie . you may find your eyelids drooping while watching this thing , as it is painfully slow at times . and you're eyes will glaze over and roll back in your head at the absurdity of the plot twists . i believe many of these plot twists were simply added to keep the movie at a certain running time . this movie is a much less than average effort out of 10
473584	11423174	112642	3.0	fitting it's about a ghost ,	since it has no soul . i think it's supposed to be a fun family movie , but i didn't see it . not only was this movie immensely dull , it was also depressing . talk a bout all style , and no substance . i made it about halfway through before i really wanted it to end . but i managed to watch right to th end credits . it has a few minor curse words , but nothing drastic . i think it would be appropriate for anyone over 10 , depending on how mature the child is , and how liberal the parents are . anyway , i wish i could say there were some fun moments , but i can't recall any , and i just finished watching the movie less than 10 minutes ago . there were some moments i'm sure were intended as comic relief , but they all came off flatter than a pancake . this is all just my opinion , and i'm sure a lot of people enjoyed the movie . but for me , Casper gets a
473551	11423174	80139	3.0	convoluted , incoherent and pointless	i can't say i liked this movie very much . it has some amusing moments , but it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama . it doesn't really work as either . it's too light in tone to be a drama , and the amusing moments are few and far between . it also doesn't make a lot of sense . things seem to happen for no reason . and it's also extremely convoluted . i feel like they just made things up as they were going . if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things , this might have been a better movie . i would say the ending was anti climatic , but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something , which it didn't . it just sorts ends , and that's that . i didn't find it boring , really , but like i said , there there just isn't any point . i'll give Winter Kills a reluctant and weak
473163	11423174	120804	3.0	it didn't work for me	i watched this movie a few years ago and remember liking it . but not this time . honestly , this movie is just one long bore , with a bit of action thrown in occasionally . it just doesn't work for me , plain and simple . there are two good things about it though . one is the pretty decent makeup effects , and the other is the music , kind of a techno / trance cross . otherwise , this felt like one of the longest 100 minutes of my life . to me , Doom is a better movie . it's fun and doesn't take itself seriously . Maybe Resident Evil would have been better if they had made it a bit lighter , or at least added some humour . or maybe not . but for whatever reason , i just didn't like it . for me , Resident Evil is a
472593	11423174	305669	3.0	not what i was expecting	for me , this movie was very disappointing . for 1 thing , ( spoiler ahead ) it is marketed as a comedy , yet , in my opinion it is a drama / action movie . there are a few mildly funny scenes , and maybe 1 or 2 very funny scenes . otherwise , this isn't a funny movie . the the subject matter is fairly dark , also . especially the dramatic scenes . there is a bit of action thrown in . however , if you are expecting a drop dead funny comedy , and instead end up watching a fairly dark drama , you might be disappointed . i wish studios would stop what almost amounts to false advertising , but that's how they hook people . if i remember correctly , almost all the funny bits were in the trailer . but everybody has different tastes , so some people may find the movie hysterical . anyway , that's just my opinion . i'd have to give ' Bringing Down the House ' at best
473613	11423174	303816	3.0	Roth's pre Hostel effort crap , but less crap than Hostel	Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth . Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth . this a zombie film , which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier " living dead movies " , and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's " Evil Dead " . there is nothing original here , and the story is not compelling . the acting is about par with this genre , it's just that the story fails . we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made . having said that , after having achieved commercial , if not artistic success from this movie , Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious , mean spirited , pointless ( though much more ambitious ) crap fest Hostel . Roth should have quit while he was behind . Cabin Fever is not a good film , however compared to Hostel it is a work of art . I hope somebody ( preferably a psychiatrist ) convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice . as for Cabin fever , a weak for not being as abysmal as Hostel .
473255	11423174	451187	3.0	move along , nothing to see here	as far as horror movies go , this one has nothing new . and the movie is pretty slow , but not as slow as some . for awhile the movie was just that , a slow horror movie . but then it degenerates into some absurd subplots that have no point to the movie . the acting becomes laughable , and the movie joins it . there's some completely pointless female nudity / lesbian / vampire scenes , which scream porno , in my mind . Christine Taylor , the lead actress , was OK , but nobody else really was . and calling this a horror movie is a big stretch . it's not scary in the least . it's also predictable for the most part . i also think it should have ended way before it did . as for the ending , i didn't like it . it was pointless , but that fit well with the rest of the movie . the only reason i don't give this movie a 1 or even a 0 is because i've seen many movies worse than this . i give Room 6 a
473873	11423174	111005	3.0	some books just don't translate to the ( big or small ) screen	this movie was very disappointing . not only was it exceedingly depressing , but it had zero suspension or tension . the whole thing was just one long drag . some people might like it , but it definitely is not my cup of tea . i haven't read the book , but i'm sure it is heads and tails above the movie in every respect . clearly many books do not translate well onto the screen . i won't say the acting was bad , because the actors had nothing to work with . this movie is truly one of the most tedious and hardest to get through , though not the worst movie i have ever seen . but if you read the book first , you will likely be very disappointed in the movie version . this is just my opinion , of course , but i'd have to give " Mortal Fear "
472806	11423174	256155	3.0	nothing in the way of thrills in this one ( in my opinion )	while this isn't anywhere near the worst movie i have ever seen , i wouldn't quite say i liked it . i won't go into the plot because it's pretty evident in the title . the scenes with the creature are OK , but nothing spectacular , certainly not exciting at all . there is not much excitement in the movie at all for my tastes . the creature looks OK , but there are very few actual scenes of it shown . basically , not very much happens throughout the whole movie . i found it very ponderous to the point of boredom . the acting is not bad , but the actors have little to work with . if you're looking for excitement or thrills , this movie won't likely do it for you . like me , you'll probably have that empty and unsatisfying feeling when the movie ends , if you make it that far . from me .
473433	11423174	67727	3.0	if you can get through the first 50 minutes or so . . .	this is one slow movie . it's about a family who gets murdered , and their blind daughter eventually discovers they are murdered and tries to get help , while avoiding being killed . there is almost nothing happening for the 1st 50 minutes or , and then things pick up , but nit much . the killer is never revealed until the end , and the end is pretty anticlimactic . the killings seem random , but if you pay close attention from the beginning , the killer may have what he perceives as motive , though it's very murky and twisted . the one good thong about this movie is Mia Farrow , who is very effective as the blind woman who terrified and alone . other than that , though , i wasn't very impressed . for me , See No Evil is a
472971	11423174	107387	3.0	" I Want me Gold " . . . .	and i want me 91 minutes and 22 seconds back . but , we don't always get what we want do we ? i guess this is supposed to be a horror comedy combination . well , if so , they left out the horror part . actually , they left out the comedy part too . mostly , this movie very slow and boring , but believe it or not , there are worse movies out there . Warwick Davis plays the Leprechaun , and it looks like has a blast in the role and is not taking it seriously at all , which is one good thing in the movie . Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie , which came out about a year before " Friends " . anyway , this movie spawned 5 sequels so far , and to be perfectly honest , it doesn't merit any sequels . for me , " Leprechaun " is a
472527	11423174	102517	3.0	I think i must have missed something	this movie is allegedly a comedy . so where did all the laughs go . did the forget to put them in , on the version i watched . as a football movie , it is mildly entertaining , i guess . maybe'm just a stick in the mud , with no discernible sense of humour . or maybe this movie just isn't funny . it is also annoying , with that way over the top " you're a winner " musical score . and the odd thing is , the team sucked through most of the season , only winning the last two games , and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs . so what is the point ? are they celebrating mediocrity ? I don't see it . if anybody knows , please let me know . anyway , this movie isn't great or even very good . i'm giving it a low
472902	11423174	100828	3.0	a sequel to 1974's Chinatown , lacking the same spark and imagination	this movie is the sequel to 1974's Chinatown . Jack Nicholson directed this film and stars again as Jake Gittes . Robert Towne wrote the script and the movie is based on characters created by him . it is hard not to compare this movie to its predecessor and comparisons are inevitable . so here goes . First off this movie plods along at a snail's pace . there doesn't seem to be a clear direction . Also , Gittes seems less likable this time around . the surrounding characters seem to lack any real imagination , as do the situations . put simply , there is no spark . and the femme fatalle angle , which worked so well in the original , doesn't work here . but then who could fill the shoes of the mega star charismatic actress Faye Dunnaway ? no-one . so , the femme in this case is less fatalle . the script is also lacking in imagination , giving the director ( Nicholson ) less to work with . you will be bored nearly to tears here . a disappointing followup to Chinatown . , as a stand alone film , however-also disappointing . this movie is not quite awful , but not quite good either . not recommended .
472917	11423174	165662	3.0	easily the weakest of the franchise	while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies , i didn't ' like this third and ( so far Final ) installment . i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much . there's a lot of filler here , which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie . i also wasn't too impressed with the acting . there was a lot of overwrought theatrics . as well , there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies , basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore . maybe i'm just imagining things , but this is my opinion on things . finally , this movie has none of the style of the second movie . adding it all up , this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts . my vote for Candyman 3 : Day of the dead is a
473337	11423174	433883	3.0	sucks	well , this movie was pretty bad . bad acting , bad story , mediocre special effects , and bad dialogue . the two main actors , Kristy Swanson and Judd Nelson seemed to be phoning in their performances just for a pay check . the supporting cast wasn't great either . the story was silly , and very slow . and i'm no physicist , but i'm guessing a lot of the science was inaccurate . in some movies , that doesn't matter to me . for example f the movie is exciting or has sympathetic characters , or a good storyline . this movie has none of those . i just could not get into this movie , and really just waited for it to end . the ending was abrupt and anti climatic , which isn't really surprising since the whole movie was anti climatic . for me , The Black Hole is a
473261	11423174	326856	3.0	I " Envy " anyone who hasn't had the misfortune	oh , my , this is just not good . this may have the designation of a comedy , but it's not funny . it is however boring and lame . Ben Stiller and Jack Black are in this one , so there should be some potential for laughs , but somewhere between the green lighting of the picture and the actual filming , things fell apart . just because something looks like it might be funny on the page , doesn't mean the movie will actually be funny . for me , the jokes all fall flatter than a pancake . i did watch this all the way through , in case it became funny , or at least amusing . even watchable would have been better than nothing . oh , well , such is life . at least i can warn others about it . assuming anyone reads this comment . after that , i absolve myself of any responsibility . since i'm in a generous mood , seems fair for " Envy "
473382	11423174	190865	3.0	spectacular views and not much else of consequence	lately , it seems the last few movies i have reviewed have basically been of the wall to wall action and realty defying stunts category . the same holds true for this movie . the only difference is , most of the action and stunts happen to occur high above sea level . on mountain to be exact . i actually almost hated this movie . there's little in the way of script , but to be far they just didn't have any room for it , what with all the explosions and stunts . the one redeeming feature this movie has-is the scenery . there are very breathtaking views . but other than that , i can't muster much enthusiasm . to tell the truth , despite nothing but stunt after stunt after explosion , several yawns escaped . i was bored out of my gourd . not a good sign . but , because of the spectacular views , i'll give " Vertical " Limit "
472713	11423174	284303	3.0	not good	hmmm , what to say about this movie . very , very low budget . CGI that looks very shiny and nice , but completely fake . for most of the movie , nothing happens , except a lot of talking . when the shark finally makes an appearance , it is underwhelming . it does not look that menacing . there is zero tension in the movie . there are only 2 good things in this movie . one is that the acting , surprisingly , is not that bad . and 2 , there are some deep underwater scenes showing some very unique and beautiful creatures . they are very obviously CGI , but they look very pretty , nonetheless . i sat trough the whole movie to see the shark . i wish i hadn't . 60 minutes of boredom for a few minutes of shark footage is not worth it . it's obvious they had zero budget , so they shouldn't have attempted this type of movie . i'll give it
473001	11423174	829482	3.0	from the producers of Knocked Up and The 40 year Old Virgin	it seems i'm in the minority here , but i didn't really like this movie . i just had no interest in it . i sort of chuckled at one moment , but that's about . i watched for 40 minutes , hoping it would get better , but it didn't . i guess it's just not my kind of humour . it's from the producers of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up , so if you liked those two movies , you might like this movie . there's a lot of foul language , including very frequent use of the f-bomb . it's definitely not for the easily offended . to me , the movie seemed like a bunch of skits strung together , rather than a whole movie , but that's just me . for me , Superbad is a
473655	11423174	452718	3.0	i really enjoyed The Littlest Hobo	maybe it's just me , but i thought this TV series was poor , at least until the last few episodes . for one thing , i just didn't buy any of the actors . they just didn't seem to be putting much effort into it , nor did o find the characters very interesting . i also felt the tone of the movie was too lite for the subject matter . i actually felt like i was watching an episode of The Littlest Hobo , that's ' how much depth i felt the show had . there's also a lot of repetition going on . if you watch the show , you'll understand . then there's the matter of the parents of one of the main characters . to me , they seemed like stock characters , with little to really do . they may as well have not been in the show . i also felt the series moved way too slow and was not very engaging , until the last 2 or 3 episodes . it's no wonder the show only lasted a season , and the fact that it did is amazing . since the last 3 episodes were an improvement over the rest of the series , i give Surface
472818	11423174	33467	3.0	i hate to say this but i was underwhelmed by this movie	OK , i'm certain i'm in the minority here , but whatever . i did not like Citizen Kane . first off , i didn't think it was profound at all . i also didn't think the look of the film was that great . many people say it has a great visual style , but i disagree completely . how this movie is number one all time on some lists is beyond me . to say this movie was a drag is understating things . there was and is too much hype for this movie . so it's directed by and stars Orson Welles . even worse is Welles is widely regarded as a genius as a result . big hairy deal . i was bored out of my skull . considering this movie is considered sacred and any negative comment is blasphemy , i'm glad nobody knows where i live , otherwise i fear i may be hunted down and killed . not too many people are likely to pay attention to this comment , but i don't care . this is how i feel about Citizen Kane . maybe i'm a complete idiot , or maybe i'm just missing something . either way , this movie rates a at best .
473877	11423174	331933	3.0	what do a turtle , a snail , and a sloth have in common ?	answer-they all move faster than this movie . man , this thing is a real coma inducing yawner . the rating is higher than i think it should be ( ) . if you're expecting to laugh , you can forget about it . this movie has very little going for it . i can only come up with two positives . one is Anne Archer , who is still a stunner at age 57 in 2005 , when this movie was released . the other positive is that there were a couple good songs . other than that , it's painful experience and a loss of 100 minutes of life , which will not come back . i didn't think this would be a great movie , but i thought it might be decent . i found it hard to actually finish watching , but i stuck with it . hopefully i can convince others not to waste their precious time . for me , " Man of the House " is a
472530	11423174	107144	3.0	too much forced humour , very few laughs	hmmm . this movie was definitely not as good as the first one . they tried too hard for laughs this time around . in the first one , they made the laughs seem so effortless . this time there were too many pratfalls , too much physical comedy . there was like the first film a couple of very funny scenes , but the rest was too forced . they tried to jam to much comedy into the movie , at the expense of everything else . the actors weren't as convincing in this film . most of the film bordered on being absurd , even ludicrous , and not in a good way . fairly lame all around actually . i'm glad they stopped at 2 , because a 3rd one would have been beyond ridiculous .
473221	11423174	88912	3.0	poorly conceived and executed	weird . this is a TV movie , yet the rating on the box says it's rated R . there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an R rating . aside from that , though , the movie is very slow and pointless . i mean the idea was good , but nothing was done with the storyline . it just wasn't developed . it's mildly creepy , and the acting is actually quite good , better than the movie deserves . i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon , if ever . there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one . i haven't seen too many Wes Craven Films , so i can't really compare it to any of his others . as for this movie itself though , i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed . for me , i can't give Chiller a higher rating than
473867	11423174	432291	3.0	totally unnecessary remake	why ? why remake a true modern classic ? maybe the filmmakers thought they could make a few quick bucks . a few bucks is more than they deserve for this movie . the director tried to sex up the movie , i guess for modern audiences , but this was one thing that ruined the movie . there aren't many scares to speak of and the acting was okay , i guess but not great by any stretch . i didn't feel invested in any of the characters . i also didn't like the way they changed the ending . it wasn't logical and didn't fit with the plot . the only decent thing was the special effects and that was a small part of the movie . not enough to recommend it . i give it low three , based on the effects alone . not a worthy remake . unnecessary
472837	11423174	109830	3.0	overrated maudlin inspirational speech	many people love this movie , some even calling it a work of art . however , i must respectfully disagree . i found the movie uninspiring , at best , at mostly one long bore . if you like your movies heavy on sap , you will like this movie . this movie at times felt like one long " i'm okay , your okay , we're all okay " inspirational speech . if i want motivational advice , i'll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru . all kidding aside other than the film's heavy handedness , there are a few good thing about it . the acting was good , the special effects were decent . the best thing about the movie , however is its 1960's and 70's soundtrack . despite it good points , the movie is not worth recommending .
473002	11423174	787475	3.0	i don't see the appeal	maybe it's just me , but while watching this movie , i was reminded of Napoleon Dynamite , which i thought was a depressing bore . while i don't think this movie was as bad , i still didn't really enjoy it . i found it unfunny , and not amusing . i didn't really care about the characters . i didn't get the jokes , and i don't understand the appeal of the movie , but that's just me . if you liked Napoleon Dynamite , you might like Hot Rod . for some reason , the last 20 minutes or so became mildly interesting , though i'm not sure why . Sissy Spacek and Ian McShane are in this movie , and i think their talents deserve better than this . this probably sounds a bit harsh , but the most i can give this movie is a
472534	11423174	100258	3.0	a horror movie without horror . . . or suspense . . or tension	i just watched night of the living dead on scream channel . suffice to say , i wasn't very impressed . there was zero tension in the whole movie . i was too bored to care about the characters . and what's with that ending ? it seems like it was tacked on , when they couldn't think of any other way to end it . it was just over . there was no logic behind it . another failure i thought was the so called makeup effects , which did not look at all real . and if you watch carefully some of the actors playing zombies were not always in character , that is they didn't act like zombies . i can't compare it to the original , which i haven't seen , but i will say it doesn't compare with the 2005 version of dawn of the dead , or even 2006's land of the dead . if i could describe this movie in one word , it would be - - underwhelming
472908	11423174	419358	3.0	bloated	i thought the original Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) was a very good disaster movie , while this 2005 update , a near 3 hour miniseries , is a near disaster itself . this thing is bloated and overwrought . the dialogue borders on silly ( to be kind ) at times , and there is an an abundance of over acting . there are some decent actors , here , but most are wasted . i especially thought Adam Baldwin was particularly pointless . the one saving grace in this dept . is Rutger Hauer , who i thought was effective in his role as a bishop . SPOILER AHEADthere is no rogue wave , which causes The Poseidon to capsize . in fact , there are no waves at all . instead , the makers of the movie decided to make this about terrorism , so a bomb capsizes the ship . END OF SPOILERalso , this movie is not very exciting , and it just goes on too long . it certainly does not hold a candle to the original , and it is not even as good as Beyond The Poseidon Adventure , the sequel to the original . for me , The Poseidon adventure ( 2005 ) is a weak
472888	11423174	371920	3.0	cybernetic dog goes on killing spree , but why ?	well , . i'm not sure what i was expecting , but this wasn't it . the plot for this thing is all over the map , with some subplots added in that have very little relevance . actually , the movie has very little relevance . the acting was not good and the dialogue was forgettable . as for the dog , it was not realistic . it was very clear that many of its movements were controlled by puppeteers . the look of the dog was ugly , but not scary . there were buckets of gore in this movie , and poorly done . i hope the makeup and prosthetic teams didn't get paid very much . also , there was no back story explaining the dog's evolution and motivation for killing . it just seemed to kill out of blood lust . what led to that ? the ending was very bleak and morbid and the last scene is a complete rip off of terminator 2 , but with the cyborg as a dog . honestly , there wasn't much point to this movie . it was mildly entertaining at best . / 10
473659	11423174	659619	3.0	pretty boring and lame	this is an episode of the New Scooby Doo movies from 1972 . it has Scooby and the gang meeting up with the Harlem Globe Trotters and running into a mystery , ( naturally ) with ghosts , and a sea serpent . this episode is very slow and and the story is kinda lame . there's a few good lines courtesy of the Globe Trotters , but otherwise it's pretty boring . and that laugh track drove me nuts . by the way , not to give anything away , but the episode takes place in America , not Scotland , so the words Loch Ness in the title don't mean anything . anyway , you'd think this might be an interesting story , since it features the Harlem Globe Trotters , but it isn't . they didn't even have the real voices of the Globe Trotters , for whatever reason . the most i can give this episode is a
473892	11423174	263488	3.0	forget this one , check out the superior sequel instead	i actually commented on the sequel to this movie , thinking i would never bother to write a comment on this one . the sequel is actually not bad , but the original is not so good . i found it boring and mean spirited even for a so called horror movie . it doesn't really make a lot of sense either . and i found it depressing as anything . plus , the ending was just ridiculous . i know the sequel didn't necessarily make a lot of sense . but it had other positives going for it , like excitement , and a really nifty looking creature . anyway , i pretty much hated the original , and although it's not the worst movie i have seen , it is pretty bad . my advice , skip this movie and check out the sequel instead . for me , Jeepers Creepers is a
473231	11423174	117420	3.0	oh , brother	i hate to say this , but this movie is dumb , even for a Van Damme flick . the story is stupid and slow and has no flow at all . the fight scenes are nothing special , similar to blood sport but pale in comparison . Roger Moore is in this one , and may be the only good thing about this mess . and just once , is it too much to ask for Van Damme to actually sound like his character is from the locale in the movie . his accent never changes , no matter what nationality his character is supposed to be . in this one He plays Christopher Dubois , a Frenchman in NewYork in the mid 1920's . how about playing a character with a NewYork accent ? it's obvious Van Dammme never took any dialect lessons or tried to change his accent in any way , which is what makes most of his movies more than a bit absurd . and don't even get me started on the title . i mean " The Quest " , how original . but then again the movie has no originality either , so i guess it's fitting that the title should follow suit . anyway , Van Damme directed and co-wrote the story with Frank Dux . all i can muster is for Roger Moore
472622	11423174	67525	3.0	second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel , I am Legend	this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel , I am Legend , the first being The Last Man on Earth , starring Vincent price , and the third bearing the same title as the novel and , starring Will Smith . i really enjoyed the first version , and pretty much hated the third version . this version is , much closer to the third version , in terms of my opinion of it . i found a lot of this movie lame , lacking in any real excitement . the acting was pretty poor ( though Heston wasn't too bad ) . i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times , and there is no real air of mystery to the story . having said that , there was one good thing about it . this one had a plot , ( as slow as it was ) which i felt the third one didn't . it was just this side of boring , for the most part , occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom . i was able to get through it . but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again . it just really didn't anything for me . my vote for The Omega Man is a
473578	11423174	75200	3.0	a real dog	while i didn't mind the original The Shaggy Dog ( 1959 ) , i thought this sequel was not too good . i found it way too silly and absurd , and not realistic . by that , i'm not talking about the premise , a man transforms into a dog . that i can accept as being within the confines of the movie . what i found unrealistic was how most of the characters acted and or reacted . too say there was some overacting going on would be a massive understatement . i also didn't find the characters endearing . i did however find them annoying . and the acting in general was unimpressive . and i found the ending abrupt with no real resolution . i'd say this would be a good family movie , a family comprised of only 3 year olds . maybe they ran out of money or time . whatever . this film had none of the fun or charm of the original . for me , The Shaggy D . A . is a weak
473530	11423174	329717	3.0	no comedic chemistry between Ford and Hartnett	i was so disappointed with this movie . a buddy cop film with Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford should have had potential , shouldn't it ? Ford and Hartnett play two cops who are partners and who also have second hobs to make ends meet or to have financial independence . they are called in to investigate the murder of a rap group . hilarity should ensue , right ? if by hilarity , you mean endless yawning , then yeah , hilarity ensues . this one really hurt my brain . it was agonizingly boring to the nth degree . i think i saw this at a cheap theatre , but what ever i paid was exactly that amount more than i should have paid . i think they should have payed me to see this thing . i think the real problem with this movie , is their is no chemistry ( the comedic kind ) between Ford and Hartnett and that pretty much sinks the whole movie . for me , " Hollywood Homicide " is a
472725	11423174	119640	3.0	close to awful	i had high hopes for this movie before watching it . but , maybe i shouldn't have . after all , it does star Tom Arnold . some of the films he is in are OK , especially where he is not the main character . but this one , not so much . it's billed as a comedy , but that entails laughter . it's based on the 1962 series of the same name , supposedly . if that's case , the makers of the TV show should sue the makers and actors involved in this movie for defamation . i like Debra Messing , but she picked the wrong movie to be a part of . Tim Curry also stars , playing a variation of every bad guy he has ever played . the plot is silly , to be kind . the back cover promises madcap adventure and and zaniness . maybe it's a typo . it's no wonder this movie tanked at the box office . for me , McHale's Navy is a
473573	11423174	122933	3.0	i guess the dramatic parts are alright ( i could have worn this was marketed as a comedy )	i'm sorry to say , that as a comedy , this movie isn't funny . there are maybe one or two somewhat amusing scenes , otherwise , there's not much here to laugh about . the movie is basically about a crime lord ( Robert Deniro ) who decides he needs a psychiatrist to get in touch with his inner feelings . turns out , he's quite insecure . so he enlists the help of Dr . Ben Sobel ( Billy Crytal ) who very reluctantly and with a little persuasion , takes him on as a patient . sounds like it could be funny , right . well , for whatever reason , it's not . in fact , it's excruciatingly boring at times . it's not the actors . there all fine . well , mostly , anyway . Chazz Palminteri is decent in supporting role , but Lisa Kudrw is completely wasted in this movie . it has a rating of on this site . for me , i'm afraid it's nowhere near that . " Analyze This " gets a from me .
473375	11423174	38284	3.0	poor western	this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen . i found it much too slow . it just plodded along to the inevitable end . i also found it disjointed . i couldn't wait for it to be over . Randolph Scott is the headliner here , and Lloyd Bridges also stars . but for my money money Edgar Buchanan is the best of the bunch . Buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day , many times providing comic relief , as he does in this picture . i also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita . otherwise , though , i can't think of much to recommend this movie . the movie is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock , who also wrote the novel Stagecoach , which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 , and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 . The 1939 version of Stagecoach , is in my mind , one of the best movies ever made . anyway . as for Abilene town , my vote is a
473605	11423174	82782	3.0	instead of dumb teens as victims , we have dumb adults who should know better	for a slasher / horror movie , this one has very little graphic gore , compared to many of the genre . this kinda surprised me while watching it . but then i read a user comment saying that the censors really butchered this one , forcing the filmmaker to leave out a lot of gore . anyway . . . one thing which really stood out for me about this movie is the acting . well , the lack of , actually . i haven't seen acting this bad since the last time i saw acting this bad . the other thing of note is the stupid characters . many slasher flicks have dumb , oversexed , drunk or stoned teenagers as the victims . that's bad enough . but here we have dumb , oversexed , drunk or stoned adults as the victims . truly pathetic . you can kinda expect it from teens , but adults should just know better . the only good thing about this movie is towards the end , which holds a surprise i wasn't expecting . i won't give it away , so unfortunately for you ( or not , depending on your tastes in movies ) you'll have to watch the movie . i doubt this will be the worst movie you'll ever see , but for me , it just isn't very good . For me , " My Bloody Valentine " is a
473468	11423174	462482	4.0	very interesting premise ; script does not do it justice	this is an interesting tale as far as ghost stories go . i won't go into the plot because i don't want to give anything away . unfortunately , the premise is interesting , but the rest of the movie plods along at a snail's pace . there is next to no action . the story is very dialogue driven and not enough is done with the premise . the movie is almost incomplete in a sense because the central issue is barely explored , and very little background is given as to the reasons for the strange goings on in the town , ( true we are given some surface explanation ) at least not in depth . there really is no payoff , no climax to speak of . the movie ends as quietly as it began . the acting in the move is good , the movie is photographed well , but the script doesn't do justice to its central theme . i'd have to say Population 436 rates due to its creative though ultimately unexplored plot line .
472703	11423174	388419	4.0	i'd watch it on cable or as a cheap rental first	my sister and i just watched this movie yesterday , so i thought i would put in my two cents . she liked it more than i did . i didn't think it was very funny . in fact , i never laughed once . but i did think it was passable entertainment , for the most part . a few times i did get bored though . i just found it hard to believe that the people on one street in town would go to so much trouble to make one family celebrate Christmas . and for me , i didn't fee any chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis , who played the husband and wife who decided to skip Christmas this year . Dan Akroyd played the neighbour who had the most influence in town , and tried to get the Cranks ( Allen and Curtis ) to celebrate the season . mostly i just found him annoying . M . Emmet Walsh was in the movie , and i liked his character . anyway , overall , i'd say this is a movie to catch on cable or as a cheap rental . interestingly , this movie is based on a John Grisham novel , called Skipping Christmas . i wouldn't rate it any higher than
473672	11423174	89961	4.0	for a movie base on joyous occasion , i didn't find it very joyous	i don't know what to think about this movie . i didn't hate it but i didn't really like it either . here's why . i thought the whole atmosphere of the the movie was sad , almost depressing at times . and i felt the music overpowered the movie at times . it just got to be a bit too much . normally the colour scheme of a movie isn't something i think about . however , this movie seems to have colours that were much too muted for it's subject matter . the colours just weren't very bright . i'll admit that the movie approaches being something close to magical at times , but , for me , it doesn't quite get there . it's also slow paced . i think even children will be bored with it at times . for me , the movie was more of a loud spectacle than anything else . i don't think too many people will be filled with joy while watching this movie . it's bearable at best , at least in my opinion . my vote for Santa Claus : The Movie is a
473437	11423174	118604	4.0	if you liked An American Werewolf in London , . . . ( )	you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel . AWIL is a classic . but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get . what a joke . special effects that aren't very special , horrible dialogue , non acting . and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly , ( not to mention fleeting ) tacked on with about a third of the movie left . did i mention the story is less then lame . there's no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie , yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way . the rating it currently has ( ) is too generous if you ask me . my rating for An American Werewolf in Paris : a
473376	11423174	39152	4.0	substandard John Wayne western	this western is more of a character study than anything else , and a romance . there isn't a lot of action . it's not the worst movie i have seen , but i do felt it went on too long . i felt it was too tedious . there were several times when i thought it was over , and could / should have been over , but it kept going . i think they could have told just as good a story if they had shortened the film . it's definitely not one of my favourite westerns , nor one my favourite John Wayne westerns . it's certainly no classic , in my opinion . i know many people would disagree with that sentiment , which is fine . i wouldn't likely watch it again , at least for a long time . for me , Angel and the Badman is a
472686	11423174	455362	4.0	think Cujo but with more and smarter dogs	this movie has elements of other movies , some better ( Cujo , Man's Best friend ) some not as good ( Rottweiler ) . the idea of a group of people stranded on an island and fighting for their lives is nothing new , either . this particular movie doesn't really add anything new to the genre . it's also pretty slow , with not very much suspense or tension . yet i found it just interesting enough to be entertaining . by entertaining , i mean , i think's worth a cheap rental , and i wouldn't buy it unless you can get it cheap . for me , the movie held promise , but just didn't deliver . i wasn't overly interested in any of the characters . for me , The Breed is a
472952	11423174	158242	4.0	felt more like a romance movie than anything else	i didn't really like this movie . i found it too boring and slow , without much of a pay off . also , to me it was more of a romance movie than anything . there are a couple good scenes of some twisters , but not enough . the acting was okay , i guess , but not spectacular . of all the movies of this genre i've watched , this is one of the slowest . if you do watch this movie , be prepared to sit through some really slow scenes before the action begins . and once the action begins , it is all too brief . i would'nt say this movie is atrocious , because i have seen a lot of worse movies in my time . however , i will say that this movie just didn't do it for me . i'd have to give ' Storm Chasers : Revenge of the Twister '
473915	11423174	83598	4.0	boring ! boring !	this Al Pacino vehicle didn't do much for me . Pacino plays a playwright struggling with writing his latest play , while dealing with all kinds of personal issues . i found it boring , boring , and more boring . i just didn't see the point of it all . to say it's moves at a sedate pace is an understatement . it hardly moves at all . Pacino is good , but i felt his character is underwritten . the kids are cute , but not enough to carry the movie . in short , i couldn't wait for this thing to end . i really wanted to turn it off several times , but i stuck it through to the bitter end . it wasn't worth it . but that's just my opinion , maybe i'm wrong . for me , Author ! Author rates a
472650	11423174	116629	4.0	great potential , but suffers from too many flaws	independence day looked like it could be a good , even great movie . it has great actors , and loads of action . it also has some humour courtesy will smith and jeff goldblum . goldblum is the perfect straight man for smith's witty quips and one liners and even ads a bit of his own brand of comedy to the mix . these two play off each other very well , and there is undeniable comedic chemistry between the two . the supporting cast is also very strong . and then there is the premise . aliens invade the world and the military must save the day . not a bad premise , although not original . there must be something new added to the mix or this becomes just another alien invasion movie . the question is , is there anything original in this movie ? true , the comedic element is a step in the right direction . but is in enough own its own ? not quite . there are problems which overshadow the positive aspects of the film , one of them being the special effects , which admittedly are well done . however , they are overpowering in this movie . the viewer is bombarded with explosion after explosion . independence day becomes a movie about the special effects , so the characters take a back seat for most of the movie . true , there are some touching dramatic moments in the middle to latter stages of the film , but the characters are not given enough screen time to be developed , so there is less of the human feel than there might otherwise be . another problem is the film goes more than a little overboard with the flag waving patriotism . there is nothing wrong with patriotism , unless it is taken overboard . there is an inspirational speech given by the the American president , which seems like it is patterned after a speech by winston churchill during the second world war . however , in this case it comes of as maudlin and absurd . bill pullman , fine actor he may be , is no winston churchill , and does not have the charisma or screen presence to carry this speech off . it is a real eyes glazed over and rolled back in the head moment . not believable . which lead us to the dialogue . aside from the president's speech there are are other examples of cringe worthy dialogue . the actors cannot therefore take total responsibility for this . the writers should shoulder some of the blame . finally there is the discovery which leads to the eventual defeat of the aliens . in my my mind the odds of things happening this way are astronomical at best . so , basically the movie ( although entertaining ) fails for the most , and is moderately successful in other parts . end result : out of 10
473226	11423174	106965	4.0	i expected something more , but young kids will probably like it	i kinda expected something else . what , i'm not sure . i mean the movie is well made and all , but i found it dangerously close to being boring at times . it is pretty slow . the scenes with the whale ( s ) were nice though . and the there are some pretty touching moments . i didn't find the movie had a lot of realism to it though . the way some of the things happened just didn't ring true . but , i guess the biggest problem i had was there wasn't really much sense of adventure , and the movie isn't really fun . however , if you are looking for a movie the whole family can watch , this might be it . most kids will probably be entertained , and adults will be happy there is something their kids can watch . but for me , Free Willy is a .
473479	11423174	85750	4.0	pretty tedious ( painfully at times )	before anything else , i should mention that this movie was originally in 3d , but on this disk , the movie is not in 3d . the " Jaws " series falters quite a bit , with this entry . i found the story too hokey for my taste . this movie also strays from the formula of the first two , opting for me spectacle and noise than anything . Dennis Quaid , Louis Gossett Jr , and Simon MacCorkindale are in this one . Lea Thompson also has a small role . i feel pretty confident in saying this movie was not a shining moment in any of their careers . most of the film is a stinker and very tedious . the only saving grace is the last 35 minutes or so , where there is some action and a tiny amount of intensity , along with a twist of sorts , i guess . otherwise , there is not much to recommend here . it's nowhere near the worst movie i have seen to date . that title belongs to " Dracula 3000 " , which i don't see being dethroned any time soon . but , back to " Jaws 3 " i don't think i can muster more than for this one .
473162	11423174	318627	4.0	faster pace , more action than the first , still not that great	i guess this movie is better than the first Resident Evil . there is more action and a bit of humour , which is sorely lacking in the first one . and i like the characters more in this one . i think it was a better mix of personalities . what i didn't like is the story . this one is more about the action and there is quite a bit more than the first one . you know , people getting shot and dying , lots of stuff blowing up , that sort of thing . sometimes the movie borders on the ridiculous with some of the stunts they do . plus there is some totally gratuitous nudity that does nothing to movie the story . don't get me wrong , i like nudity as much as the next guy , but it should have some point . anyway , if you're an action junkie , you might like this movie . other than that , there's not much here . having said that , i do you like it better than the first movie , because it is not mind numbingly boring , as the first one was .
473919	11423174	493459	4.0	i found it mildly entertaining , and informative to a point	for me , this film was mildly entertaining at best . it has a lot of information , but how accurate it is , is any body's guess . the filmmakers have their view on things , and so the film probably reflects their views . i'm sure a lot of what they show and say is accurate to a point , but i think some things you have to take with a grain of salt , like most things . i think you sort of have to come to your own conclusions . this is just my opinion , of course . anyway , the film basically deals with trying to find out the identities of the M . P . A . A . the people who make up the Motion Picture Association of America . these are the people who give ratings to films . i found it interesting how the filmmakers went about trying to uncover their names but i also think that maybe the M . P . A . A . has has some good reasons for wanting the identities of its members kept secret . i mean , they may hand down a rating for a film which could negatively affect its box office and critical performance . that could mean lost revenue . you can imagine a filmmaker being angry over receiving an N-17 ( the kiss of death ) instead of an R . so maybe thee identities of the people on the ratings board are kept secret to protect them . i don't really know , i'm just speculating . the other thing is that the ratings board is not part of the government . they are an independent body , and they are not elected , so in my view , they shouldn't have to reveal their identities . doing so might give them a better relationship with filmmakers though , or it might not . . there is some other stuff in the movie , as well , but i found a lot of the stuff dry and not that interesting . i agreed with some things the filmmakers said and i disagreed with some things as well . anyway , i think the film is an OK way to waste 90 minutes or so , but i didn't find it profound or earth shattering . but again , that's just my personal opinion . the film might be more interesting if you watch it with a group of people . at the very least , it could provide some lively discussion , and get people thinking . anyway , like i said , theses are just my views . i should mention there is a lot of nudity and foul language in the movie , so this might not be to your taste . there is some violence , but i felt it wasn't that graphic . in my opinion , This Film is Not Yet Rated is a
473335	11423174	63035	4.0	huh . . .	i had read a lot of comments saying this was a terrible movie , that depicted the Green Berets in an inaccurate lite . i don't know too much about that subject , but i did watch the movie , and i was disappointed . i thought it was a real mess . tonally speaking , it was all over the place , at times lightly comedic , at times dramatic , and other times semi serious . i don't think this movie was intended to be a comedy , but it comes off in spots like an episode of the TV series M . A . S . H . my own opinion is that this particular subject was treated much liter than it should have been , and with less respect . as for entertainment value , even the action scenes were not that great , and in the dramatic moments , i felt that most of the actors weren't really putting a lot of effort into it . plus , the movie was quite preachy , with as much subtlety as sledge hammer to the head . the current rating is a , but i wouldn't give it that much . for me , The Green Berets is a
473099	11423174	891527	4.0	could have been so much better	i didn't particularly think much of this movie . there isn't really a lot of substance to it . at times it feels like a recruitment ad more than movie . and i also found it a bit too preachy , yet i don't quite know what kind of message it was trying to send . really it was sending mixed messages . basically , i found it confusing . plus , there are some things that don't make sense , which i won't get into here . Tom Cruise barely has any screen time , nor Does Meryl Streep , for that matter . Robert Redford , who also directed the movie , has the most screen time , but even his time is limited . anyway , i wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone , but that's just my opinion . for me , Lions for Lambs is a disappointing
472697	11423174	306047	4.0	boring , tedious and unfunny ( )	i don't know where to begin with this movie . i mean it isn't as sick as number two , but it is less funny than one or two . it's not as low brow , but there aren't really any laughs here . i found it quite boring and tedious , for the most part . there were some parts that may have been intended as being funny , but they come off just plain dumb . The only bright spot in this movie ( if there is one ) is Anna Farris , who has a lot of talent , but ii think she is wasted in this movie . there are also a few scenes which are in poor taste . overall , this i think this movie is a drop in quality from the first two . for me , Scary Movie 3 is a at most .
473727	11423174	99316	4.0	too talky and slow ( )	i wanted to like this movie , and i really tied . but in the end , i just couldn't justify it . it's billed as a comedy , except it's not funny . or even amusing . i will say that the two lead actors , Daryl Hannah and Dudley Moore are appealing , as are their characters . but the movie is just too slow and talky for my tastes . and there's also too much swearing for no good reason . it doesn't add anything to the movie , and it doesn't really have any relevance . the movie has an ensemble cast of well knowns from the time period ( in this case , 1990 ) , but they can't save this movie . it's not quite horrible , but it certainly isn't very good , either . for me , Crazy people is a
472597	11423174	338034	4.0	too much slow drama , not enough action for my taste	i though this film was okay . i din't think it was great . it was a bit too slow for my taste . lots of drama , but not very much action until close to the end of the film . this movie was basically a dramatic film , with the payoff , if you can call it that , not until near the end . to me , the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town , were okay , but much too brief . the film itself is done okay , the acting is decent , but it just didn't do it for me , in the long run . think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie . at least that's what i think . the other factor is that i had just recently watched ' 10 . 5 ' and its sequel ' 10 . 5 : Apocalypse ' . these are 2 big budget " event movies , which , in my opinion , are a very hard act to follow , in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction . as a result , i have to rate Killer Flood : the Day the Damn Broke at
472761	11423174	66344	4.0	bah , humbug	this is another adaptation of A Christmas Carol , this one starring Albert Finny as Ebeneezer Scrooge . the only other version i have seen so far is the 1951 version starring Alistair Sim . there is no comparison between the two . i loved the 1951 version , and thought Sim was very natural in the part and inhabited the character without effort . in this one , Finny's portrayal is over the top , as is the character itself . plus , there's lots of filler in this adaptation . there's a lot of musical numbers , which just annoyed me . i actually don't mind some musicals , when i am expecting them . but i wasn't expecting this to be musical . the movie even descends into farce , at one point , in my opinion . to top it all off , it's very slow and ponderous . this is all just my opinion , and others may like it . if you like musicals , and you're in the mood for one , you might like this version of a Christmas Carol . for me , i it was all i could do to quit watching before the end .
472705	11423174	483726	4.0	falsely advertised as a comedy	i found this Robin Williams vehicle mildly amusing at best . i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts . it's about a political talk show host / comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins . i found most of the humour dry myself , and Robin Williams is much more restrained and sedate than usual . i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy , with a bit of mystery and suspense . i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts , and the mystery and suspense aspect ( though that's a small part of the movie ) worked the best . still , i wouldn't rate this movie very high . for me , it was an OK waste of 2 hours , but nothing special . my best advice would be to catch it on TV / cable or rent it cheap first , before making a decision on whether to purchase . my vote for Man of The Year is a
473651	11423174	120800	4.0	lacklustre story , too many songs	this animated movie was OK , i guess , but nothing special . the most annoying thing about it , to me , was that there were too many musical numbers , and not enough story . plus , the musical numbers themselves were kinda mundane , in my opinion . and they slowed the whole movie down , ruining any flow it might have had . the animation didn't really stand out , either . this is not a movie for young children . there are a few moments which would be a bit scary for them . there were a few funny moments , but not enough to elevate the movie . i also felt the voice actors didn't always suit the characters . finally , the movie just wasn't fun . overall , a disappointing effort .
473224	11423174	113114	4.0	disappointing in the extreme	the best thing about this movie is that there are more scenes with the whales . other than that , i can't say i liked it very much . it is shorter than the first one , but feels a lot longer . this movie felt too much like an ecology lesson to me , and it wasn't subtle either . i just found the whole thing overwrought , and i though there was a bit of overacting going on . they had a subplot going on , which i didn't think was necessary , but that's just me . there were some emotional scenes , but i felt like i was being manipulated . towards the end , there are a few tense moments , but overall , the movie is disappointing . if it weren't for the scenes with the whales , this would be a 1 or 2 star movie . i guess for me , Free Willy 2 is a
473821	11423174	433588	4.0	very bleak	this is an ' inspired by true events ' movie . it's a bleak movie , to be blunt about it . it's about a woman who had done nothing but lie cheat and steal her whole life . as a result her and her young daughter live a life on the run from the law . i found this movie slow and boring for the most part . it doesn't have a happy ending , ( at least to me it doesn't ) like some movies of this genre have . and it doesn't resolve anything or tie up any loose ends , like i hoped it would . i only kept watching for two reasons . one was the hope that there might be a happy ending . tow was that the acting was pretty decent . so , basically the movie is only worth watching for the performances . as a result , my vote for Lies My Mother Told Me is a
472848	11423174	97388	4.0	boring	i know this is called Jason Takes Manhattan , butspoiler aheadManhattan has nothing to do with the movie until less than 20 minutes remain . end of spoiler . anyway , this is one boring movie . i had to fight from turning it ff before the end . there are a couple of funny moments , particularly the reaction ( or rather non reaction ) of the New Yorkers to Jason . mostly though , the movie is just silly . i guess most of the movies in the series are silly , but this movie is silly even in the confines if the series . for me , it's the worst one of the first 8 . but that's just me . my vote for Friday the 13th Part VIII : Jason takes Manhattan is a
472920	11423174	189070	4.0	the worst of the Scooby Doo movies i have seen so far	for me , this is probably the worst Scooby Doo animated movie i have seen . i found it boring and not that funny compared to other Scooby adventures . the i didn't think the story was very good either . there seemed to be a lot more repetition than in other Scooby movies . there are also a few elements missing from this particular movie ( that i most Scooby Do movies ) and one element that was nothing other than annoying and i really could have done without . those elements are that only Shag and Scoob are in this movie . the rest of Mystery , INC are absent . the element i could have done without is the inclusion of Scrappy Doo , which to me is a pointless character . i had to struggle not turn this movie off before the end . this is the exception with Scooby Doo movies , so far in my experience . for me " Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers " is a
472752	11423174	382932	4.0	i don't see it	i did not like this animated offering from Pixar . i didn't think it was funny , or even amusing . i did however find it loud and boring . i actually couldn't finish watching his thing , i was that bored . i really wanted to like it , but it did nothing for me . although all is not lost , since i now have something to practice skeet shooting with . i don't know why i didn't like this movie . it just didn't seem to have the zip and wit that many Pixar creations have . the physical comedy bits all fell flatter than a pancake for me . maybe i'm just out to lunch with this movie . it wouldn't be the first time , and i'm sure it won't be the last time . oh well . i will say the movie was well made and looked nice , so that's something . for me , Ratatouille is a
473519	11423174	111082	4.0	not that good	this is a B movie , no doubt about it . that isn't always a bad thing . i f you have good acting , decent characters , and a decent storyline , it could work . does this movie have any of that ? maybe a little . the story is mildly interesting . none of the characters are , except for one . that would be the villain , played by Richard Lynch . Lynch has a certain quality about him that makes him watchable . the rest of the characters , i didn't really care one way or another . the reason for that is the suspect acting . the other thing i didn't like ( in fact , it really annoyed me ) was the unbelievably cheesy . sound effects / music that was used every time somebody was being scanned . it drove me up the wall . while this is nowhere near the worst movie i have seen , it is closer to the bottom than the top .
473675	11423174	348060	4.0	pretty weak old style animation	this old style animation movie might be likable by young kids , but that might be a bit of a stretch . it's just too slow , with a story that isn't very strong . plus it tries to be dark at times and lite at others . the amusing bits are overdone , and not really amusing . again , young kids might find these sequences funny . yet the movie is also a bit too dark , in my opinion , for young kids . so it's hard to say who the movie would be suitable for . or maybe i'm just blowing it out of proportion , and young kids would have no problem with it . for me though , i just found the whole thing a bit too weak . my vote for the animated version of The Snow Queen is a
473359	11423174	85959	4.0	very clever and funny , but . . .	most of this movie is very funny . i laughed hard a lot . it's very silly in spots , and some of the songs go on too long , but that wasn't a major issue with me . if you're very religious , you will find a lot of issues with this movie , as the Catholic Church is lambasted mercilessly . again , that wasn't a major issue with me . no , the problem i has with the movie begins with chapter 17 , which is about 65 minutes , i believe . up to that point , i would have given it a pretty high rating . however , it's at this point where the movie becomes sick , to the point where i wanted to throw up . this particular chapter is not funny at all , just disgustingly gross . if you have a weak stomach , you probably won't enjoy chapter 17 , and it may ruin the rest of the movie for you . which is a shame , because , other than that one chapter , it's actually a very clever and funny movie . i would have given it an , but because of needless grossness , i can't give it higher than
473789	11423174	499554	4.0	better than i expected	( this comment refers to the unrated version ) i got this movie really cheap , so i wasn't too worried about how good it was . actually i expected it it be awful , and it really wasn't . there are actually some amusing moments here . the movie is based on the TV show of the same name . i haven't seen the show , but i don't think that matters too much . it sort of reminded me of the Police Academy movies ( although these cops aren't in training , they're just inept ) and Super Troopers . i pretty much hated Super troopers and found the Police Academy movies not that funny . i think Reno 991 Miami is better than both . but if you did like Super Troopers or Police Academy , you should like this movie . it isn't for everyone , though . it's rude crude , lewd , obnoxious , offensive and sexist , and just about anything you can think of . if any of the above don't appeal to you , this is not your movie . even though it was better than i expected , i would give it no more than a
473818	11423174	358349	4.0	strictly cheap laughs and lame story	talk about disappointing . this sequel has none of the heart of the original . the first one was silly , but at least it had a semblance of story , and the laughs were honest . here , it's all about the cheap laughs . this movie is slow and boring , with a lame story . if it didn't go direct to video , it should have . Anthony Anderson is in this one , and he can usually be counted on for some good laughs , but he has nothing to work with here . this is case where they should just have stuck with the original , or at least put some more thought into the sequel . it feels rushed , but then it was , considering it came out merely a year later than the first one . Agent Cody Banks 2 : Destination London gets a from me .
472889	11423174	109551	4.0	middle of the road for this genre	this movie wasn't too too bad , i guess . the premise ? an ancient creature lives beneath the surface of a graveyard , feeding on the freshest bodies . . one man wants it for its remarkable healing properties . believing that humans can benefit from it . another man ( a former F . B . I . agent ) wants to kill it , ostensibly for revenge in the death of his partner . but there is clearly something else driving him . this premise , or a very similar one , was used a few years ago and to much greater effect . Anyway , that is all i will say as far as the plot goes . the movie itself doesn't have much in the way of substance , zero character development , and a " b " movie quality to it . the dialogue is at times pedantic or plain stupid , and delivered in robotic monotones by some of the actors . however this is not the worst of it . the creature itself is very poorly designed . it is evident in more than one scene that it is simply just someone in a big ape-like suit . the monster is not an ape , but this is close of a description as i can come up with . the ending was not consistent with the rest of the movie , and seemed tacked on when they reached the required running time . not the worst movie ever made by any means . just not overly great . Try " Relic " instead .
472542	11423174	181196	4.0	kids might like the action , though it is pretty tame	i wasn't too impressed with this animated spin off of the Toy Story films . i just expected better . the story was pretty weak , but at least there were a few amusing moments . i found it too preachy myself . i like the message it has , about friendship and teamwork , but i just thought it was a bit too unsubtle . kids might like it , considering there was a fair amount of action . there's nothing inappropriate that i saw , so it's probably suitable for most ages . in fact , the movie is pretty tame , with pretty much no violence . anyway , this isn't horrible by any means , it just isn't anything special . for me , Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins is a
473920	11423174	116033	4.0	" Crime has a new enemy and justice has a new face " . . . , ( )	OK , but does that make this a good movie ? well , not really , in my opinion . there isn't a whole lot to recommend it . i found it very slow , tediously , in fact . it's also predictable pretty much through and through . number one and two were somewhat predictable , but not as much . i also felt this movie was quite campy at times , which i didn't really think fits this series and the character . Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment . he's a decent enough actor , but i felt he played his character too over the top . i guess that fit with the tone of the movie , which would have been great if i had liked the movie . plus , there were some pretty bad one liners . Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role , but is given little to work with in this movie . the character has not really evolved , as i had hoped . oh well . this is just my opinion . anyway , for me , while this movie is not abysmal , it is pretty bad . my vote for Darkman III :
472551	11423174	267248	4.0	i found it mostly non-believable , pointless and confusing	mostly i found this movie non-believable , pointless and confusing . i didn't find it really predictable , but most people probably will . the acting was OK , but not great . Zooey Deschanel was the only bright spot , in my opinion . Benjamin Bratt appeared in the movie and was adequate . Katie Holmes was supposed to be the star , i think . i found her sub par , as usual . i don't really like her that much , and have yet to see he in a good movie . or rather i have yet to see her put in a good performance in a movie . the ending was something most people will probably see coming a mile away . it's not something i predicted , but it wasn't surprising either . my vote for Abandon is a
473026	11423174	113253	4.0	updated Friday May 16 . 2008 ) a fairly low point in the series , but the producer's cut ( ) is a whole new movie	to me , this was the worst Halloween movie up to this point . i found the storyline contrived and lame . not to mention , i don't see how it fit in with the Michael Myers mythology up to that point . there's a lot of gaps between the previous film and this one , and none of them are filled in or explained in any satisfying , or even credible way . i get the distinct impression this movie was just made as a cash cow , with not much thought put into it . plus , i feel they overdid some of the death scenes . i don't mean the violence , but more the sounds of the bones breaking and such . the sounds were just way to vivid and crisp , which didn't really fit the series up to that point . it just wasn't necessary . i think it was done for cheap shock value . this movie did nothing to distinguish itself from other slashers . in fact , that is really all this movie was-a run of the mill slasher . for me , Halloween 6 : The Curse of Michael Myers ( the theatrical version ) is a at best . ( Updated Friday May 16 . 2008 ) however , i recently found a copy of the producer's cut , which is , i think the version that was supposed to be released . it was originally entitled The origin of Michael Myers , and it actually explains the origin of his evil . it fills in almost of the gaps missing from the theatrical version , and is actually a much more coherent and better movie . i think the copy i have is a bootleg version , which is all that exists so far , so you can clearly notice the transitions to the additional scenes . the picture quality of theses scenes are usually darker and grainier , and a few look washed out , but it was worth the price for me . just the fact that it put things into context makes up for the lower quality of these scenes . besides , the quality isn't so bad to make it unwatchable . until this version is released commercially , this one is more than acceptable . if you can find , i would recommend it . it's a whole new movie , possibly the 2nd best entry in the series . based on content alone , Halloween 6 : The Origin of Michael Myers is a strong
473169	11423174	98754	4.0	not the 1979 movie , but 3 episodes of the 1990 series	this is the 1990's TV show , not the movie from 1979 . it looks to be three episodes totaling just under 90 minutes . before watching , i thought it was one of the movie versions , and i noticed right away , it had a TV show Feel to it . i didn't care for it too much . i just felt the story wasn't there , and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama . i was looking at the time elapsed on my DVD player frequently , as i was really bored . i also thought some of the dialogue was , to put it politely , not good . plus , i thought the acting left a lot to be desired . but that's just me however , it is good clean , wholesome family entertainment . there's certainly nothing offensive here . kids will likely enjoy it . for me , The Black Stallion is
473019	11423174	98282	4.0	so much potential	this movie had the ingredients to be a very funny comedy . it has Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor , who play a deaf guy and a blind guy , respectfully . a man is shot and killed , and the death guy and the blind guy are the only witnesses . they can't prove anything , so they are arrested for the murder . and they escape custody . sounds like a good and original premise , right ? well it is , but i found that all the jokes fell flat . i was , quite frankly , bored . after about 36 minutes , i had to stop watching . it was just way too slow . maybe you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy this movie . or maybe it's just not my kind of movie . either way , i found it pretty lame . it has a chuckle or two , but not enough to maintain my interest . if you're a Pryor / Wilder fan , you might want to check it out . for me , See no Evil , Hear no Evil is a
473434	11423174	100485	4.0	boring and anti climatic	i was bored throughout this movie . it's slow moving and not much happens . it's not much different than your standard revenge tale . other than it might be more boring than many . Kevin Costner Anthony Quinn and Madeline Stowe star her , but none of them are given a lot to do with their characters . still , i liked Stowe the most . her character is the most interesting . the plot is pretty thin here , and well worn . a lot of the dialogue is clichéd , and predictable , but maybe that's just me . if you're looking for an exciting , action packed movie , this is not it . i had higher expectations for this movie going in , and i was sorely disappointed . for me , Revenge is a
472741	11423174	100502	4.0	i thought it could have been so much better	man this movie has it all , and i don't mane that In good way . i didn't think the acting was very good in this one . i also thought a lot of the humour in it was mean spirited . and don't get me started on the story . i just found it beyond the bounds of reality even for this type of movie . maybe this movie is supposed to be absurd . if so , it succeeded . the thing about the original is it had some heart and soul to it . i didn't see any of that in this one . Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are back for this one , and they try hard , i think , but they don't have too much to work with . on paper , this movie may have looked like it would work , but i think it lost something in the translation . where the first one managed to look like it had a budget of some sort , this one , looks low budget , and not in a good way . i'm sure it's hard to tell , when you're making a movie if it will work or not so i'll give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt . by that , i mean they probably thought they were making a good movie . some people might like it , but i just found it tedious . having said that , this movie is nowhere near the worst movie i have ever seen . it could have been so much better true , but it could have been worse . so , i'll give " RoboCop 2 "
473786	11423174	95924	4.0	this movie barely has a . . . Pulse ( 1988 )	OK , quick synopsis . electricity in people's houses starts going haywire . it starts whispering to people , driving them insane . it then takes over their houses , turning them into death traps and murdering them . notice i said murder , not kill . this is because the deaths are deliberate , not accidental . r-i-i-i-ght . obviously the whole idea is ludicrous . now , the implausibility of the basic premise could be somewhat forgiven if there were any reason or explanation given for what is happening , but alas , there isn't . no attempt is even made to explain the events . they just happen and that is a large problem . even a lame attempt would be better than none . and don't get me started on the ending . oh what the heck . the ending - makes no sense at all . the movie basically just ends . no loose ends are tied up . but there were some positives . the acting was decent , given that the actors had so little to work with . and there were some tense moments . not the worst movie ever made just not a good one . all in all , an empty unsatisfying experience . a low
472759	11423174	107090	4.0	generic crime thriller with out the thrills	to me , this is just a standard suspense thriller / crime drama . although , in reality , it isn't really thrilling or suspenseful . in fact , it could be a TV episode from a crime show . except for the bit of nudity . you have your usual cast of characters , criminals looking for something , murders , witnesses , plot twists that aren't . i like Marlee Matlin and D . B . Sweeney , but i didn't sense any chemistry between them . the story itself is , like i said , fairly generic , and uninvolving , with a few things that don't add up . in other words , logic gaps . to be fair there are a few tense moments , adding up to maybe five minutes or so of the total running time . otherwise , it's slow and yawn inducing . for me , Hear no Evil is a
472969	11423174	113636	4.0	funnier than both 1 and 2 , but don't expect to be scared at all	this installment of the " Leprachaun " franchise is better than the last two . it's still not great , in fact , it's not quite good either . but it does have a much better pace to it . there are a few more funny moments and one almost hysterical sequence . the body count is higher in this one , and Warwick Davis , once again as the Leprachaun , really gets to cut loose at times . there's definitely a higher energy level this time around . the movie is still not scary at all . and once again , the story is not connected to the previous entries , other than having the same psycho Leprechaun trying to get back his gold . this time , the setting is Las Vegas . for me , so this third " Leprechaun " is the best of the series so far .
473820	11423174	280462	4.0	he'll cut more than your hair ( next ? )	this is a hard movie to watch . mainly because it is so slow . if you are expecting action , you won't find it here . what you will find is a character study of sorts . the characters propel movie more than anything else . it's a murder mystery / drama that takes place in Alaska in the dead of winter , when it is cold and dark for 24 hours a day . Malcolm McDowell plays the barber , but he is more than a barber . he puts in a good performance here , and the supporting actors are also good . aside from that , there isn't a lot worth watching the movie for . instead of having an ending of any sort , it just ends . i was just hoping that if nothing else , some loose ends would be tied up . i might have rated the movie bit higher in that case . as it is , i give The Barber a . as an aside , this movie is similar in spirit to Fargo ( though i thought Fargo was a better movie ) , so if you liked that movie , you might want to check out this movie , or vice versa .
472563	11423174	427576	4.0	mostly bland and uninteresting in my opinion	i didn't like this movie . i found it moved at a glacial pace . i also didn't think the acting was all that great . i only liked 2 characters In the whole movie , which is sad , because there are a lot of characters . i liked the character of Philby , played by Clarence Williams III . i also liked Williams himself . i thought he was on of the 2 best actors in the movie . the other character i like was Cassie , played by Nina Siemaszko . I thought Siemaszko also was very good in her role . these 2 characters ( Philby and Cassie ) i found to be interesting . the rest of the characters were either boring or annoying . Kellie Martin plays the lead character , and to me , she was bland . to be honest , most of the movie was uninteresting , in my opinion . it just seems like nothing really happens . i was really just waiting for this movie to be over . this is not the worst movie i have seen ( " Dracula 3000 " holds that distinction so far ) but it was nothing special either . " Mystery Woman : Mystery Weekend " gets from me .
472921	11423174	212720	4.0	pretty good visual style , but not too much else , in my mind	this movie falls into the same category as Blade Runner in my opinion . i mean it looks good visually , but there isn't much substance . i think so much more could have been done with not only the movie in general but also with the characters . speaking of characters , Jude Law's character struck me as just being nonsensical . i also thought movie was way too long , clocking in at nearly 2 and a half hours . think they could have streamlined the script and made it more economical . but that's just me . plus , i was pretty depressed after watching this movie . other than it's visual style , i don't see a lot of merit here . anyway for me , " Artificial Intelligence : AI " gets a
473797	11423174	65874	4.0	for me , it was too slow	this is just my own personal opinion , but i found this movie very slow . there's a lot of drama , but not much action . Gregory peck plays the sheriff of a very sleepy town , where almost nothing happens . then he does something which goes against his morals . he ends up paying for it in the end . Tuesday Weld also stars in the movie . i watched this movie right to the end , though i found it hard to keep going . John Frankenheimer directed the movie , and if you like his style of movie making , you might like this movie . for me , though , i didn't like it that much . i've seen much worse movies , but i didn't feel invested in this movie or the characters . anyway , if you don't mind drama , and aren't concerned about a lot of action , you might like this movie .
472562	11423174	301989	4.0	too muddled for my tastes	i didn't like this movie . to me , it didn't make much sense . it was hard to figure out what was really happening . i also didn't think it was scary . i did however , think it was silly , even absurd , but not in a good way . Radha Mitchell is the main character in the movie , which cam out in 2003 . She was also , coincidently in 2006's " Silent Hill " which i hated . it too i found confusing and pointless . " Visitors " isn't as bad , but i think it is certainly below average . there is just nothing special about it . the script is just too muddled and there are things in the movie which don't need to be there , in my opinion . I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress , if she has more to work with . my vote for " Visitors " is
473248	11423174	452681	4.0	style over substance , and not much originality	this movie is not that great . i found the story too banal ( ordinary ) . there's not much originality here . it's a combination of many other movies . it's equal parts a Christmas Carol , It's a Wonderful Life , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , and Even The Cat in the Hat movie . the movie isn't very funny , but there is a bit of slapstick that works . this movie is , i felt , overly sentimental and preachy . in fact , i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is . now , don't get me wrong . family is very important . i just find that subtlety works best with these movies . this was just way too heavy handed for me . but there is some good news . the movie has a great visual style . i mean , it looks fantastically magical . and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost , the baddie of the piece . he's not really scary , more mildly disconcerting than anything , and even a bit sad . i also like the look they gave him . this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker . anyway , this is a case of style over substance . and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2 , i still don't think it was as good . the negatives just outweigh the positives . for me , The Santa Clause 3 is a
473089	11423174	313043	4.0	annoying lead character ruins the show	for me , this is by far , the weakest entry in the CSI cannon . it's not that the stories are uninteresting . many of them are . most of the characters are done well enough , except for two notable exceptions . the first exception , and this is just my opinion , is the character of Dr . Alexx Woods , the medical examiner , played by Khandi Alexander . i find the character much too weepy , at least in the earlier episodes i have watched that might be different now . i think Khandi Alexander is a good actress , given a weak character to portray . the character with biggest flaw , at leas in my opinion , is Lieutenant Horatio Caine , Played by David Caruso . Caine is the leader of the team . this character is just way too annoying for me . Caine is just a poser to me , with his supposedly thoughtful demeanor at the end of each episode where he looks out at the ocean with this hands on his hips and his cool looking sun glasses on . i also find his speech pattern annoying . this character sinks the whole show and makes it all but unwatchable . this may not bother everybody , but it sure does bother me . in fact , i dislike the character enough that i have not bought any CSI : Miami on DVD , and probably won't . again , this is the character , not the actor . and the character may be different now . i don't have anything against Caruso . this is just my view . for me , CSI : Miami is a
472997	11423174	107254	4.0	part 9 ( )	this ninth movie is in the Friday the 13th series , pretty much ignores the previous ones . sure , it's still Jason , and he still psychopath with a hockey mask . but otherwise there isn't a lot of similarity . for one thing , in this one they offer an explanation for his unstoppable evil . it's an interesting explanation , but it adds things to the lore that were not in the previous movies , except fro a very brief hint in the 6th or 7th one , i can't recall which . anyway , this movie starts off very promising , but loses traction and end up becoming boring save for a few exciting moments . i viewed the unrated version and it's pretty graphic in its violence . i thought this was slightly better than the previous effort , Jason Takes Manhattan , but only slightly . for me , Jason goes to Hell is a
472845	11423174	902272	4.0	disappointing origin story of The Justice League	i may be in the minority her , but i found this animated movie disappointing . it's basically about the origin of The Justice League but i didn't feel it was worthy of an origin story . i also thought it was slow , an i didn't like the story . there isn't a lot of action in this one , and there's no real threat to the world . there is a threat of sorts , but i think it was lame . there isn't much in the way of character development either . i do think the voice talent was right on in this one , though . i felt the characters and their voices really suited each other . i have no idea if this origin story reflects the actual origin from the comic book , since i haven't read the comic . i just know that the movie was lacklustre . for me . Justice League league : The New Frontier is a
472549	11423174	102803	4.0	should be rated at least PG-13	the rating on this movie is on this site . but it's not as good as i had expected or hoped . that rating is about 2 stars too high for me . for one thing , i found it too insubstantial , with a pretty weak story . the potential was there , but it just wasn't realized . there also existed the possibility of some humour in the movie , but that doesn't really develop either . it's also slow , with only intermittent scenes of action . there's almost no character development . as a matter of a fact , there were a few characters that had almost nothing to do . this movie runs about 104 minutes without end credits , but i had to stop it , to break up the monotony . the American and Canadian rating on this movie is PG , but i think it should be at least PG-13 . i think it's a bit too intense for any under 13 , but that's just me . nevertheless , parents should use their discretion . my vote for The Rocketeer is a
473413	11423174	100404	4.0	disappointing murder mystery / courtroom drama , that should have been thrilling or compelling but isn't	In " Presumed Innocent " , Harrison Ford plays deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich , who has been assigned to investigate the murder of a colleague . the hitch is , he had been sleeping with . he digs a bit deeper into the case than someone wants him to and finds himself charged with her murder . i had had the chance to watch this movie several times over the years and never got around to it . finally , i sat down to watch it . i was not impressed . the movie plods along much too slowly . it is not riveting or even compelling but i suck with it . i will give points for the ending though . it is something i did not expect and would have been pretty decent except they dragged it out long . Harrison Ford was convincing in a dramatic role . Bonnie Bedelia was good as the wife , and Raul Julia was very good as Sabich's defence attorney . as for the movie on a whole , it was disappointing . i wish i could give this movie a better rating , but the best i can do is
473354	11423174	327084	4.0	average animated movie , below average animated comedy	i'm a bit surprised at the fairly high rating this movie has ( just over ) the film was hyped so much and heaped with praise . even a good friend of mine told me it was hilarious . imagine my surprise in finding out it is not hilarious at all , barely even comical . there are a couple of " light chuckle " moments , but that's it . i know it is an animated movie and maybe i'm being too sensitive here ( or , maybe i'm just out to lunch ) , but i actually think the movie is mean spirited in some parts . as an animated movie goes it is about average , certainly nothing more . as an animated comedy , it is lower than average . so , i'll give " Over the Hedge "
473153	11423174	331953	4.0	passably entertaining , if you can get past the first 30 min	At first , i didn't like this movie . i just didn't see the point . i mean there was next to no plot . lots of nudity , ( always a good thing ) drunk people doing really silly things . and of course a psycho killer stalking the staff of the island resort where the movie is set . there are lots of crude and raunchy situations , which is not always a bad thing . the movie is basically a parody of your typical slasher flick . the style of the movie ( if you can call it that ) reminded me of the very early Friday the 13th movies and also April fool's Day , though obviously a very different ending . as a parody , the movie does work . i did not find it funny or even humorous in the slightest , although i did find the absurdity of it somewhat amusing . there is not much in the way of acting ability involved or necessary here . however , i do have to single someone out here . that would be Brittany Daniel , who plays Jenny , one of the island staff . This girl definitely has some acting chops and depth . the camera loves her . I know this type of movie is not normally a barometer of acting ability . this case is different , however . the film is worth watching just for Brittany's performance . All she needs is a good script , and she could be a great character actress , similar to Anna Faris . I hope we see in a serious role sometime . anyway , back to the movie . at some point , i did become engrossed in the film , and was curious as to who the killer was . and believe me , there were a lot of suspects . this movie was sort of like a train wreck . i just couldn't stop watching . slightly entertaining , at times , but just barely . there were only 2 reasons to watch this movie . Brittany Daniel , and to find out who the killer was . BTW , for a movie that is just as raunchy and crude , and also hysterically funny , check out Repli-Kate . as for Club Dread - out of 10
473172	11423174	449471	4.0	should have remained buried	i can't think of too much to like about this alleged horror movie . to me , it lacked any real scares . there is a bit of suspense though not very much . the setting has promise : Catacombs beneath the streets of Paris . that's certainly an eerie place to base a horror film . but , for whatever reason , it just didn't work for me . and i gotta say , this thing is predictable almost from the get go , right to the end . it is loud though , with a pumping rock soundtrack throughout the first half . plus , there are a few things that don't make a lot of sense . normally that shouldn't matter in a horror movie . but when it doesn't do its job , you start to nitpick and look for faults . sometimes it's the only way too keep from being completely bored . for me , The Catacombs is a
472617	11423174	102848	4.0	forgettable sequel , although it is louder	the first Scanners may not have been a great movie , but at least it was original . there is no such novelty to this one . the acting is worse , in my opinion , and the story is slower and nothing special . i also didn't like the dialogue . and the special effects are no better than in the original . this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways . the only thing different about it , is that it is loud and chaotic at times . but that doesn't make a good movie . if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting , this could have been a decent movie . i actually couldn't get through it all without fast forwarding through it . to me , this is a forgettable movie , and not much more . despite all that , there are worse movies . being in a generous mood , i'll give Scanners 2 a .
472958	11423174	117942	4.0	same old , same old	i'll start with the positives . i really like the characters that Bruce Campbell and Ernie Hudson played . they were both very likable . Bruce Campbell did a very good job in his role as a storm chaser . not once did i think of him in his Evil Dead persona . Ernie Hudson was also credible in his role as a scientist who had been trying for years to perfect an early warning system he had developed . other than that , there is not a lot to recommend this movie . we see very few tornadoes in the movie . it is more of a drama than anything else . it was boring at times , to say the least . of far as these types of movies go , this one is very low key and sedate at times . there is also nothing original in it . you basically have the same bunch of characters , just with different names . it passes the time , but that's about it .
473532	11423174	183649	4.0	too rushed , unlikable main character	this movie just didn't do it for me . it's supposed to be thrilling and suspenseful , but i found it to be neither . i can't put my finger on it why it didn't work for me , it just didn't . as you can probably tell from the title , the focus of the movie is a phone booth , and that's where most of the movie takes place . not only did i not like the movie very much , it was also way too short ( 81 minutes ) . the fact that most of the movie takes place in a phone booth isn't the problem . like i said , there's nothing tangible i can point to . this is one movie that is a mystery to me . i don't think there's anything wrong with the direction by Joel Schumacher , either . Larry Cohen wrote the script , and that's not the problem . maybe the problem is that the main character isn't very likable and the movie feels too rushed . either way , i'll give Phone Booth a
473306	11423174	119484	4.0	i wasn't too impressed with this	i wasn't too impressed with this movie . it is in the style of both the Conan movies , but i didn't like it anywhere near as much . there was lots of action , but i still found it to be slow and boring . it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on , but barely . i didn't find the acting very good , although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character . but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen . however , the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie . he doesn't show up until about halfway through , but i liked him in his role . otherwise , the movie is tedious and very hard to get through . for me , Kull the Conqueror is a .
473119	11423174	473553	4.0	not your Father's tooth fairy	this movie is similar to Darkness Falls , and The Boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either . it's also slow and fairly predictable . it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror . plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon . really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that , there is some really awful clichéd dialogue . and i won't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean . there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake . it just wasn't necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good . my verdict for The Tooth fairy :
473688	11423174	71455	4.0	not so good	i was none to impressed with this effort in the disaster genre . i found it too way too long to get going , and was boring . i also didn't think the earthquake sequence was that spectacular . it just wasn't that exciting , nor did it look very realistic , even by the standards of that era ( 1974 . ) i have seen other movies of the genre made around that time period , which are much more realistic . the dialogue left a lot to be desired in my opinion . i felt a lot of it was cringe-worthy . the acting was also bad , but at least it was consistent with the rest of the film . i've seen quite a few disaster movies , and while this one is not the worst , it definitely ranks closer to the bottom of the list for me . i give Earthquake a
473432	11423174	498353	4.0	certainly a step ( or three ) above part I	i hated the original Hostel with a passion . so i was surprised that i didn't hate part 2 . the story is pretty much the same , with mostly different characters , so of course it's predictable . i didn't find it as sick a the first one . as a matter of fact there are only one or two gory scenes . the first 50 minutes or so are all about the setup just like the first one . , so it's kinda boring . there are a few ludicrous moments , including the ending , which ( even though it's ridiculous ) most people will see coming a mile away . and i do love the irony of it . this movie is certainly a step ( or three ) above Hostel I . it's watchable , unlike the first . nevertheless , i would not call this great film making , by any stretch . for me , Hostel II is a
473803	11423174	36241	4.0	Jane Russel's first movie	this thing is all over the place . it's disjointed , and there doesn't seem to be a point to a lot of it . probably most largely remembered as Jane Russel's first movie role , even though she didn't have that big a part . anyway , this thing just goes on and on and on . there were times i was sure it was over , and it could have been , but it kept going . it also plays fast and loose with history , as far as i know . Doc Holiday , Pat Garret and Billy the Kid are all in this one . i don't just mean they're in the same movie . they're actually together in most scenes of the movie . for me , when you add everything all up , this is a bizarre mess . i give The Outlaw a
472627	11423174	988047	4.0	underwhelming	talk about high hopes being dashed . seeing the trailers for this film starring Don Cheadle , i was convinced it would be a great movie . sadly , i found it boring , predictable , muddled , pointless . I like Don Cheadle a lot . but i think he made a bad decision to star in this movie . Guy Pierce , Neil McDonough , and Jeff Daniels co star . a case of a great cast being wasted , except for guy Pierce , who i was impressed with . otherwise , this movie is just filled with despair and no hope . it's got a fairly high rating of , which i would say is way , way too generous . maybe i just wasn't in the right mood or frame of mind for this movie . anyway , for me , Traitor is a
473074	11423174	490798	4.0	i wasn't too impressed with this	i found this movie to be mostly a P . O . S . it was low budget , but that isn't the problem . the problem is , the movie is just lame . it doesn't really make a lot of sense . yes , it does explain why things happened , but that's not what i mean . there was just no reason for it all . the movie also moved very slow . the last ice age was quicker than this . also , i think they went overboard a bit in the kills . i don't mean they were too gross , but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head , or stabbing his victim . maybe i'm being petty , but i just didn't like the movie . the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of " When a Stranger Calls " and maybe that was the whole point . but so what . for me " When A Stranger Kills " is a
472554	11423174	88936	4.0	not one of Chuck's best	in fact , it's your typical action / crime drama . the characters are stereotypical for this genre . i also found the movie slow and depressing . i was quite disappointed . i was expecting a much better movie than this . the action is slow , and there really isn't much originality here . Andrew Davis directed this one . he also directed The Fugitive , Under Siege and Above the Law , all after Code of Silence . but it's not all bad . for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys , although he doesn't get a lot of screen time . because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a
473773	11423174	96754	4.0	didn't live up to the potential	i don't think this was a good film . first off , i just found it so tediously slow . it never really picked up much at all . when it gets to the " reveal " of some undersea life , it redeems itself somewhat , but not much . though i will say the special effects were pretty impressive in this regard . the problem is , we are not shown as many creatures as i would have liked . and for me , the whole movie hinges on that aspect . beyond that , there isn't a lot i liked about the movie . the acting was adequate , but nothing more . the movie is also way too long , in my opinion . i unfortunately watched the extended version , which clocks in at about 170 minutes , while the original theatrical cut was only 140 minutes . anyway , when you put it all together , the most i can give The Abyss is a .
472714	11423174	102202	4.0	not as good as number 1 , ( or 2 and 3 , for that matter )	this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original . there is lots of blood in this one , courtesy of the fight scenes . , which is a good thing . the fight scenes themselves aren't too bad . however , if found the plot to be lame and uninteresting . this martial arts movie did not really engage my interest very much . this movie lacks the depth ( i , i said depth and martial arts movie in the same sentence ) of the first film and even the following two sequels . the worst part of the experience is the song selections and choice of band . who picks this crap . these guy don't even rate as flea bag bar band . and the songs are pathetic . the only good things in this movie are Sasha Mitchell , who makes a credible hero and Dennis Chan , who plays the wise oriental sidekick . i suppose i could eke out a for this movie , since it is watchable , but the music just sucks so damn bad , i have to give " Kickboxer 2 "
472816	11423174	234215	4.0	random and incoherent	this is the second movie in the Matrix saga . it chronicles the continuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuing enslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them . this is not what i would call good movie . it is a collection of repetitive and ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes , coupled with an incoherent storyline . plus there a lot of " profound ' sayings which aren't really profound at all . then you have characters speaking in riddles which are gibberish half the time . at time , i felt i was being preached a philosophy lesson . the rating for this movie is pretty high on this site ( ) which astounds me . in my opinion , that is at least three stars too many . My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a
472586	11423174	117723	4.0	not too good ( especially if you expect to laugh )	this movie is billed as a spoof / comedy , but it's not really funny . there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments , but mostly it's just silly , without being funny . this movie would work as an actual spy movie , except that you have the expectation that you will laugh . it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here , but i'll try . i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs . sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake . so the movie isn't really funny , but it does have 1 redeeming feature . that is the casting of Andy Griffith ( TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show ) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it . Griffith is great in this movie . he has so much fun in the role . Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief . but overall , the movie is not good . the most i can squeeze out for " Spy Hard " is a
472615	11423174	82497	4.0	interesting concept , but the movie is not interesting	this movie kinda reminded me of the classic short story The Monkey's Paw , only it isn't as good . it's too long for one thing , and too slow . the concept is interesting , but to me the execution of it goes wrong somewhere . i did find it interesting that Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay and directed the movie . there is nothing political about the movie . this doesn't mean the movie is good of course , but it is an interesting aside , nonetheless . Michael Caine is the lead , and and does an OK job , but the material is not really compelling or even mildly interesting . i watched it for awhile and got bored , so i started talking on the phone with a friend while i continued watching halfheartedly . having said all that , i don't think it is an awful movie , it's just not very interesting . by the way , this movie is part of the Twisted terror Collection , and is also contained in the box set ( along with five other titles ) of the same name . anyway , my vote for the hand is a
472607	11423174	298130	4.0	underwhelming	i may be in the minority here , but i just didn't find the Ring to be a good movie . for me , it's not much different the the Grudge . i will say , i liked it a bit more than The Grudge , only because it isn't so annoying . there are a few differences between the two movies , but in my mind , it's almost the same movie . i do remember being bored and struggling to not nod off . i just didn't see any excitement anywhere in the movie , but that's just me . Naomi Watts is in it , and she's not bad , considering what she has to work with . but once again , the ghost is not scary , although it does look a bit creepy , i guess , vaguely . i didn't feel any suspense either . but if you liked The Grudge , then you might like The Ring . or you might want to check out The Messengers ( which i liked ) and Pulse , ( 2006 ) ( which i liked ) which are sort of similar but better in my opinion . as for The Ring , i give it
472631	11423174	345074	4.0	not really suited to my tastes	this movie isn't for me , but i could see how people would like it . it has two very likable leads in Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette . both are great actresses and work well off each other very well here . they both have great comedic timing . and their are some great witty moments here . but for me , there's just too many musicals , and i'm not really a musical fan . plus , i kinda found the film quite slow . i'm not really into the drag queen scene in movies either . i knew what the movie was about before watching it but i still thought id ' give it a shot . if you're a musical fan and you have a bit of patience , this movie might work for , and you might really enjoy it . my vote for Connie and Carla is a
473173	11423174	119709	4.0	most ( ly ) dull	this movie was pretty much one big bore . it's about a political / military cover up . many other movies have dealt with the same subject , and much better . Keenan Ivory is OK in the lead role , but i didn't Buy John Voigt as a corrupt general . Paul Sorvino , Eric Roberts and Jill Hennessey are all good , but they all have too little screen time . there isn't much in the way of tension here , and given the situation there should be . there is one ridiculous multi vehicle accident that has no logic . at least i don't think it did . if you really wanna see this movie , your best bet would be on premium cable or a cheap rental . but that's just me . for me , Most Wanted is
473117	11423174	96320	4.0	clever premise , but doesn't live up to its potential	the premise for this movie is clever and original . Two men who do not look alike and are totally different human beings find out they are twins . one is a perfect physical specimen , very well educated and honest . and he grew up on a deserted island . the other one-well lets just say he's almost the exact opposite . Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Danny Devito are the twins . so the movie should be hilarious . but it's not . at least i didn't think so . there are a few amusing lines , but that's about it . the whole " fish out of water " scenario should be funny , but again , it isn't . there is another plot which is basically a crime drama and that's what this this movie feels like to me , a crime drama . i got bored about halfway through and had to turn it off for awhile before going back to it . for me , Twins is a
473219	11423174	291502	4.0	not quite awful , just slow and not very interesting	i don't think this movie is as awful as everyone says . i think it's mildly amusing . bu ti don't think it's very interesting , and it is slow . ti don't think the acting is the problem . i think it's the script . i think it's a movie with an identity crises . i'm just not sure what kind of movie it wants to be . i don't think the dialogue is very good either . having said that , i will say i think the acting is not that great . it's average at best . no one really seemed interested to be there . but they don't really have a lot to work with . Madonna is in this movie and i don't think her acting is any better or worse than anyone else in the movie . for me , Swept away rates a
473467	11423174	324554	4.0	could have been very good , but bad writing gets in the way	Wicker Park is a movie that starts out promising , but ends up becoming a convoluted mess . the actors all do fine jobs with what they are given , but the writing sinks the film . the movie has some degree of realism and logic in the earlier stages but then quickly bogs down in one implausible scenario after another . the movie is a suspense thriller and it does deliver on that count , but who cares , if you can't follow the movie . if you are left scratching your head at the absurdity of it all , the movie loses its initial appeal . wicker park won't be the worst movie you've ever seen , by a long shot . but it will end up hurting your brain trying to decipher , who's doing what to who , and why . this movie had so much promise , and with a better script , who knows how much better it could have been . instead of being above average , the movie is choked by mediocre writing and ultimately fails .
472728	11423174	67341	4.0	. . . . and while we're at it , let's bore everyone else to death	the thing about this movie is for the better part of it , next to nothing happens . this is one sublime movie . i wouldn't say it's a bad movie , but if you are looking for action , you will have to look elsewhere . to be fair , most movies of the 70's are much slower , or seem to be , compared to today's films . there is a plot in the movie , but it takes a long while to unfold . even so , it's not hard to see where the movie is headed long before it gets there . there is an eerie atmosphere about the movie , i'll give it that much . and there is one scene which definitely amps up the creepiness factor . it is similar to " Rosemary's Baby " in its glacial pace , but it is a better movie . the ending does wrap things up , if you pay attention , but you do kind of have to think about it to make the connection with the rest of the movie . if you like old fashioned ghost stories that take awhile to unfold , you'll like this movie . for myself , i found it much too slow . Let's Scare Jessica to Death is a
473058	11423174	92632	4.0	too long of a buildup to nothing	i guess this movie is a bit eerie at times . it's basically about people who practice an obscure religion , with bizarre beliefs . but i've seen at least one movie quite similar to it , possibly more . so not only is there not much originality , but nothing new is done with the material . plus i pretty much figured things out from the get go . the whole movie is basically one slow build . but to what , i'm not sure . i mean there is a bit of excitement in the last 25 minutes or so . but the ending is very predictable . generally i found this movie too boring to watch right through . i had to stop it several times , and then try to continue . actually i completely stopped it at one point , until this morning , when i finally finished it . some people will like this movie , and some will not . i fall into the category of not , for the most part . the acting was good though , so that's always a bonus . even so , i give The Believers a
473828	11423174	120534	5.0	much too slow , but could be a lot worse	while i didn't hate this movie , i didn't find it spectacular either . the first twenty minutes or so are quite good , with some action and tension . the last ten minutes are also good , again with some action and suspense . the problem is the middle of the movie . it's just too damn slow moving . i kept hoping and waiting for something to happen . there's a lot of talking in this one . however , i really liked Graham Greene as a bitter former cop . Madchen Amick is convincing in the role of action heroine by the way , is it just me , or could she pass for Kim Delaney's twin sister ? anyway , the star of this movie is Adrian Pasdar , who plays the bad guy , and really well , i might add . his character is definitely very chilling and sadistic . unfortunately , the the movie itself falls short . my vote for " Wounded " is
473031	11423174	493327	5.0	check out the mini-series The Grid , for a better treatment of the subject of terrorism	i was disappointed din this terrorism suspense thriller , mainly because i didn't feel there was much in in the way of suspense or thrills . it just sort of plods along for about 160 minutes or so . i didn't care for the characters , except one , the character played by Blair Underwood . i found his character interesting . unfortunately , he doesn't have a lot of screen time . and for me , most of the actors didn't fit their roles . at least i didn't buy it . if you're looking for a movie dealing with terrorism that is exciting , riveting and tense , you should check out the mini series , The Gris , which i thought was outstanding . it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time . my vote for Covert One : The Hades Factor is a at best .
473111	11423174	318497	5.0	OK for the genre	this movie is OK for the horror genre . it's nothing new or special , but the genre has produced worse . i didn't find the acting all that bad . again , it wasn't great , but i've seen worse . Paris Hilton is in this one , and is no better or worse than anyone else in the movie . i didn't find the movie particularly scary or thrilling . but then a lot of so called horror movies aren't scary , merely disgusting . but i did think it was passable entertainment for 85 minutes or so . if you go in expecting award winning acting , and anything but a time waster , you'll be disappointed . if you've never seen one of these types of movies , you might find it scary . otherwise , just enjoy watching characters doing the stupid things they do in these movies before getting dispatched . for me , Nine Lives is a
472639	11423174	105112	5.0	i found it pretty boring and slow , for the most part	i won't say this is a horrible film , because it isn't . i just found it boring for the most part . there are a few tense moments , and there is a bit of action . this movie is more of a drama than anything , in my mind . it's a Jack Ryan movie , with Harrison Ford playing Ryan . it's based on the novel by Tom Clancy . the acting is good , and the characters are okay , just don't expect too much character development in this one . anyway , for whatever reason , i just didn't find this movie very compelling . i don't think it translated too well from the page to the screen . it will be quite awhile before i watch it again . i have seen a lot worse , but i've also seen a lot better . my vote for " Patriot Games " :
472544	11423174	1059793	5.0	good for the kids , but has some scary looking characters	i don't quite no what to make of this film . this is Garfield's first CG animated movie . i thought it had some amusing moments , but nothing laugh out loud funny . the story is very simple , so kids will be able to follow it very easily . the voices were very fitting for the characters . the CG in general looks nice and pretty . that's the good news . the bad news ? some of the characters look quite freaky , almost scary , i think . . i also found the movie very slow for much of the time . i realise i'm much older than the target audience . for kids , if they don't find some of the characters too creepy , they will probably enjoy it . adults might like it too , and if not , at least they know their kids are watching kid friendly entertainment . for me , i give Garfield Gets Real a
472522	11423174	105128	5.0	a inferior sequel that is much too slick for its own good	Pet Semetary 2 is not as creepy as Pet Semetery . it is however , gorier and faster paced . there is also more character development in this one , so theoretically you should feel more emotionally for the characters , but i didn't . perhaps that may be because they are all shallow and unlikable . this movie was played more for camp value , than anything else . the acting is very hammy in some scenes , i hope intentionally . there is also an attempt at shock value , but it is more disgust i felt than shock in some scenes . this movie also has none of the atmosphere or mystique of the first . it is much too slick feeling . i felt the first had a sort of rough , raw quality , which works . the slickness of this movie is one of its failings , along with some others i mentioned . bottom line . this movie is inferior to the original .
473925	11423174	382625	5.0	underwhelming	after watching this movie , i have one overriding feeling . that of being underwhelmed . there was lot of hype for this movie , but it just didn't live up to it for me . it should have been better . i mean , it had good actors and a decent story . and the dialogue was OK . but . for whatever reason , it just didn't resonate with me . i guess the biggest reason is that i found it slow and boring . i found the end way too protracted fro my tastes . i also believe they could have shaved 30 minutes off of it . i also think Tom Hanks's character was too low key In this movie . for another ' quest ' movie , i would recommend National Treasure . it's not as deep , but i felt it was much more fun and action packed . but that's just my opinion . for me , The Da Vinci Code is a .
472922	11423174	83658	5.0	disappointing to me	i'm afraid i have to disagree with the high rating this film has ( ) i found it tortuously slow and i couldn't finish watching , though i tried hard . so many people rave about this film , and i'm at a loss to explain . yes , it is very stylish . it has a very atmospheric dark mood to it . it's also pretty creative , i guess , or it was for that time . but the problem i have with the movie is the action is much too sublime for my tates . i need a bit more happening in the movie i watch . or at least more compelling dialogue . i didn't think the screenplay was all that great either . so when you you add all this up , you're left with one big yawn fest . this is just my opinion , of course , and i wouldn't say it's a bad movie . i do think it's overrated though . . Ridley Scott is apparently going to release a definitive version of the film i the not too distant future , so that may be a better version . as for this film as it stands , i can only give " Blade Runner " a , mainly due to its style .
473416	11423174	345852	5.0	an eerie ghost story that is very slow at times ( only those with patience should watch ) but with an ending that some may find unpredictable	" Red Rover " also called " The Haunting Within " , is an eerie ghost story . it is beautifully photographed with a haunting Celtic soundtrack . the acting is certainly good , and the the movie is very stylish . However it is almost painfully slow at times and sometimes plot is real hard to make sense of . there are a few creepy moments and i was reminded more than once of the movie " Hide and Seek " with Robert Deniro and Dakota Fanning problem is , there are fewer of these eerie creepy scenes than there should be so you will need lots of patience to get through this one . Another reviewer does mention the Changeling , the 1980 horror film , starring George C . Scott and Red Rover definitely does echo that movie heavily . both movies are also very slow at times . so this movie is not entirely original and is almost anti climatic . however the ending was a twist which i did not see coming ( though many people likely would have ) , so that was pleasant surprise . if you don't mind a slow buildup towards an ending that is very subdued ( as is the whole movie ) you might like this one . for me , i don't think i could sit through it again . the music and the picturesque beauty of the film do elevate it a bit , so i would give it
472571	11423174	72653	5.0	western / comedy with Don Knotts , Tim Conway and Bill Bixby	this western / comedy starring Don Knotts , Tim Conway , and Bill Bixby is a movie the whole family can watch . there's nothing offensive that i noticed . the thing is , though , the movie is not all that great . sure , it does have a few comedic moments ( courtesy of Knotts and Conway ) , which provide some lite chuckles . but nothing great . the story is decent enough , though pretty unoriginal , and predictable . and most of the movie is slow , and maybe a bit too long . but if you go in to it with low expectations , you might actually enjoy it . i found myself mildly amused and entertained . for a lazy Sunday , you could do worse . for me , The Apple Dumpling Gang is a
473805	11423174	288384	5.0	real court cases with actors portraying the actual people	billed s an early example of reality TV , this series presents 25 minute ( or so ) episode of ' real court cases ' but with actors portraying the real people . and of course most , if not all of the names have been changed to protect the individual . the character of the judge is always the same , played by the same actor . some of the episodes are humorous , some are bizarre . the acting isn't that great , and i have hard time believing that a real judge would behave as unprofessionally as this one does in some of the episodes . it's not a classic show , by any means still , the show is mildly amusing , and interesting for it's historical value . for me , Night Court U : S : A : is a
473875	11423174	126388	5.0	better than i expected or hoped	for a Van Damme movie , this isn't half bad . there's some pretty good action sequences , and the dramatic scenes aren't too shabby either . it's not a great film , by any stretch , but it is almost good . too bad the general premise is fairly weak and unoriginal , though i admit there were some details that were a bit different . i will admit that i actually cared about the characters , or some of them , anyway . maybe i'm becoming soft . there is a more human element to this film than many of Van Damme's efforts . i was really impressed by Van Damme's flawless French accent . oh . wait , that's his real accent . oh , well , at least his character and his accent fit together for once . also , the movie ended differently than i expected , in a good way . overall , not too bad an effort . better than " The Quest " , which is my least favourite Van Damme film so far . for me , " Legionnaire " is a
472784	11423174	453556	5.0	disappointing , to say the least	this is the first CG animated adventure of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . i had fairly high hopes for this movie . unfortunately , it didn't live up to them . i found the story lacking and uninteresting . plus , it just moves too slow . i didn't find the action scenes very good either . honestly , i just didn't thin the movie was worthy of the characters . it's CG animated , so it looks really nice . the voice actors were good . but the rest of the movie was lacking . i just was not engaged at all . maybe i just expected too much given the history of the characters . even though i didn't like the movie too much , i wouldn't call it horrible and there are a lot of worse movies out there , most of which i have seen . in my opinion , TMNT is a
472956	11423174	325234	5.0	' mockumentary ' on parking enforcers	here we have a ' mockumentary ' ( fake documentary ) on the people who enforce the parking laws . you know who i mean . you leave your car , and come back to it , only to find that nice little piece of paper on it . you know the 1 that says you have to pay a fine because you parked 30 seconds too long at the metre , or you parked half an inch to far from the curb . well the movie is about the people who put those nice pieces of paper on the windshield , i person in particular . this person's name is Grant , and Grant is of the opinion that his job is very important . it is a public service , and to hear him talk about it , akin to curing disease . they even have a ' guru'of parking enforcement named Murray which they revere very highly , like a god . they even spout philosophical drivel from the man himself . this movie should be funny , but it isn't . it is mildly amusing ( and i do mean mildly ) at best . there is nothing profound in this movie , that i can see . i wouldn't recommend renting it , but if you see it on TV , and you have nothing else to do , it will serve as a diversion for around 90 minutes . it is less than 90 minutes , and it does go by quickly , so that is a plus . others may find some this movie hysterical and even ' deep'but for me , it is average entertainment at best . ' my vote for ' The Delicate art of Parking ' ?
473366	11423174	38926	5.0	three of six in the series	this is the third of six movies in the Shadow series of movies , and the first of three starring Kane Richmond as Lamont Cranston / The Shadow . Cranston is played in this one as more of a flippant smart alec . he is the nemesis of the chief of police , who resents him butting in on his cases . this one has a darker tone than the firs two ( The shadow Strikes , and International Crime ) . the story is fleshed out a bit more here , and there is more action . minor spoilerThe Shadow is actually a suspect in this mystery . Shrevvy ( Tom Dugan ) Cranston's trusty cabbie and helper ) has a bigger role to play in this one , and it's funny to see him mangle some of his words . this movie does have its slow spots and does seem dragged out at times , but overall , it was enjoyable . my vote for The Shadow Returns is a 5 / / 10
473926	11423174	470055	5.0	it was a bit different than the first one , but i didn't find it any better or worse	after watching this sequel ( which has nothing to do with the first ) to the first Open Water , i'm not sure what to think . like the first movie , this one also has the ' based on true events ' . and again i think it is plausible that events happened the way the movie shows . either way , i liked some things about , the movie but some things i didn't like . i liked the fact that we get into the meat of the story quicker this time . also , although this one also involves people being left adrift out at sea , the circumstances which lead up to things are different . there are also more people involved . to me , the acting didn't really stand out , with one exception . that would be Susan May Pratt . i found her very believable as someone who was distraught over what had happened . anyway , this time , there are six friends involved . this makes for an interesting dynamic and some genuine tension . you also don't know who , if anyone will survive . those are the good things about it . as for what i didn't like , i thought the movie dragged a bit at times . it is about 15 minutes longer , which i felt was too long . i'm gonna give Open water 2 : Adrift the same rating as the first Open Water , which would be
473678	11423174	398808	5.0	less of the fantasy element than i'd hoped for ( and not a movie for young kids )	i was disappointed in this movie . it thought there would be more of a fantasy element to it , but that was just a very small part of the movie . most of the movie was nothing spectacular , with very little story or character development . i just felt they could have done more with the material . that's not to say that it's bad movie , because it isn't . the movie takes a dark turn towards the latter half , and becomes heartbreaking . i don't think it would be suitable for really young kids , because there are some pretty serious themes to it , and because it takes such a dark turn . there's nothing really offensive though , but parents should really use their discretion . for me , i give Bridge to Terabithia a
472596	11423174	120331	5.0	average low budget disaster movie	i just couldn't get all that excited about this movie . i mean , there are a few scenes of tidal waves , which look okay , i guess , but not spectacular . to me , , the parts of the movie involving the 2 main characters , seemed like an episode of moonlighting , more than anything else . and overall , the movie is the 2 characters trying to solve a mystery . there is an interesting angle in the movie , which i won't give away here . and as i mentioned earlier in a comment on'Killer Flood : the Day the Damn Broke ' , i had just watched 2 big budget disaster movies , ' 10 . 5'and its sequel ' 10 . 5 : Apocalypse , which are to me , the best disaster movies i have seen so far . i guess ' Tidal Wave . No Escape ' , is about average , so is my rating
473833	11423174	338013	5.0	not a horrible movie , but much too methodical for my tastes	this is a hard movie to review . i mean , it has a unique premise : that it is possible to erase selected memories from your mind , so you can forget any heartache and pain . that's sort of the gist , but things don't actually work out quite that way for the characters involved . aside from the unique premise , i found the movie hard to follow and much to slow and melancholy . it's also much too methodical for my tastes . it seems to dwell too long on certain scenes or situations . the movie is also very bizarre at times . this is no summer popcorn movie . it's definitely deep . too deep for me . i guess it's sort of a lesson that there's just some things you shouldn't mess with as there may be unexpected repercussions . i found the movie on the cusp of being compelling , just enough to keep watching to the end . the acting in the movie is good . Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play the two lead characters . the supporting cast is also strong . this movie won't make you feel uplifted , so if you're feeling down , you might want to hold off on this movie . all things considered , the most i can give " eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " is a
472868	11423174	59221	5.0	meek typesetter ( Don Knotts ) for small newspaper spends night in haunted house	this film is a bout a meek typesetter who works in the basement of a small newspaper in a small Kansas town . he aspires to be an ace reporter for the paper . as luck would have it , he given the chance . all he has to do is spend the night in a reputed haunted house and write an article for the paper describing all the ghostly occurrences which happen in the house , anything that might give credence to the house being haunted . this is the basic gist of the movie . Don Knotts plays Luther Heggs , the meek typesetter with big dreams . the movie was mad in 1966 and is perfect viewing for anyone who may be easily offended , there is nothing even remotely offensive here . this is safe family viewing , very sanitized . for many people it will be more than a bit sugary , otherwise harmless entertainment . i found it mildly amusing at best , so i'd have to give it
472843	11423174	212346	5.0	watchable mostly for Michael Caine's performance	this Sandra Bullock vehicle is watchable , and has some amusing moments . most of those amusing moments come from Michael Caine , with a few laughs from William Shatner . the plot is simple . Federal Agent Gracie Hart ( Sandra Bullock ) has to go undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States beauty pageant as her latest assignment . i won't give away the reason for this particular assignment . but i will say that Gracie is a tom boy with no idea of how to be a pageant contestant . the words couth or grace , or elegance are not a part of her vocabulary . this is where . Victor Melling ( Michael Caine ) comes in . it's his job to mold Gracie into someone resembling a pageant contestant . Caine gets the most laughs for the whole movie . other than him and William Shatner , the movie is nothing special . for me , Miss Congeniality is a
473899	11423174	120794	5.0	not that great	i was not too impressed with this movie . i found it boring and slow paced , for the most part . then just when it picks up momentum , a song starts up and slow everything down . there were just too many songs for my taste and i found some of the songs nonsensical . the animation is as good as many animated features , although there is one CG sequence which is very impressive . the movie depicts the Exodus of the Israelis from Egypt . there are some liberties taken , but there is a disclaimer at the very beginning that states this , so at least they are honest about that . i found the movie emotionally manipulative at times , so that was a bit annoying . anyway , for me , The Prince of Egypt is a
472755	11423174	479968	5.0	unless you're really bored , i wouldn't bother to pick up	to me , this movie is not great . the premise is of course , absurd , but i knew that going in , so that's not really the problem . the problem is , the movie itself doesn't generate much in the way of suspense or thrills . there's a subplot thrown in that doesn't really have a point . Shannon Sossamon is OK in her role , but not great . however , i didn't buy Ed Burns in his role as a cop , in the slightest . Margaret Cho has what amounts to a cameo as a cop . thankfully it was just a cameo , because i think she was miscast . i also thought the ending was a bit too anti climatic . actually the whole movie was anti climatic . if you just want to kill some time an a lazy afternoon , when you have nothing else to do , it's ' alright . otherwise , though , it's nothing special . not terrible , but not really good either . for me , One Missed Call is a
473009	11423174	45888	5.0	it was OK	this film is inspired by 1933's The Mystery of The House of Wax . many scenes are identical and some of the dialogue is verbatim , but this version is much more fleshed out , both story wise , and character wise . it's also on a grander scale . however , for me , most of the characters were not that interesting , and there were no real standout performances as there were in original version . there was more excitement and suspense in this one , though . unfortunately in my mind , there are a few scenes of filler , or at least what seems like filler to me . one unfortunate aspect of this version is that it was filmed in 3D , but the DVD version is not , so in some scenes , it's clear they existed for the 3D value , but have little point here . i didn't find it scary , but it certainly was macabre and morbid . all in all , not a bad movie , but not quite as good as its inspiration .
473729	11423174	281919	5.0	it didn't really do it for me	this movie didn't really do it for me . i didn't find it very exciting , nor very gory . the killer , in my mind is not that original . there is some gratuitous nudity in 1 scene , but for me , that isn't enough reason to like the movie . the ending kinda surprised me , although it probably shouldn't have . most people who watch this movie will probably figure out the ending long before . if you're into hi tech things , like programing video games , and if you like playing interactive games , with blood and guts , you might like this movie . there is some gore alright , but it's computer gore , which doesn't do it for me . i thought the movie was watchable , but average . i won't give the plot , because i already sort of hinted at it . it's not really original , but that doesn't really matter . to me , it's what's done with the material that's important . anyway , some people will love this game and others will hate it . some people like me , will be somewhere in the middle . i didn't love it or hate it . i just found it average . but that's just me . for me , " How to Make a Monster " is
472862	11423174	292506	5.0	average , cookie cutter action / suspense / pseudo espionage movie	the recruit is an okay movie , i guess . certainly nothing spectacular . there are some suspenseful moments in the movie . however the plot was much too complicated to the point of absurdity . this movie felt like it should have been released directly to video . it was your run of the mill action / suspense movie , ( with some espionage ) with nothing new or original . the suspenseful moments had all been done before , as good or better . the acting was okay , at best , given what the actors had to work with . the dialogue would not win any awards , and the screenplay was basically a knock off of many other , superior movies . truth be told , there wasn't really any reason to make this movie and so i can't give it a glowing recommendation . at best
473199	11423174	68575	5.0	interesting for awhile , but moves too slow	you know , i kinda liked this movie . i mean , it's definitely well made . it's interesting , for awhile . the problem is that it just moves too slow , and after awhile i had to stop watching . it stars Stacy Keach as a washed ex-pro fighter . he meets Ernie Munger ( a young Jeff Bridges ) at a local Y , hitting the boxing bag . the two spar together . eventually , Tully ( Keach ) takes takes Ernie under his wing and teaches him to become a good boxer . he also decides to get back in the ring himself . i didn't get that far ( i lasted about 50 minutes ) but i read it on the cover . anyway , if you have a lot of patience , you might want to give this one a try . for me , though , i just couldn't sit through it . my vote for Fat City :
472612	11423174	103268	5.0	two ghost tales . one good , one not	this movie is basically about two brothers and their cousin who decide to scare each other by telling each other spooky urban legends while camping out . i guess you could compare it the TV shows Goosebumps or Are You Afraid of the Dark , although it's not as good as either of those two . anyway , what follows are two separate tales . the first one is pretty good . it's sort of a black comedy . it is quite amusing , and compelling . plus , it is well written . the second of the tales is not so good . much of the odd behaviour and events are given no reason or explanation . also this tale is boring and feels way too long . the ending makes no sense and doesn't tie into the rest of the story . long story short , the first tale is good-second one-not so much . for me , this movie is a
473435	11423174	91637	5.0	no real excitement either ( )	i wanted to like this movie , but i just couldn't . it'a a formulaic crime dram , but that isn't the problem . the problem is , it's slow and unexciting for the most part . it has a few good moments , but those are few and far between . i felt like i was waiting for ever for something to happen . Richard Gere stars with Kim Basinger . Geer was decent , but not fantastic , and i was not at all impressed with Basinger in this particular movie . there's a also a romance angle that i didn't find convincing or interesting . i won't say who the characters involved are , but i felt zero chemistry between the actors , which is sorta important for any romance aspect . i also thought some of the dialogue was a bit silly . overall , i was fairly bored with this movie . it's not terrible , but not very good either . my vote for No Mercy is a
472730	11423174	105446	5.0	movie about a serial killer , with a bit of a twist	" Evil Lives aka " Soulmates " is weird to say the least . it's a Gothic horror / comedy / romance . the movie is very humorous at times , and many people might think it is unintentional . however , i believe it actually intends to be humorous and doesn't take itself seriously at all . it borrows from many other movies , so it's not original by any means . there are lapses in logic and what seems like bad acting . but like i said , it's all done tongue in cheek . if you listen carefully to the dialogue , you will notice this . i did not see anything resembling horror in it , but there is some suspense . there is a romance of sorts , but it's very twisted . it also moves quite slowly and is boring at times . basically it's about a serial killer of sorts , but no ordinary serial killer . there is an added element which makes the movie a bit more interesting than it would otherwise be , and it's amusing at times . the acting is deliberately over the top . this is no masterpiece , but it's not awful either . i give it
473618	11423174	105242	5.0	spares no expense with the " disgust " factor	i didn't really like this movie . i found it boring for two thirds . not a lot happens . and then , once things start happening , the movie gets pretty sickening at times . i don't mean that in the " Saw " series kind of way . this is much different than that . to me , it was just too much . you'll have to watch it to see what i mean . i also thought the movie was kind of confusing at times , but that may be just me . i thought the acting was good , especially by Chris Sarandon as the main character / villain in the movie . i don't think the movie was badly done . the makeup effects , i thought were pretty good , just too disgusting . if you have a lot of patience too get through the slow parts , and you have a really strong stomach , you might like this movie . or maybe you won't find it slow or even very disgusting and you might still like it . i can watch most slasher / horror movies with no problem . but like i said this movie is a whole new category of disgust . by the way , i haven't mentioned anything about the general plot line but you can probably use your imagination , based on the title . although i didn't like this movie on the whole , i will give the filmmakers credit for making a movie that comes very close to exceeding my disgust threshold , something i thought would never happen . as a result , i give " The Resurrected "
473419	11423174	70292	5.0	slow	this is one movie i can't say i liked or disliked . it was all story , not much anything else , which isn't necessarily bad . it was mostly as slow as molasses flowing uphill in January , yet just interesting enough to keep watching . it was also pretty glum , in my opinion . of course the typical stereotypes of the era are here in full force . not a horrible movie by any standard , but not great by any standard either . it's one of those movies where i could take it or leave it . after it ended , i was pretty much indifferent o the whole thing . it wouldn't matter to me whether i saw it again or not . but maybe i'm being too hard on it . maybe it is what it was supposed to be , a simple crime drama . anyway , for me , The laughing Policeman is a
472606	11423174	79945	5.0	poses some interesting philosophical questions , but . .	it just takes too long to get there . the movie is 136 minutes and in the first the first 65 or so , not much of any import happens . at least in my opinion . about halfway through , the story picks up a bit , but i didn't really find it all that engaging or compelling . there just doesn't seem to be much sense of urgency given the threat that the Enterprise has to deal with . i also found the movie lacking in excitement or suspense . as i said in the summary , the movie does pose some interesting philosophical questions , but it doesn't do much more than that . normally , that might not be such a bad thing , but in a Star Trek movie , i kinda expected some excitement and sense of danger , as well . to be perfectly honest , i think the threat in this movie is not as developed as it could have been . i found the movie to be more of a showcase for the special effects , and visually it does look quite nice . and the musical score is quite good . it's very fitting for the movie . overall though , i think this is a case of style over substance . i'm not saying this is a horrible movie , but i was disappointed . my vote for Star Trek : The Motion Picture :
473012	11423174	54594	5.0	much better than the Robin Williams remake Flubber	i won't say this a great movie , but i will say it sure beats the dreadful 1997 remake called Flubber starring Robin Williams . that movie was tedious , to say the least . this movie , at least , was somewhat entertaining , if not all that funny . there are a couple of mildly amusing moments . there is a lot of overacting , which i have found quite typical of Disney movies of that era ( 1950's through 70's ) but that was probably funny back then . Fred MacMurray plays the main character , professor Brainard , a chemistry professor who discovers a new compound that should revolutionize the world . of course , he's so busy working on his experiments , he neglects everything else in his life . MacMurray is very appealing and likable , as he is in any of his movies . my vote for The Absent Minded Professor is a
473025	11423174	120694	5.0	good idea , not so good movie	maybe it's just me , but i found this Halloween movie lacking . the idea was a good one , having this one take place twenty years after the events in the first and second films . all the sequels in between are ignored . however , i didn't find that much else to like about it . for one thing , i found the first hour quite slow . very little happens up to that point . plus , i thought the acting was below par in this one , even for this genre . but the biggest thing i realized , was that the character of Michael Myers does not inspire fear in this one . in fact , i found him kind of laughable . maybe it's just because there have been so many psycho villains since then , that the character isn't really that different from the rest . the point is , he just doesn't have much of an impact . i also thought some of the dialogue was pretty bad in this one . but the biggest thing for me , is that the way things happened in this movie just weren't realistic . i just didn't see it happening . despite all that , i still think it was a better film than the last one , part 6 : The curse of Michael Myers . for me Halloween H2O : Twenty Years Later is a
473676	11423174	396652	5.0	bland	for me , this movie was just bland . not really boring , but not really interesting either . it just plods along to the end . i also thought most of the characters were not interesting . in fact , some of them were unlikable . there are some good actors in this movie , but they seem to sleep walk through it for the most part . once in awhile there is a bot of overacting , at least in my mind . a little levity ( humour ) would have made the movie better . it's just takers the subject matter too seriously , in my mind . basically , i was disappointed in this movie . i had higher expectations . not the worst movie movie ever made , just sort of middle of the road for the genre . my vote for Ice Princess is a
473891	11423174	200469	5.0	low budget schlock , but entertaining a times ( )	this is a strange little movie . i mean it's very low budget and mostly poorly acted , perhaps on purpose . i'd swear it was done tongue in cheek yet at the same time it seems to take itself seriously . it has some pretty cringe worthy dialogue to say the least , and the story is quite silly , in my mind . at the same time though , it is fairly fun , and some of the characters are interesting . it's no masterpiece . in fact far from it . but i did find it a passably entertaining diversion . if you keep you expectation level really low for this movie , you might get some enjoyment out of it . it wasted around 85 minutes or so ( not counting the end credits . it's not memorable , and once it's over , you'll forget all about it . for me , Bats is a
473021	11423174	403358	5.0	a real mishmash	a friend of mine had told me this movie was horrible . but , i decided to give it a try any way . it starts off pretty awful , then slowly gets watchable . but then it turns not so good again . not as awful as it was at the beginning , but not really very good either . the problem i found with the movie is that a lot of the time , it's muddled and close to incoherent . and when i could follow it , it wasn't really anything spectacular . plus there are a lot of things that don't make sense . the concept of light versus darkness is not really original , but this movie tweaks the concept slightly , putting its own little spin on it . unfortunately , it's not enough to elevate the movie . if you're an action buff , you might find this movie boring , as the action is fairly sparse . for me , the movie never quite got exciting enough to be anything more than average . and the ending is even less exciting than the rest of the movie . i don't quite agree with me friend that this movie was awful , it just wasn't really good either . i'd have to give Night Watch a
473598	11423174	106627	5.0	middle of the road fare	i saw this movie when it first came out and loved . i thought it was brilliant . then i watched again yesterday , and my opinion has really changed . i wasn't too impressed this tome around . i think the movie is just too tame , and nothing really special . it's also slow , and not just in spots but all through . i wouldn't quite call it boring , but it is pretty close . there just isn't really a lot of suspense or tension . at least i didn't feel any . i don't think the actors can be faulted . they were all decent with what they were given . i think it had more to do with the script than anything . i really liked the music for the movie . i thought it was catchy and infectious . other than that though , there's not much to recommend this movie . it isn't horrible , but it just isn't any better or worse than many movies of the thriller genre . so for " The Crush " seems fair
473148	11423174	418627	5.0	A ghost horror story with little new ( but the atmosphere is fairly effective )	Death Tunnel is really nothing new , or special . it's a horror / ghost story . and again we have the tag line " based on true events " . whether movie is based on or inspired by true events really adds no merit to the movie . I'm won't give any of the plot away , but it has all been done before . also , the movie plods along at a snail's pace for nearly 2 thirds oft its running time . there are a few positives about the movie , however . one is that it is filled with an atmosphere of choking dread and oppression , which is always a good thing . also , the raw . unpolished look of the film added more of a realism to the events . the movie also had a morbid feeling to it ( always a good thing ) . the choice of music was different , but seems to work in this case . the acting however was hit and miss . sometimes the actors were believable , other times-not so much . , if you are a gore hound , this movie will disappoint . there is not much gore or blood to speak of . there is one scene which is moderately gory at best . they should have made it gorier . this movie tries to play on your psyche , but it doesn't really work . the ghosts do not inspire fear . the special effects for the ghosts were not great , but i will say the makeup dept did a good job with the dead bodies and such . the low budget really shows in a couple places . there was one really fake looking cgi shot ( of the building ) , and one shot which was clearly a miniature used for the building . the movie has little in the way of scares , but it's air of dread coupled with the morbid feel may make you ill at ease . i recommend " Boo " instead . as for Death Tunnel , i give it based upon the fairly effective atmosphere
472749	11423174	475937	5.0	patience is a virtue , and . . . ,	you will need it for this movie . it moves along pretty slow , bu to be fair it does build some suspense , and there a few good scares , and one blood curling moments , in my opinion . the character ( there are just two main ones ) are interesting , and the idea of the story is interesting . the setting is very appropriate . the acting is good , and the dialogue is sparse . yet is still found it lacking . here's why . even though there is some suspense , most times , those moments are dragged out too far , past where the moment should end . at that point , suspense is replaced with boredom and impatience . at least with me . and unfortunately there are a few too many of those moments . there are a few other movies thrown into the mix , so if you're a stickler for originality , this might not be your movie . so , is it worth it in the end ? i'm on the fence with this one . you best bet is to catch this on cable or as a cheap rental . for me , The Abandoned is a
472930	11423174	810895	5.0	has some good moments , but overall disappointing	to me , this is animated Hellboy feature is a mixed bag . firstly , i thought the story was pretty slow . the concept was interesting , but it didn't translate well onto the screen . some of the animation was pretty good , and some of it was pretty poor . the fight scenes were pretty good , i'll admit , and there were some funny bits . the voice acting was good , but it should be , since the same a lot of the actors in the live action features are in this one . i also found that the story , in addition to not being that interesting , was overly complicated and got bogged down quite a bit . there are some things which don't really seem to have context , and could have been left out . still , it wasn't anywhere near the worst movie i've seen . for me , Hellboy Animated : Sword of Storms is a
473921	11423174	109552	5.0	" Vengeance has many casualties . the guilty and the innocent "	i didn't think this movie was as good as the first one . to me , it didn't distinguish itself from most other revenge movies . it felt like one of the Death Wish films . the theme in the movie was vigilantism . at least that's the impression i got . also , i don't feel the title character evolved from the first one . he has little to do here . Arnold Vosloo takes over the role of Darkman , and does a good job with what he he has , but it isn't much good , when your character is is not very well defined . if only they had went somewhere worthy of the character , this could have been a good movie . as it is , i would say it passes about 90 minutes , and is watchable . but so are many movies . i'd say this was a disappointing follow up to the first film , but that's just me . my vote for Darkman II : The Return of Durant is a at best .
472933	11423174	468569	5.0	for me , it doesn't even touch Batman Begins	i loved the previous Batman film , Batman Begins . i thought it was brilliant , possibly the best superhero movie ever made . and with stratospheric hype this newest film had , combined with the trailers i had seen , i knew i had to see it . many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype , so i expected something earth shattering . to say i was disappointed is an understatement . there were moments where i was bored , and hoped it would end soon . Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me . it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel . either that , or had a bad case of laryngitis . maybe there was a reason behind this . but all it did was annoy me . as for Heath Ledger , and his performance as The Joker , i found it OK , but i wouldn't say it was award worthy . i mean no disrespect by this . when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre , neither the the character of The Joker , or any aspect of the movie stayed with me . bottom line , i didn't find anything profound in this movie . i was massively disappointed . it doesn't even touch Batman Begins , in my opinion . for me , The Dark Knight is a .
473502	11423174	452894	5.0	pathetic soundtrack mars an otherwise halfway decent suspense movie .	if i could use one word to describe this movie , it would be : disconcerting . not really scary , but there was a slight air of unease hovering over the film . the acting was surprisingly okay , and the premise was an interesting one : 50 years ago , two children disappeared , a young boy and a young girl . the girl's remains were found , but the boy was never seen again . it was rumoured that he was possessed by a local Indian tribe which may have killed the girl as part of a ritual to stop a severe drought . originally the natives apparently used a white dog in their ritual , ( hence the title ) rather than humans . no reason is given as to why they would then kill a girl instead . flash forward to present time . five people are sharing a cabin in the same remote location where the girl's body had been found found . I'll leave it at that . the one really annoying problem with this film is the soundtrack . every once in awhile a rock song would startup , which sounded as if the so called band would fail to make the grade as a bar band in the worst fleabag bar in existence . there were at least four occurrences of this , and each band was as horrible as the last . add to that the music does not fit the movie in any way . i'm suspecting the filmmakers hired the band as a favour to someone . it is this element which nearly sinks the movie into " B " movie oblivion . the other problem was the stupid and unsatisfying ending . i'll give this a / 10
473465	11423174	449089	5.0	typical road trip gone wrong / family bonding movie with a moral	Rv is basically national lampoon's " Vacation " lite . it is essentially a road trip disaster , family bonding along the way road trip . predictable , but funny in parts . the movie doesn't have the edge that vacation has and a some of the humour is potty humour . decent acting by all , but not much of a challenge for the actors . this movie has been done before , with varying degrees of success . some have been better ( vacation ) some worse . ( i won't mention any by name . there is one thing RV has that the other movies don't , and that is a message , specifically the value and importance of family . ordinarily i would say this would be a bit too preachy , but it is only in the latter stages of the film that we are treated to the sermon . overall the movie tries hard to be funny only succeeding on rare occasions . RV is neither a good movie or a bad movie . it lies somewhere in between . hence it rates
473438	11423174	443295	5.0	disappointing in the comedy dept	Admiral Frank Beardsly ( Dennis Quaid ) marries his high school sweet heart , Helen North ( Rene Russo ) . thing is , he has 8 kids , and she has 10 . his kids are strait laced by the book , owing to growing up with an admiral for a father . her kids are free spirited , with much more freedom of expression due to their mothers influence . so , the families merge and with the kids being total opposites , you would think this is a recipe for disaster . well , it should have been . but for some reason , it just doesn't seem to work . i think i laughed about 3 times , and that was courtesy of the pig . the rest of the time , i just waited , hoping for something funny to come along . and the typical Hollywood ending didn't help much . now , this is not a horrible movie , in fact it is entertaining at times , but i expected to laugh more , and based on that , i give " Yours , Mine and Ours " .
473647	11423174	618191	5.0	not that great an episode	this is the 3rd Justice League Episode i have seen in a row , the other two being The Return and For the man Who Has Everything . i didn't find this episode as good as either of the other two . this one has two related plot lines happening at the same time . unfortunately , we we barely even see the heroes , or the villains , for that matter . plus , i also didn't think the story was all that interesting , and the the episode was very slow paced . this episode was quite a letdown all around , from the other two episodes . by the way , all 3 of the episodes can be found on the Justice League Unlimited DVD entitled Joining Forces . anyway , as for this episode , i wouldn't call it awful , but i don't think it was great either . my vote for Justice League : The Greatest Story Never Told is a
472884	11423174	618183	5.0	part 1of 2 episodes	this the first of a two part episode . i can't say i was overly impressed with this episode . for one thing , i didn't think the voices fit , but maybe that just takes some getting used to . after all , this is the first full episode of the Justice League o have seen . however , i also didn't think the story was that great . i found it ordinary . this episode only features The Flash and Green Lantern . i will say though , that the episode was very fast paced . it was over before i knew it . i also liked the touches of humour . i didn't really like the animation that much , but again , that could be something that takes getting used to . i find it hard to rate this particular episode . there are some things i didn't like about it , yet i didn't find it awful , or boring . despite the problems i had with it , it certainly passes the time . i give it a
472846	11423174	213203	5.0	slightly better than the original	i thought this was a slightly better movie than the first one . it starts out the same , though . with about half an hour left , the movie becomes oddly involving and actually held me interest . once again , this movie is filled with references only adults would understand . this movie has a cheeky edge to it that the firs tone didn't have . it's thankfully , not as loud as the last one , and there are less annoying musical type songs . there is a bit of toilet humour this time around . again though , the kids will probably enjoy it and the adults will be mostly unsatisfied . it's unfortunate , since there are so many clearly geared toward adults . for me , This second Rugrats movie is a
473240	11423174	109445	5.0	i didn't think it was anything special	i did not think this was a good movie . i didn't find it profound or anything . if you work as a clerk in a convenience store or video store , you'll probably appreciate it more . for me , i thought it was mostly just two guys swearing a lot . there is some good dialogue on occasion though . the movie was made in black and white , which isn't a bad thing . sometimes it makes for more realistic atmosphere . it does that in this case . most of the cast had not acted in a film before . some have gone on to continue acting , while other haven't . this is Kevin Smith's directorial debut , and he also wrote the script . i know many people hail this movie as a great achievement , but i'm not one of them . i found this movie average at best . for me , Clerks is a
473607	11423174	83033	5.0	average spoof , with a few amusing moments	this is a spoof of other movies of that era , some horror , some not . i found it silly more than anything , and at times it denigrates into near stupidity . i was able to watch the whole movie , though it is quite slow at times . it does have some mildly amusing moments , coupled with some intentionally ( or not ) ultra cheap special effects , and some really bizarre looking monsters , some even stupid looking . this movie definitely inspired other movies down the road , some good , some bad . there isn't really anything resembling acting in the movie , except for Richard Benjamin who is quite good as the unflappable ( or clueless ) father who doesn't bat an eye , no matter what bizarre happenings are occurring right under his nose . he is quite amusing at times . otherwise , there is a lot of screaming and running around . For me , " Saturday the 14th " is a
473547	11423174	435705	5.0	good news . i just saved fifteen percent on my car insurance ,	oh yeah , and i also watched this movie . i wasn't really impressed . i'd say it was a run of the mill thriller , except it isn't really thrilling . the premise holds promise , but doesn't deliver . it's basically about a guy who can see two minutes into the future . the F . B . I . finds out about his gift and tries to use him to prevent a nuclear disaster . there's a bit more to the story , but there's nothing really that makes the movie compelling . the movie Stars Nic Cage as the main character , with Julianne Moore as the main F . B . I . agent . Jessica Biel also stars , but she is really just window dressing in this one . Cage and Moore seem to be just going through the motions here . for me , Next is an average movie at best .
473149	11423174	290002	5.0	decent , but lackluster follow up to the original	The follow up to Meet the Parents is generally a decent film . not as funny as the first , and a bit tedious at times , but all in all not a bad effort . In this installment , Pam's parents , the Byrnes ( Robert Deniro and Blythe Danner ) meet Greg's parent's , the Fockers ( Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand ) . the two families are like night and day , which should make for some hilarity , but fall a bit flat . there are some funny moments , just not as many as there could be , and this movie is not always entertaining . there are some spots that lag or scenes that could have been cut . the movie doesn't flow as smoothly as it should . The acting is fine . it is the material that is lackluster . i believe there are plans for a third installment . if so lets hope they iron out any bugs and maybe the third will be more on par with the first . this movie is average , but could have been so much more . out of 10
472723	11423174	289992	5.0	too many preposterous twists and the end twist doesn't ring true	this wasn't the movie i was expecting . i thought it would be clever and thought provoking . i was half right it . was thought provoking . it tries to be clever , but only succeeds in being too clever for it's own good . it's just way too convoluted with ridiculous plot twist after plot twist . the final plot twist is not logical and comes out of thin air . it's not predictable , because it doesn't make sense and isn't realistic . it seems almost tacked on . there are some good dramatic moments and some suspense here , along with good acting . Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet are both fine . as i said , the movie will make you think . it does bring up relevant , topical issues . but when you get right down to it , it isn't believable . and that ending sinks it . my vote for the Life Of David Gale is a
472661	11423174	109403	5.0	alleged comedy , but not really	Chasers is billed as a comedy-which would be fine-if it were a comedy . in reality it's more like a drama / slash action film with some humour sparsely sprinkled here and there . very sparsely sprinkled . it is mildly entertaining , but not worth watching more than once-at least for a long time . that says a lot , considering the fact that Erica Eleniak is in it . alas even she cannot elevate this movie to anything beyond average . Dennis Hopper directed this movie-why i'm not sure . yes there is some action and Hopper himself has a completely ridiculous and pointless cameo . if you have nothing better to do , you could use up 101 minutes of your life on this movie . it's not the worst movie you've seen or will see . but it is , put simply-blah . in other words a completely forgettable movie . 5 because of Erica
472787	11423174	867286	5.0	neither good nor bad ,	but somewhere in between . James Van Der Beek has come a long way since his Dawson's Creek days . he was actually very good here . he plays a scientist sent to a small fishing community to find out why the fish stocks have depleted . Alexandra Castillo is also good as the local only ) law enforcement in the town . the movie itself is entertaining enough . there's not really much excitement though . for a creature feature , you don't see much of the creature . most of time , you are shown only a tentacle or two . there is one scene which shows the beast ( a giant squid ) but it's not a really clear view . for me , Eye of the Beast is somewhere in the middle , so i give it
473095	11423174	89530	5.0	does nothing to improve on the two previous installments	i think this a case of the Mad Max series losing steam . the first movie , simply entitled Mad Max , was exciting from start to finish . the second , Entitled Mad Max 2 : the Warrior had less but more intense action sequences and a better story . it also developed the character of Max ( Mel Gibson ) . however , this third installment does nothing to set itself apart , in terms of anything new , from the first 2 . it's really just old hat , just not done as well as the previous installments , particularly number 2 . i was quite frankly bore through out , just waiting for it to finally end . Tina Turner is in the movie , but unfortunately she has little screen time . i don't think this was a poorly made movie , just a boring one . my vote for Mad Max Max Beyond Thunderdome is a
473546	11423174	96119	5.0	this is the cut version . for the uncut version Check out the Anchor Bay edition	well , this installment of the Sleepaway Camp series is actually better than part two by far . it's also better than part one . this one starts off pretty good . it's also even a bit amusing at times with some decent one liners there , and there are a few inventive kills this time around . if you a gore hound though , this movie won't likely satisfy you . it isn't very graphic . there is some nudity , which never hurts . plus , this movie actually goes by a lot quicker . it's still not great by any means , but i think it's the best of the first three movies . the acting is nothing spectacular , for the most part . the lone exception is Pamela Springsteen as the psycho . she really nails the deadpan delivery of those one liners . when you add it all up , i guess this version of Sleepaway Camp III : teenage Wasteland is about a . by the way , this version of the movie is the cut version . for the uncut version , checkout the Anchor Bay edition , which is gorier and also has special features . and if you're a real fan , check out the three disc collection called Sleepaway Camp ( with survival kit ) which contains all three movie uncut and with special features .
472644	11423174	76798	5.0	the spiders were the best actors	this movie isn't ' total crap , but it's not great either . but you cant really expect much from these types of movies . there's almost no suspense and not very much excitement in this movie . it just sort of plods along to the end . it's entertaining , if nothing else . i mean , you get some horrid dialogue , sometimes delivered just as horridly . the acting isn't great , and some of the characters are as dumb as could be . i guess it's sort of in the category of so bad it's good . i thought the spiders were pretty good actors , at least . i've watched quite a few of these movies and this one is no better or worse than any other one of this type . i find this type of movie a good way to waste 90 minutes or so . besides , none of these movies come close to being the worst movie i have seen , so that's something .
472950	11423174	347411	5.0	a little too focused on family subplots , not enough on the storms , for my taste	this movie is too melodramatic at times and gets bogged down in dialogue and subplots that don't really advance the story , in my opinion . the acting is not bad , especially from Noel Fisher who plays Jeremy Landis , the teenage son of the lead female character Dr . Valery Landis ( Joanna Pacula ) a weather specialist . there is at least 1 positive thing about the movie , and that is the scenes involving the lightning storms . the effects are fairly well done , int his regard . i certainly didn't hate this movie , but i do wish it had focused more on the storm aspect than the family issues . it kind of felt like 1 of those ' Lifetime ' channel movies . if you don't mind that kind of movie , then you will probably like this 1 . if not , you might want to avoid it . i'd have to say this movie is average , so seems fair .
472553	11423174	95897	5.0	Okay military crime drama ,	but nothing special . no suspense or tension , and characters i didn't care about . i also thought the storyline was underdeveloped . for me , there was way too much talking and very little in the way of action or excitement . it's 92 minutes i could have been doing something else . it's not horrible , by any means , but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations . which is a real shame , considering Sean Connery and Mark Harmon are in it . both put in real good performances , but it's the story that lets them down . Meg Ryan also appears but has a very small role . long before it was over , i didn't care what happened to who , and i just wanted it too end . i give The Presidio a
472693	11423174	844894	5.0	number 4 in the series	i can't say this is an awful movie . it's just that it is so slow . until the last 15 minutes , nothing much happens . there is very little excitement , and i didn't find the storyline compelling . nor were there any great characters . there is some nudity , which doesn't really bother me . i am a guy , after all . and though there isn't a lot of profanity , what profanity there was , i felt was unnecessary and did not have any context in the movie . i don't mind profanity , but there should be a purpose or reason for it . but there is some good news . the special makeup and creature effects were pretty good overall . the acting was OK . and this movie is certainly better than the unfortunate Species 2 . i don't think it's as good as the original Species , and it's certainly nowhere near as good as Species 3 , which to me , is the best of the series . to me , this movie is somewhere in the middle . i give Species : The Awakening
473621	11423174	104864	5.0	i thought it was an average suspense chase movie	to me this movie was watchable , but not great . there was some excitement and suspense , but not as much as i had hoped for . the acting is pretty good . the characters were okay , although i thought Jan Michael Vincent's character was very strange and out of place in this movie . the movie didn't always hold my interest and my mind sometimes wandered . the basic plot of the movie is that a man videotapes some crooked police beating another man . the police notice they are being taped . from there , the man and his wife go on the run to escape the crooked cops who want the videotape . as far as this genre of movies goes , this movie is average . if you have nothing better to do , you could do worse . but , like i said there were times when my mind wandered , due to some slow spots . this is certainly not the worst movie of the genre i have ever seen , but not the best either . many people may really enjoy this movie . it just depends on your taste . for me , i give " Midnight Witness "
473895	11423174	265208	5.0	disappointing	boy , what a let down this movie was . i viewed the unrated version , which promised more sex , more skin , more laughs . from what i saw , there was very little skin here , not much sex , either , and zero laughs . Elisha Cuthbert is nice , but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was . you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it , and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy . unfortunately , something got lost in the translation for me , as the jokes weren't funny . in fact , i found the movie bland . though this version was unrated , the original version was rated R by the MPAA . in Canada , it was 18A , except for Ontario , which was 14A . i happen to agree withe 14A rating . for me , that's what it should have been rated , including the unrated version . my best advice , if you're a parent , is to pre screen the movie , and decide if you children are mature enough for it . for me , The Girl Next Door is a
473120	11423174	95925	5.0	nice dark atmosphere , but the story is slow	this film is more of a supernatural film than horror film . it isn't really scary , though it is creepy . it maintains a great dark atmosphere throughout . i thought the makeup effects were pretty elaborate for the creature , but that's just my opinion . the creature itself seemed pretty realistic , including its movements . as for the characters , they weren't really very likable , so it's hard to feel anything for their plight . the acting is merely adequate , with no real standouts , but Lance Henrickson was pretty good in his role . he was certainly the best in the movie . the movie itself tends to be slow art times . overall , id give Pumpkinhead a
473371	11423174	74575	5.0	spaghetti Western starring Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palnce	i don't know what to make of this Spaghetti western starring Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance , and directed by Gianfranco Parolini , who was also known as Frank Kramer . it's very similar in style to The Man with no name trilogy by Sergio Leone . i didn't find it all that great . it plods along slowly , until the last 20 minutes or so , when it becomes somewhat interesting . it's an Italian production , obviously , and the dubbing is not that great . also , also the the acting was pretty bad , mostly by the extras , who were probably not actual actors , just people hired for the movie . i also thought the movie was disjointed at times , and didn't always make a lot of sense . but maybe i'm just missing something . anyway , as a piece of entertainment , it's mildly OK , but nothing spectacular . for me , God's Gun is a
473397	11423174	55277	5.0	a bit too mellow	while i will say this movie is certainly family friendly , i didn't really like it all that much . i felt it was too long and slow . i think it could have been 30 minutes shorter without missing anything important . the acting is good , but i found the characters bland and uninteresting . Hayley Mills is is a decent enough actress , and it must be hard for one actor to play twins convincingly , which Mills does . but the movie is a bit too mellow for my tastes . I did like Maureen O'Hara as the mother . she stood out from the rest . Brian Keith was also good as the father . this is definitely a movie the whole family can watch . i did think it was a bit mellow , but to be fair there were a few fun scenes , and some catchy songs . my vote for The Parent trap is a
473520	11423174	94074	5.0	an improvement over Superman III	this movie had a better storyline than number three . ( actually there's two story lines ) . it isn't as silly either . the problem though , lies how cheaply made it is . the special effects , if you can call them that , are laughable . the acting also seems to suffer here . it seems the actors knew they were in a a poorly done movie , so they may as well put as little effort as possible into their performances . frankly , to me , most of the actors look embarrassed to be there . i will say that choice of villain was good , but the character himself is too over the top for me . plus , the fight scenes are way too protracted . the movie does also get a bit sappy at times , which i guess you can expect given its subject matter . still , it was a bit too much for me . however , despite its problems , i like this movie more than number three . for me , Superman IV is a
473215	11423174	117774	5.0	i wish it had more action	this movie was not bad . it's a little too dramatic for my tastes . there is some action , just not as much as i'd hoped for . i was bored for a lot of it . there's a lot of talking in this movie , but nothing memorable about that aspect . the concept has likely been done before . a new substitute takes over teaching duties usually in a classroom full of troubled teens / gang members , delinquents , etc . but this sub is no ordinary sub . he has skills . in fact he isn't actually a teacher . but he pretend to be . he has ulterior motives . usually , someone he knows has been either killed or seriously injured . so he poses as a teacher to find out the truth . he usually teaches the students , some of them anyway , respect for themselves and tries to get them on the right track in life . that's pretty much the plot line for the substitute , among other similar movies . if you like that kind of movie , and you don't mind a fair amount of dialogue , with a bit of action , you might like " The Substitute " . i didn't like it all that much , so i'd have to give it a
473924	11423174	120245	5.0	not quite what i had hoped , but racing buffs will probably enjoy it	i should mention that i'm not really a racing fan . nevertheless , i picked this documentary up fairly cheap , and i thought it might be interesting and thrilling . and to be fair , it was-to a point . the scenes with the closeups of the car racing as it's being tested are quite exciting . the cameras are right on the car , so you can't get any closer unless you're actually behind the wheel . theses scenes really show you how skilled the drivers are and how dangerous the sport can be . and hearing the roar of engines was something . you really get an idea of how powerful they are . but for me , there were'nt enough of those moments . a lot of the time is spent showing how a car ( at least one car ) is manufactured . i knew before hand that there were would be some focus on this aspect . i just thought they devoted too much time to it . f you're into that sort of thing of thing , you will probably enjoy theses scenes . but for me , i'm not really into that sort of thing , so i found those scenes dry . there is a making of feature , which is almost as long as the documentary itself . this is not something that would interest me , so i did not watch it . however , if you're a racing fan , or you're just interested in the behind the scenes of the documentary , you might like the making of . overall , for me , i was kinda disappointed . i don't think the documentary is terrible by any stretch , but it did not live up to my expectations . i'd have to give Super Speedway a
472591	11423174	378109	5.0	disappointing to me	to me , this movie was disappointing . it's not a horrible film , but it just seemed blah . i do think some of the underwater scenes were nice , but other than that , i didn't find it interesting . i find it ironic that a movie involving deep sea diving has such a shallow plot . this is just my opinion . that wouldn't have bothered me so much , if the movie were fun and entertaining , but it just didn't it do for me . i don't think the movie was awful , it just wasn't anything . a movie about the deep blue turns out to be ' beige ' . ( bland ) i don't know what else to say , except that i probably wouldn't recommend It to my friends , based on my impressions , but to each their own . i guess i'd say this movie was average , therefore i give it
473201	11423174	95993	5.0	disappointing sequel	i didn't think this this sequel to The Man From Snowy River was that great . i thought it was too drawn out . plus , it was fairly heavy on the romance angle , which isn't my cup of tea . Tom Burlinson returns as Jim Craig , the title character in the first movie . Sigrid Thornton returns as his love interest . Kurt Douglas played her father , Harrison , in the original . Brian Denehey plays that role in this movie . this is not the worst movie i have seen , but it wasn't as good as i'd hoped . still , just like the first one , there is some very beautiful scenery , and a great musical score . Burlinson and Thornton are both decent actors , at least in this movie . Dennehy is also good . for me , Return to Snowy River is a
473641	11423174	324941	5.0	young kids will love it	while i didn't think this was a bad movie , i don't think it holds a candle to the first 101 Dalmatians movie . i found it much slower for the first half or so , and then it piked up . there's quite a bit of slapstick , once again involving Cruella de vil and her henchmen Horace and Jasper . this movie is certainly much more colourful than number 1 . however , Cruella is a pale shadow of herself in this one . she's is much less evil , more of a parody of herself from the first movie . The Patch referred to in the title is one of the Dalmatian Puppies . older children and adults may think it a bit slow , ( there is less excitement or thrills ) ) and lacking much in the way of story , but young children will love this movie . for me , i Give 1001 Dalmatians II : Patch's London Adventure a
473643	11423174	28119	5.0	not as good as i had hoped	this is only the second animated Popeye short i have seen , the first one being With Swee ' Pea , which i thought was pretty good . this one , i didn't like as much . it doesn't stack up too well , in my opinion . there's a lot of action , but i didn't find a lot of it all that funny . Bluto ( Popeye's nemesis ) plays Sinbad as a blow hard ego maniac . he has a few singing numbers , which are very brief , but i found them irritating . this feature is around 15 minutes long , and i found it a bit slow , even boring . With Swee ' Pea was much more lite hearted , and " Sinbad " was much darker than i was expecting . i guess it's really a matter of taste . for me , Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor is a
473558	11423174	87075	5.0	a bizarre , very stylistic take on " little red riding hood "	Neil Jordan's company of wolves is a strange movie , to say the least . it is esoteric and surreal , and filled with imagery and symbolism . aesthetically speaking it is beautiful to watch . this is not a movie about werewolves per SE , but a commentary on the human condition and the beast that lurks within us all . the movie also contains strong sexual undertones and delves a bit into some disturbing subject matter including a young girl , perhaps fourteen or fifteen and an adult male . there are strong undercurrents of sexual chemistry between the two , and while nothing sexual does occur , the implication is clearly there . the movie is purely fantasy , of course , and at times cartoonish , sometimes to the point of absurdity . at times it is simply a parody of itself . the transformations are nothing spectacular , which may be intentional . the movie doesn't take itself seriously but is certainly not a comedy . it is certainly stylish , and also has substance , which is not readily apparent , at first glance . it is interesting to watch , and i can't say whether i will watch it again or not . i didn't dislike nor did i particularly like it . it is however a unique experience . i should mention that there is one scene which i found quite disgusting which occurs about twenty minutes in , so you might want to prepare yourself . certainly a hard film to rate , but i will give it based on the look of the film and its uniqueness . not for everybody . out of 10
473225	11423174	87050	5.0	creepy music , but no real scares	not bad , i guess . it had some creepy moments , courtesy of some ' Omen ' type music . you know , the chanting in Latin . it wasn't really scary , though . the concept is neat , but not wholly original . there was an original Star Trek episode that may have inspired the idea for the short story . and it also has elements of the 70's movie The Wicker Man . anyway , it's certainly got Stephen King written all over it . it's quite twisted , to say the least . it's not very graphic at all though . in fact , it's quite tame . i thought it could have been a TV movie , actually . i even checked this site to see if it was . the effects are cheesy , but i've seen a lot worse . the acting is OK , for the most part . but the guy who played the cult leader was very convincing . he exuded evil . the acting by the children was adequate , i guess , although one of the girls was very good in her role . i did feel that the guy who played the second in command tended to overact a bit . he was kinda creepy though . there have been countless sequels , and watching this movie doesn't inspire me to run out and watch any of them , though i may watch them in time . for me , Children of the Corn is a
472618	11423174	48789	5.0	starts out slow , picks up steam in second half	as far as western go , this one is pretty decent once you get past the half way point . until then , it's a bit slow , with not much happening . after that , things pick up and the story gets interesting . it follows the formula of many western of the day . corrupt landowner wants all the neighboring land around him and has the law in his pocket , so to speak . but of course there's always someone who won't be forced off his land . a feud of sorts erupts , and people on both sides die . i was surprised at the ending . it wasn't how i expected things to end . and there's also a little bit of a twist , if you can call it that , that was interesting . given the title , i expected the movie to be more violent . in fact , the violence is minimal and tame , even by the standards of the day . for me , The Violent men is a
473400	11423174	278504	5.0	unfortunately " Sleep Aid " would have been a more apt title ( although they tried hard to make this one work )	i didn't like this movie too much . as a matter of fact , it nearly put me to sleep . how's that for irony . the movie is basically about murder which occurs in a small Alaskan town . two big city cops are sent to investigate . the twist to this movie . the sun doesn't set , which throws everything out of whack for the detectives and complicates their investigation . Robin Willima is in this one , in another darker role for him . Al Pacino , Hilary Swank and Martin Donovan also star . there's nothing wrong with the acting , but the movie is much to methodical , as it slowly plods from one clue ( or non clue ) to the next . as i said earlier , i had a heck of a time staying awake with this one . Christopher Nolan directed this movie , but he cannot be blamed for this one . the writing is the culprit here . i suspect , it looked good on paper and even while they were filming , but somehow the end product doesn't seem to work . i think they tried really hard with this one , but sometimes things just don't work out the way you planned . this is not a horrible film , but it's just missing something . i give " Insomnia " for the effort .
472996	11423174	211443	5.0	where no Friday the 13th movie has gone before	this 10th installment in the never ending Friday the 13th series of films is is a blend of science fiction , action adventure and comedy . it's set in space in the year 2455 , and is pretty much ignores the rest of the films , other than still having a hockey masked Jason slaughtering people . it's somewhat entertaining , and funny on occasion , with a fair amount of action . and Jason gets an upgrade of sorts , so that was kinda interesting . it also has its slow moments where it's a bit too talky . and i feel the acting in this one is worse than in any of the others . but the idea to set it in space is fairly novel , if nothing else . for me , this 10 movie in the series gets a
473361	11423174	69291	5.0	has some amusing moments	there's are certainly a few amusing moments here , and i think i laughed pretty hard twice . overall , though , i thought it would be funnier than it was . it's still entertaining , and it's suitable for the whole family . there's no crude , lewd or potty humour . i think the DVD is missing a bit of footage from the version i viewed on TV way back . there's one hysterical scene that's missing . it's a very memorable scene . too . if you're looking to pass 93 minutes of your time , this movie will certainly do the trick . and who knows , you may even find it drop dead funny . it all depends on your taste . for me , The Snowball Express is a
472779	11423174	81383	5.0	somewhat suspenseful and amusing	this original version of Prom Night is much different than the remake . for one thing , there is actually some suspense in this one . plus the musical score is quite eerie and effective for awhile . at times though , the score just keeps going and going where it gets to be annoying . of course the score always telegraphs the impending death scene . there are also some scenes with the killer chasing the victim , or victims , around , which come off as clumsy and comical . and this being an 80's horror movie , it has that staple of most 80's horror movies - - bad acting . but it also has bad music ( not including the score ) and bad dance moves . however , the movie is mildly entertaining , and it certainly has a dark enough tone . i don't consider a classic , though . for me , Prom Night is a
472637	11423174	81353	5.0	great looking sets , but not much else	This is a movie that makes little sense , but then i don't think it's supposed to . regardless , i didn't think it was that great . i found it slow and boring , and it had too many musical numbers for my taste . but i will say that Robin Williams was good as Popeye , and i liked Shelley Duvall was good as Olive Oyl . i didn't like the character of Bluto very much . he just seemed like a poser full of hot air . maybe that's how he was supposed to be , but i still didn't like him . i did like the look of the film though . i think a lot of effort was put into the sets . to me , the setting looked like an authentic village by the sea . overall though , i wasn't impressed . but if you're a fan of the old Popeye cartoons from the 30's and 40's , you might like this movie . my vote for Popeye is a
473812	11423174	463854	5.0	nowhere near the standard set by the original	for me , this sequel to " 28 Weeks Later " is quite inferior to the first one . i found it slow and very boring for the most part . there is less action , but when there is action , it is relentless and frenetic . this is a good thing , except there are not enough of these scenes in the movie . on the plus side i thought the infected had a much better look in this one . they really looked more enraged in this one . i did not like however , the emphasis on gore in this one , compared to the first . i don't mind gore , but the first one succeeded without it , so this one should have as well . mind you there isn't a lot of gore compared to other movies . but there was too much for this movie . i also didn't like the ending . it was too abrupt for my taste . there was a 5 year gap between the original and this movie . to me , it wasn't worth the wait . i won't say this movie is horrible . it isn't , it just doesn't measure up to the standard of the original . if their is a third , i hope they do a better job than this one . for me , " 28 Weeks Later " is a
473303	11423174	82495	5.0	lacklustre sequel	pretty much blah-is how to describe this movie . i found it even slower , than the original ( boring in fact ) . it's also not scary or even creepy . plus , there are so many things that are preposterous about it all , it's hard to know where to begin . if the movie wasn't so boring , a lot of the absurdities could be forgiven or maybe not even noticed . not so in this movie . i do think that the acting was a bit better though . then again that's not saying much . i really noticed the low budget in this one , which is ironic , considering i think it had a bigger budget than the original . i have seen a lot of abysmal movies , and this does not fall into that category . i did find it lacklustre , though . oh , yeah , there is some nudity in this one , but only one or two scenes . there is is only one scene with the F-word . otherwise , the language isn't that bad . anyway , the most i can give Halloween II is a
473310	11423174	839930	5.0	just be yourself ( )	that seems to be the overriding theme in this animated film . young kids will probably like it due to the bright colours and loud noise . the message is good , but the movie itself is not that special . it is obviously family friendly , as there's nothing objectionable i can think of . so parents . can be pretty confident they can set their kids down in front of this by themselves with no worries . the CG animation is pretty good , and i liked the voice talent . it plods along pretty slowly though to its inevitable conclusion . still , it's not a horrible movie by any stretch . and it's less than 80 minutes , so that's a good thing . and it's a really positive movie . for me , The Nutty Professor ( 2008 ) is a
472684	11423174	496350	5.0	borrows elements form other movies in the genre , but is better than many of them	i didn't mind this movie . it had some definite eerie moments . the atmosphere is great . the music is really haunting , as well . i did find some of the movie similar to others in the genre , but i found it much better than The Ring , or The Grudge . i wish the movie had been more straight forward . i didn't like the fact that it was so loud at times . that kinda annoyed me . i thought Forest Whittaker was good in his role , and Justin Louis was good , as well . but Gabriel Anwar , the lead , i didn't like very much . she seemed too aloof and inaccessible as an actress , and it to me , it came across on screen . maybe that was how the character was supposed to be , but it didn't work for me . for me , The Marsh is a
473748	11423174	29542	5.0	entertaining first movie of the Shadow series	this is the first of 6 in the series of The Shadow movies . i didn't mind it . it's entertaining , though not outstanding . Lamont Cranston AKA The Shadow finds himself in the middle of a mystery . Cranston ( Rod La Rocque ) is also a lawyer and an amateur criminologist , so his skills come in handy and he solves the mystery . possible minor spoilerThe Shadow only makes an appearance , twice , and since they didn't have any cinematic tricks back then , is actually just La Rocque covered in a black cape from head to toe . but still , i wasn't bored , and the movie is entertaining , and that's what counts . for me , The Shadow Strikes is a
473799	11423174	963178	5.0	at least the previews were good	this was a disappointing movie for me . the previews made it look good ( as they usually do ) so i had high hopes for it . sadly though , this thing is mostly boring , and slow . and way too long . not much of excitement happens , and a lot of things are not fully explained , so they don't quite make sense . or maybe i just missed something . i like Clive Owen , and Naomi Watts , but they just happen to be in a lacklustre movie . to be fair , there are a few moments of action and excitement . it just isn't ' enough . now , don't get me wrong . i like drama in my movies sometimes , but these dramatic moments are not that compelling , mostly , i think because of the dialogue , which to me , seemed ordinary . and finally , the ending . not only did it not end when it should have ( being 20 minutes too long ) but the ending didn't really make a lot of sense . despite all that , this is not a horrible movie . and believe me i know horrible when i see it . so for The International is a
473454	11423174	106455	5.0	typical crime drama with nothing memorable	this movie is a so so crime drama . i mean it's not really awful , but it is awfully slow and not really memorable . this movie has been done before , it just had a different title with ( maybe ) different actors , and the same characters but with different names . Wesley Snipes is Jimmy Mercer , an undercover treasury agent who's good friend / work colleague has been killed during an undercover operation . naturally Mercer vows to catch the bad guys . Dan Hedaya is Brady , Mercer's partner . also in the movie are Dennis Hopper , ( you can probably guess what role he plays ) , Viggo Mortensen , Tobin Bell , Paul Gleason , Christine Elise , Johnathon Banks , Lolita Davidovich and Valerie Perrine and Tony Lo Bianco . the people who really impressed me were Valerie Perrine and Dan Hedaya and Paul Gleason . the rest of the cast is all okay , but doesn't really stand out . the movie is just only 92 minutes , but it feels way longer . i just thought it took too long for things to get rolling . and like i mentioned , the movie is not original . the only thing i really like about was is the music , especially the big band stuff . otherwise , it's your stand crime drama , better than some , not as good as others . for me , " Boiling point " is a
473658	11423174	659609	5.0	Scooby and the Gang once again Meet up with the Harlem Globe Trotters	this is another another episode of The New Scooby-Doo movies . Once again the gang meet up with the Harlem Globe trotters and end up in the middle of a mystery . this episode is not too bad . it's actually got some pretty funny moments . it's paced pretty good too . it moves at a good clip . the story wasn't too bad either . . the Globe Trotters had quite a few funny lines and i don't even recall hearing the annoying laugh track this time around . things do get pretty repetitive though . this isn't the worst Scooby Doo adventure I've seen , but it's not the best either . still , it is entertaining and even funny at times . it's probably average at best . for me , The Mystery of Haunted island is a
473795	11423174	157583	5.0	i found the book riveting , the movie - - not so much	after watching this movie , i was a bit disappointed . i mean , the movie was OK , but it doesn't compare to the book , which i found riveting . the movie is set During WWII , and is basically about the British code breakers who were continually trying to break the code of the Enigma machine , which is how the Germans communicated with each other . there is some fine acting here , by Dougray Scott , Kate Winslet , Saffron Burrows and Jeremy Northam , and many others . there a few moments of tension and suspense , but mostly the movie is all about the drama . there is also a love story angle here . this is not some big Hollywood blockbuster version of events . this is a small , independent film . it is based on true events , and i believe it is probably fairly accurate . it's taken from the book by Robert Harris . i highly recommend the book , but if you read it first you , will likely be disappointed in the movie . my vote for Enigma :
473638	11423174	211181	5.0	a pale imitation of it's predecessor	unfortunately , this second live action film is a pale imitation of its predecessor . it's a lot slower , and the story feels contrived . it almost seems like filler to me . there are a few comic moments , though not as many as its predecessor . i think they should have left it at the first one , 101 Dalmatians . Glenn Close returns as Cruella De Vil , and is good , but has much less to do this time around . plus , her two henchmen form th preventions film are not in this one , and they added some comic relief . Gerard Depardieu is in this one , in a completely ridiculous role , and he looks quite silly , to be polite . despite its problems its still watchable . my vote for 102 Dalmations is a
472621	11423174	78869	5.0	mild Disney flick	and i do mean mild . this movie reminded me , in a lot of ways , of the 1960's show Lost in Space . the acting was similar , the characters seemed similar , the special effects seemed similar . the dialogue was pretty bad at times . or at least i thought it was . the one really good effect was the black hole itself . it looked really magnificent . otherwise , though , you could tell it was a Disney flick by the cheesiness of the rest of the special effects . the movie did have some mild comic relief in it . the musical score was actually pretty decent . the only problem was that it seemed ill timed . it would be in scenes were it wasn't necessary . as for the acting , some of it seemed hammy . overall , though , this wasn't a bad movie . just don't expect too much in the way of excitement . for me , The Black Hole is a
473860	11423174	404390	5.0	action packed , yet lacking	running scared is non-stop action from the get go . it is entertaining , but seemed to be missing something , though i can't say what . this movie did not really distinguish itself from others of the genre . there is nothing new here , and maybe that's what's missing . the movie could have benefited if there had been a twist of some sort . as it is this is standard action movie . i did like the touches of humour sprinkled throughout , which was good because the movie is so dark in tone . i realize the filmmakers were probably going for realism , but it wasn't necessary to have a much swearing as they did , particularly the f-bomb . the acting was good , though not brilliant by any stretch . i did think that vera farmiga was excellent in the small role that she had . the humorous parts in the movie reminded me of ( oddly enough ) of " analyze this " , a comedy which ironically i did not like . though i liked running scared , it could have been a better movie , certainly without so much foul language . if you are easily offended by strong language , you might want to stay away from this movie . it is also quite violent , though no more than any other movie of its type . not for everybody
472910	11423174	78856	5.0	the plot is thinner than shaved ham , but the movie is actually quite fun	it took awhile for me to get into this movie . but somewhere along the line , i actually started to enjoy myself . once you get around the wafer thin plot , it's not half bad . the trick with this movie is to not take it too seriously . for instance , as soon as the bad guys show up , you know they're bad long before they reveal their intentions . the only other thing they could have done to telegraph they were bad would have been to have been for them each to have a neon sign over their heads saying villain . it's that absurd . and there's some cringe worthy dialogue . however , the are some very witty one liners mostly courtesy of Sally Field , and their was an interesting , and ( mostly ) likable mix of characters . there were actually even a few exciting moments . of course , there are endless explosions . this movie doesn't hold a candle to the original Poseidon Adventure . it was actually fairly pointless , when you think about . but it was fun , and actually quite entertaining . for me , Beyond the Poseidon adventure is a solid
473927	11423174	374102	5.0	not my cup of tea ( )	this film has the ' based on true events ' tag . i guess things could have happened the way they were shown in the movie , but i'm guessing it would be rare . it's basically about two people who are left behind in the ocean after their dive tour boat accidentally leaves without them . that's the gist of the story . there's some scenes before of the couple before their tour , showing them at home and then at their hotel room , but to me , theses scenes weren't really necessary . but then again , the movie is only around 80 minutes long , so i guess they wanted to stretch out the running time . i just wanted them to get right to point of the couple in the ocean , as they tried to survive . ironically , for me , when the movie gets to that point , i found it boring and slow . there is some dialogue between the two , but i didn't think it was all that compelling . plus , the setting is the same the whole time . generally , i can't say i liked the film that much . after awhile , i just wanted it to be over . form me , Open Water is a
473059	11423174	192071	5.0	i liked the first half	it thought the first half of this film was pretty good . instead of being your standard teen romantic comedy , it actually had some slapstick thrown in , some of which was quite amusing . to me , that was kinda different for this genre . at least it was something i hadn't seen before . not that that means anything . and the movie also had a bit of a musical bent to it , which i liked . sure , most of the movie is fairly predictable . but then most movies are , at least to a point . anyway , the movie moves along fairly well for the first 45 minutes or so . but then it gets really bogged down . you kinda know how things are gonna end up , but it seemed to take forever to get there . as a result , i just wanted it to finally end . for me , because of the slow ( and to me , boring ) second half , i can only give Get Over It a
473872	11423174	414951	5.0	not what i expected	this movie is not what i expected . it wasn't horrible but i didn't think it was great either . i found most of the movie way too depressing and it didn't seem to have a point . it gets a bit better toward the end , but i still found it lacking . i think it tried too hard to be profound , and for me , it didn't succeed . i also found the acting not that great , but it also got better toward the end . i think many critics seem to think that the more depressing a movie is , the better it is . or at least many seem to give ratings that reflect that . to me , that doesn't make sense . but the opposite also seems true ( though not always ) . if a movie is light hearted and entertaining it gets a lower rating because there is not some deep profound meaning behind it . i mentioned that i didn't see the point to this movie . i say that because it seemed liked it was trying to be deep and meaningful . if that is a movies intent , then it should more clearly reflect that . and in this case , it doesn't seem to . For me " The Quiet " is a
472718	11423174	303929	6.0	brilliant ending , plus Rutger Hauer as Dracula , elevate this movie	this sequel to Dracula II : Ascension , which is sort of a sequel to Dracula 2000 , has much more story than either of the other tow . almost too much , in fact . it moves at a pretty slow pace , then , just when you think you can bear no more , something interesting happens to keep you watching . Two of the main characters from Dracula II are more fleshed out , and there is a wee bit of humour to lighten things up on one or two rare occasions . near the end , when i thought it was over , i was thinking how anti climatic it all was . but i realized it wasn't quite over , and the actual ending is brilliant . it begs for a sequel , which is not likely to happen . and yet , it's also a perfect conclusion . the ending ( well , that and Rutger Hauer as Dracula - - a stroke of genius ) is what elevated the move for me . otherwise , i would have given this 2 or 3 stars less . as it stands , i give Dracula III : Legacy a
473902	11423174	112864	6.0	Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson team up	of the first three Die Hard movies , i liked this , the third one , the least . i think manly because there wasn't very much action , but i also didn't like the story . i just thought there was too much going on . plus , i found the movie too long . it wasn't any longer than the first two movies , but i didn't feel the pacing was very good . plus , this movie doesn't really do a lot to distinguish itself from other movies of the genre . i did like Sam Jackson is his role as a shopkeeper who ends up helping John McClane . i thought he was funny and a good fit for Bruce Willis . i also thought Jeremy Irons was good as the man villain . Graham Greene is good too , in his role as a cop . This movie is missing Bonnie Bedelia , who played McClane's wife in the firs two movies . even though she didn't have that big a role in the other two films , i thought she was great with what she had . anyway , this isn't a bad movie by any means , but it's just not as good as number two , and nowhere near as good as the first one . for me Die Hard : With a Vengeance is a
472765	11423174	36872	6.0	the less famous prequel to The Bells of St . Mary's	this is the prequel ( and less famous cousin ) to The Bells of St . Mary's . it's basically about a priest named Father O'Malley who is assigned to a new Parish which is struggling financially , in hopes to turn its fortunes around . of course , there's more to that to the story , but i won't give it away here . Bing Crosby plays O'Malley , who is filled with the eternal hope and optimism of youth , and has a way with people . and he also sings . Crosby's voice is smooth as silk to begin with , and once he sings , it's pretty hard not to be affected . some of the songs tend to be bit long and a bit maudlin , and things move slowly at times . overall , though this a pleasant 125 minute diversion . and i found it very touching . i even teared up a couple times . for me , Going my Way is a
473315	11423174	338094	6.0	decent family fare	this Eddie Murphy movie is actually pretty good . it's funny , spooky and mysterious . the title pretty much says what it's about . basically , Murphy's character and his family are drawn into a mystery involving an old , obviously haunted mansion . i thought Jennifer Tilly was very funny here . it's PG rated movie , so it's suitable for most viewers . there maybe a few scenes a bit too intense for very young viewers . other than that , it's clean viewing entertainment . it's got a current low rating of 4 . 8 , which i don't happen to agree with at all . it may not be Eddie Murphy's finest hour , but so what . it's a decent family movie that kids and most adults should enjoy too . my rating for The Haunted mansion is
473694	11423174	462499	6.0	war really is hell	at first , i didn't like this movie too much , but as it went along , somewhere along the line i ended up liking it . this fourth and final installment of the series shows a softer gentler side of John Rambo , who just really wants to live in peace , like always . but , he is pulled into a war which was not his . this , better than any of the other Rambo movies , demonstrates that war really is hell . the human cost is the worst . the body count in this one is higher than in the previous movies , and the violence is way more brutal and graphic . we're talking body parts flying all over the place , decapitations , disembowelment . this to me , is the saddest and most tragic chapter in the Rambo series . but the story has more depth than the last two , and the human element is very strong here . i wouldn't say this was an enjoyable movie because there is too much death and destruction for it to be enjoyed . i think this movie was made to teach us a lesson . whether it succeeds or not is another story . for me , Rambo is a
472652	11423174	338095	6.0	decent horror movie with a few leaps of logic	high tension is a pretty decent movie , as horror movies go . it has some tension , and some suspense and their are a few scenes that will get your adrenaline rushing . it also has some pretty brutal violence . the acting was good and the film was very atmospheric when it needed to be . i do have a few complaints , however . one is that the version i watched alternated between English subtitles and dubbed English throughout the movie , which was quite annoying . there are some inconsistencies of course , but that is to be expected in a horror movie . also , you have to dispense with logic , again normal in a horror movie . on the plus side high tension didn't have the usual unintentional laughs found in most horror movies . a very rare trait , indeed . all in all , high tension was a fairly decent horror movie . , which my friend and both enjoyed .
472793	11423174	118617	6.0	mostly entertaining and fun but should have a " PG " rating instead of " G "	this animated movie is pretty good , all things considered . i thought it was funny at times , but i thought there were too many musical numbers for my taste . also , the movie is rated " G " and i think it should have been rated " PG " . there are a few scenes which i think might be a bit too intense for young children . the villain may be a bit too scary . i also thought the movie dragged a bit too much at times , though i did like the look of the film . it was very colourful and nice to look at . i'm not sure how historically accurate it is , but if that's what you look for in a movie , you should probably stick to documentaries . i thought the voice actors fit their characters well , which really helps in an animated movie . to me , this was a pretty good movie overall , though i don't think it was a masterpiece . it was mostly entertaining and fun , but again , parents should use their discretion for this one . for me , " Anastasia " is a
473036	11423174	66049	6.0	authentic portrayal of the Sioux Indians of the time	at the beginning of this movie , there is a blurb about how the events portrayed are taken directly from historical documents of the period . the South Dakota Sioux Indians also had a lot of input into the movie . so , we can assume it is fairly accurate . one thing it does is show the Native American Indians as being just like any other people . this movie took awhile to get going , in my mind , but once it does , it's action packed , and it's very well acted . Richard Harris is the title character . he is a British Lord who is captured by the Sioux in the mid 1800's . first he is treated with disdain , as nothing more than a servant to the aging mother of the chief . gradually , though , things change , though , and he becomes much more . this is a very touching and heart breaking movie . it's also very thought provoking . overall , i give A Man Called Horse a
473577	11423174	102945	6.0	so so movie made better by lead performances	i guess this movie is OK . it's about a woman who meets the man of her dreams . they get married and everything seems perfect . four years later , things appear great . then , things start to unravel , slowly at first . hubby becomes manipulative and controlling , and then verbally and physically abusive . wife escapes his clutches , moves to new town , changes identity , new job , etc . then hubby tracks wife , swears revenge for her leaving , vows to kill her . that's the gist of the story , although there's a bit more going on , but i won't give it away . Julia Roberts plays the wife and Patrick Bergin plays the psycho husband . both are good in their respective roles , but the movie itself is lacking any real intensity and even though the wife is in danger , i just never really felt her jeopardy . in fact i found the movie boring and slow . i think that had more to do with the writing than the acting . this movie is standard for this genre , not that great , but there are worse . the performances of the two leads are enough to elevate the movie . so instead of , i give " Sleeping with the Enemy "
473495	11423174	105156	6.0	not bad , has its moments	i guess this movie is OK . it has a few good moments , but it's generally pretty slow . it is watchable for sure , but given the premise i thought they could have developed the story and the characters more . for me , the villain in the movie is a bit weak , which is something i really wish they had worked on a bit more . a stronger villain would have elevated the movie . one thing's for sure , it is a weird movie . i really like the music . it's suitably sombre . the acting is good , for what the actors had to work with . i also like the dark tone of the movie . overall though , i guess i was a little disappointed . the story had so much potential which the movie barely hinted at . for me , Poison Ivy is a
473380	11423174	248667	6.0	a career performance by Will Smith ( too bad the movie is sub standard )	this film about Muhammad Ali is a disappointing effort . it's over long , boring at times and lacking much intensity . the movie is all flash and no substance . Will Smith though is very brilliant in the title role . he inhabits Ali's body and soul . the problem is , the movie is not worthy of his huge talent . it does have its moments , but really it has an empty incomplete feel to it . after it was over , i was left unsatisfied . this movie should have been great , but there's something missing . though Smith exudes heart , soul and intensity , the movie has neither . i had such high hopes for this one . the irony of it all , is this may well be Smith's greatest performance so far , that i have witnessed . he really put on an acting clinic . even though the movie fails to impress , i recommend for those that want to see what real acting is . as a result , i give " Ali "
473324	11423174	102984	6.0	Much better than i thought it would be ( worth the 2 hours )	this is a surprisingly entertaining movie . it won't win any awards for originality . this plot line has been used several times , sometimes to better effect , sometimes not . as a matter of fact , Charlie Sheen would star in pretty much the same movie , Beyond the Law , one year later ( 1992 ) . both are comparable efforts . any way , in Stone Cold Brian Bosworth , an ex football player , takes on the role of of the undercover cop . He does a surprisingly admirable job . it's strange that his film career didn't take off , as his acting ability equals ( probably surpasses ) that of Stallone and Shwarzennegger when they started out . He is certainly better than Van Damme . Lance Henrickson is well cast as the chief bad guy in the film . action abounds in this movie , leaving pretty much no dramatic moments . of course in most movies of this type , there is zero character development , but that can be forgiven in this case . the movie knows what it is and doesn't try to be something it's not . it is pure fun . oh , yeah , i almost forgot . William Forsythe also plays a baddie and is brilliant as always . this is definitely a great way to entertain yourself for 2 hours .
472960	11423174	97647	6.0	weakest of the original trilogy	this movie is hands down , the worst of the original 3 . the writing is seriously lacking in this one . the story is weak an not compelling . the protagonist is weaker than the previous 2 , by a mile . this whole movie is anticlimactic . very little happens over the course of the film . Basically , Kreese , from the original movie wants revenge on Daniel and Mr Myagi for events that happened during the beginning of the 2nd movie . there is very little wisdom or philosophy dispensed by Myagi in this 1 . the ending is weak and anti-climatic , to say the least . if you do decide to watch Karate Kid 3 , you should watch the previous 2 first , otherwise you might not quite understand what is happening . it is unfortunate that they had to end the trilogy on such a low note . maybe they just couldn't come up with anything better . in which case , they should't have bothered . The movie is watchable , even entertaining at times , but does not live up to The Karate Kid name .
473092	11423174	105179	6.0	the most eerie and suspenseful of the four	to me , this movie is the best of the four . it's the most suspenseful and creepy . the story has a mostly religious bent to it , and of course there is the Latin chanting which comes with these movies . for me , i find that very eerie , to say the least . the music is quite eerie , as well . the suspense in this movie is quite high . to me , it became almost unbearable at times . the idea of a fanatical nut thinking it is their job to cleanse people of sin ( by killing them ) isn't really new or original today . it wasn't really original back in 1991 when this movie was released . but , for me , it worked in this case . . while this is no masterpiece , i did like it . one thing i didn't like was the potty mouth of one of the female characters . i just didn't think it was necessary . for me , Prom Night IV : Deliver us From Evil is a
472869	11423174	47795	6.0	better viewed when not sleep deprived ( as i was )	i just finished watching this movie ( sort of ) and it just failed to hold my interest for more than few moments at time . to be fair though , i hadn't slept all night , so might have influenced things . i did however get the bulk of the story , which in nutshell , involves Abott and Costello meeting a Mummy in Egypt . a lot of the film involves sight gags , such as Abbot repeatedly slapping Costello for something stupid he says or does . after hearing Abott insult Costello for the umpteenth time , i sort of wondered why they even hung out together . silly , i know , but that's what i kept thinking . Costello constantly screaming Abott's name whenever he perceived he was in trouble got a bit grating . there is also a lot of ( pointless , i thought ) running around crazily . there is one particular sequence which i found very ridiculous ( not in a good way ) involving a dead body being moved from room to room each time Costello stumbles upon it . naturally , he runs screaming in hysterics to Abott , telling him he found a dead body . just as naturally , it is never where he saw it . this should have been funny , but wasn't . i also felt they just seemed to be doing the same shtick over and over ad nausiam . yet the movie wasn't boring , just sort of beige . i have listened to many of Abbott and Costello's radio shows and find them much funnier . but i will view this film again under more optimal viewing conditions and maybe i will have a much more positive experience . for now ,
473751	11423174	73760	6.0	absurd , and fun	i liked this movie . it's typical Disney silliness of that era , but it is fun and goofy , even absurd . there's a lot of overacting , but so what . this was supposedly a Kurt Russel vehicle , but it's really an ensemble cast . i liked Caesar Romero the most though . the story is simple . a college student discover a strength formula , and things go from there . if you're looking for high art , you won't find it here , but if you want something that's family friendly viewing , with a few amusing moments , this might be your movie . Kurt Russel starred in a lot of these silly Disney movies , starting as a teenager , and yet still manged to become a serious actor as an adult . anyway , for me , The Strongest Man in the World is a for me .
473039	11423174	819129	6.0	entertaining TV movie as good as some of the Hollywood drivel which passes as entertainment	as made for TV movies go , this one is not bad . not great , but not bad . to be honest , i don't mind most TV movies . true , they are very predictable , and most so called plot twists can be figured out by a 3 year old . having said , they can be entertaining . that pretty much describes " Thrill of the Kill " . here's the basic plot outline . Kelly Holden ( Shiri Appleby-Swim Fan , The TV series Roswel ) can not let go of her sister's murder , which happened a year ago . She believes she can find out who the killer is . She enlists the help of murder mystery novelist Graydon Jennings ( Chris Pottter-Kung Fu : the Legend Continues , Silk Stalkings ( 10 episodes ) who happens to be in her town for a book signing . Because all of his novels are written from the point of view of the killer , she believes he may have some valuable insight . Naturally , there are more than a few suspects , but it is pretty easy to figure out the killer , way before the movie ends . Both Appleby and Potter are decent actors who do well with what they have . the movie is an entertaining 88 min diversion , which is probably all it sets out to be . Many people are critical of TV movies , sometimes referred to as the " movie of the weak " . they are criticized for having basically the same plot , just different actors . this is true , but it is also true of much of the crap that is churned out for the big screen by Hollywood . there is certainly very little creativity there . the only difference may be bigger budget , big name actors and sometimes special effects , all designed to woo the viewer into thinking they're seeing something new . in other words , disguising the fact that they are watching the same old thing each time ( yes , there are exceptions ) . add to that the fact that these big screen movies are actually trying to be creative or at least think they are . now , with the so called movies of the week , the filmmakers and actors know what their product is and don't try to make it anything more than it is . so , the above criticisms of TV movies are not valid . generally a movie of this sort deserves a unless it is woefully worse than any other movie . since Thrill of the Kill is no worse than other TV movie and as good as some of the drivel that the big Machine spews out , this one also gets a
473478	11423174	93300	6.0	wafer thin premise , but much better than # 3	this is the fourth and final installment in the " Jaws " franchise . this movie is not as bad as the third one . in fact it is much better . the only problem with this movie is its wafer thin premise . you really have to suspend your belief for this one . not that you didn't need to for the third one , but this one takes it to another level entirely . if you can get around that , you might enjoy this movie . it goes back to the roots of the first two and utilizes what worked the first time . there's more action in this one , not really alt of suspense to speak of though . there is however , some humour , in the form of Michael Caine as Hoagie / an island pilot , among other things . Mario Van Peebles also provides some laughs as Jake , a graduate student working in the field of marine life study . this movie does have its slow spots , but it manges to pickup before becoming too tedious . overall , i'd have to give " Jaws : The Revenge "
472655	11423174	433383	6.0	Edward . R Murrow vs senator Joseph McCarthy	i just watched good night , and good luck , which is about CBS newsman Edward R . Murrow and his fight against senator Joseph McCarthy , a junior senator from Wisconsin , during the 1950's . this was a time of hysteria regarding communists and communist sympathizers in America and anyone else who may have had dealings with them . it was basically a time where anyone who was deemed a threat to national security was targeted by senator McCarthy and others in hearings held against them . many of these people lost their jobs or worse based on little or no evidence against them . that is the premise of the movie good night and good luck . it is based on a true story , but you have to take it with a grain of salt as it is biased on the side of Edward R . Murrow and other people who share his view and opinions . obviously it is slanted towards the view of the people who made the film . so you really have to make up your own mind about how accurate it might or might not be . however , as simply a movie , it is very entertaining , with great performances all around from an ensemble cast . it is well directed and shooting it in black and white was very effective . at times however , it was preachy , which was annoying , and i'm still not sure why Murrow ended each broadcast with the words " good night and good luck " and i found that a bit annoying . i would have liked the filmmakers to give an explanation for those words , maybe show the genesis behind them and give them more meaning , put them into context . i'm not saying whether the movie was accurate or not , and can only rate it for it's entertainment value as well as its technical merit . overall , the film was well made , with a good eye for detail of the era , and it had a very authentic feel about it . it was well paced with crisp dialogue and for a drama it was better done than many films of the genre . it was at times engaging , yet not quite riveting . the only other complaint i have is that it could have had more substance and been a bit more in-depth . otherwise , i enjoyed it .
473589	11423174	318649	6.0	lite mindless , entertaining fare	i didn't mind this movie . it's pretty lite fare , but enjoyable . the movie is based on a novel by Clive Cussler and centers around thrill seeking adventurer Dirk Pitt ( Matthew McConaughey ) and his travelling companion ( Steve Zahn ) . the duo find themselves in over their heads and trying to avoid being killed by enemies they have made on their latest treasure hunt . they end up teaming with a humanitarian aid doctor , played by Penelope cruse . McConaughey and Zahn make a good pair , and work well off each other . they each have some funny lines . cruse was OK , though i am not a fan of hers . the movie is fast paced and has some thrills . it's funny at times , but it is also unrealistic to the point of absurdity . my eyes got a workout from rolling back in my head so much . also the movie feels incomplete somehow . there was great potential and i think they could have made a great movie . nevertheless , for mindless entertainment , you could do worse . for me , Sahara is a
473060	11423174	212235	6.0	one of the more entertaining teen / horror spoofs	my personal feeling is that this movie is better than any of the Scary Movie Films . i found it more relevant and clever . it is better paced , with no real spots that lag . the jokes do fly literally about every few seconds . i woudn't say it is funny , but there are some very amusing moments . i particularly liked the end stages of the film . to me , this film is lighter in tone than the Scary Movie franchise . it's also not as gross . the violence is also less graphic , and the language is much tamer . there is very little in the way of nudity , and most of the sexual situations are implied . the movie is rated R , but i'm not sure why . after watching it , i thought it would be PG-1 , at most . i checked the rating after watching , and i'm really surprised . from my viewpoint , i think this movie would be suitable for most kids 13 or older , but parents should use their discretion , of course . either way , i thought this movie was pretty entertaining all the way through . it's no masterpiece , but i give this movie a
473806	11423174	279573	6.0	from the people who brought you The F . B . I . Files	from the same people who brought you The F . B . I . Files comes this series about the high tech aspects of solving crime ( such as the use of DNA and fingerprinting ) as well as forensic anthropology and psychological profiling . for me , this series is much slower than the F . BI . Files and less interesting . it is much more dramatic , with less action . and i found it much darker in tone than the F : B : I : Files . it gets more in depth into the science of crime detection , and less on the crime itself . i found this aspect a bit dry at times . still , it is well made and at times compelling . certainly if you're into the scientific aspect of crime and crime solving , you should check this series out . in North America , seasons 1 & 2 are available as one collection . for me , The Detectives is a
472568	11423174	66194	6.0	good sequel	this sequel to the original movie was a bit better , i thought . the story was more interesting , and there were more funny moments . there is less action than the first one , but that didn't make much difference to me . the same characters are back . ( Nash Crawford ) Walter Brennan , ( Jason Fitch ) Edgar Buchanan , Amos Polk ( Andy Devine ) and Gentleman George Agnew ( Chill Wills ) are all in good form here , but it is the addition of Fred Astaire which makes the movie . Astaire steals the show , in my opinion . like the first movie , this one is a lot of fun , and suitable for most family members , probably anyone 10 or older . for me , The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again is a
473100	11423174	45815	6.0	some entertaining song and dance numbers , but virtually no story	this is pure musical , with virtually no story , but it's actually pretty fun . there are some pretty entertaining songs and dance numbers . some of the songs , though , i felt were a bit overdone . if you're not in to musicals , you might want to skip this one . if you're a musical fan , you might like it . the characters are all very likable , and the movie is all ages appropriate . there's nothing offensive at all . it moves along at a good pace . you might feel satisfied while watching . the only thing is , i don't feel it was that memorable . after it's over you'll probably forget about it pretty quickly . but it is entertaining while watching , so i'll give The Girl Next Door a
473857	11423174	78295	6.0	John Carpenter's third film	while i admit there is lots of tension in this movie , it's almost too much . the problem i found is that ( to me at least ) the movie keeps building to a climax which is less exciting than the rest of the movie . there is one pretty thrilling moment in the movie , but for me , that's about it . this is by no means a bad movie . in fact , think it was very well done and the acting is top rate . i just felt it was too drawn out . this is John carpenter's third picture , and was intended for the big screen at one point . but somewhere along the line , it was decided to make it into a TV movie . it's not overly violent and certainly not very graphic . even though i thought the movie was drawn out , it was still entertaining enough o watch until the end . if you don't mind a really slow build up , you will probably enjoy this one . by the way , this movie also available as part of the Twisted Terror collection , which also includes five other horror movies . anyway , for me , Someone's Watching Me is a
472912	11423174	422774	6.0	a bit funnier than Are We There yet ?	i thought this sequel to Are We There Yet was pretty good . it's a bit funnier . it's based on the classic movie Mr . Blandings builds his dream House , but it also has a lot of the Money Pit thrown in . John C . McGinley is very funny in his role . i don't want to say what that role is , because that would be spoiling things . but trust me , he's pretty funny . as with the first movie , this one is predictable , so there's no surprise how it will end . there's a bit of innuendo here , but no bad language . i'm surprised at the low rating ( ) which in my mind is nowhere near fair . for me , this is a movie that is pretty much good for the whole family . i give Are We Done Yet ? a
473540	11423174	780583	6.0	zombie free for all !	this is one of the gorier zombie flicks i have seen in a while . it takes awhile to get to that point , though . once it does , it basically becomes barely controlled chaos , mayhem and carnage . this is not a big budget movie by any stretch , but i think it's played as camp , more than anything , so the low budget doesn't really matter . there are some very funny scenes , which i think are intentional . the movie is never boring . it's even fun at times . the acting won't win any awards , but basically , it's just a zombie free for all , so there isn't really a lot of acting required . if you can get around the absurd premise , and if you're a gore hound , this could be the movie for you . for me , even though i enjoyed it , there were some moments that were a bit too sick for me . as a result , i would have to give Flight of the Living Dead : Outbreak on a Plane a
472744	11423174	118688	6.0	campy but funny at times . probably won't leave much of an impact after watching though	i suppose you could say this movie is the low point in the franchise . i mean , while watching the movie i kept thinking it was basically a two hour movie of the 1960's camp classic classic with Adam west and Burt Ward . i found it hard to take the movie very seriously , considering there were so many one liners , most of them corny , but some quite funny . also the movie was very special effects laden , to say the least . the characters all seemed to be just parodies of themselves . George Clooney Donned the cape for this incarnation , and i have to agree with another reviewer who said he seemed to be playing George Clooney . i don't think he had quit the right look for Batman , but then again , neither did the movie . there were some good things about the movie . Uma Thurman was one , in the role of villainess Poison Ivy . she looked great and i loved her accent . i found it strangely seductive . Alicia Silverstone Played BatGirl . she looked good in her skintight outfit . she's cute too . Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin , and once again , i really loved the look of his suit at the beginning , not so much the one he had later in the film . i didn't like Batman's costume too much at all . i thought it just looked silly . oh , yeah , Arnie was in this one and received top billing as the evil genius Mr Freeze . basically he just fired his gun at everything and everyone and froze whatever was in his way . they even imagined to make arkham asylum look non foreboding . this whole new look Batman may have been the point to the movie . maybe it was all deliberate , but i think if that's the case , the experiment backfired . people hated this movie . i didn't hate it . i found it entertaining but very light as far as Batman goes . guess i would give it a just for entertainment value .
472814	11423174	93409	6.0	Mel Gibson and Danny Glover team up	i thought this movie was not bad . it teams Mel Gibson and Danny Glover together as two cops who couldn't be more different , and end up partnering with each other . both hate having partners . Martin Riggs ( Gibson ) is a loose cannon who likes to bend the roles , and who just might be suicidal and / or homicidal . Roger Murtaugh is older , more conservative , and likes to do things by the book . i wouldn't say the movie is action packed , but it does seem to move at a fairly decent pace . i wouldn't say it's that funny , either , although it is classified as an action / comedy . still , i've seen a lot worse in the genre . Gary Busey has a nice turn as a bad guy . when all is said and done , Lethal weapon is a
473042	11423174	112641	6.0	Nowhere near as good as it reputation ( but entertaining , nonetheless )	well , i finally got around to watching Martin Scorsese's " Casino " tyhis one has some big names , but to be honest the only standout performance was by Sharon Stone " she runs the gamut of emotions in this one . i won't give any of it away , however . The rest of the actors are okay in their respective roles . Joe Pesci makes sure everyone knows he can skillfully add the f-word into nearly every sentence at least once . that is a dubious distinction and not really an impressive one . after awhile , it just gets annoying . credit that to Nicholas Pileggi , who wrote the script and co-wrote the screenplay ( with Scorsese ) , based on his novel . anyway , considering how much this movie has been praised over the years , i expected something approaching spectacular . it is not spectacular , in any sense of the word . it is a good movie that is entertaining and well paced , given its nearly 3 hour running time . but a disappointment if you are expecting a movie that will knock your socks off and remain with you for days . i just watched it , and it's already fading from memory . keep your expectations low for this one , and you won't be too disappointed .
473208	11423174	80130	6.0	fairly decent horror / suspense	the last time i watched this movie , i didn't care for it at all . this time , however , i actually didn't think it was too bad . it's kind of slow at times , and a bit drawn out . i think they also reveal too much , leaving less to the imagination . i also think Carol Kane seems too old to be the teenage babysitter , but that's just me . she is not a bad actress , she just doesn't do it for me in this movie . having said all that , the movie is suspenseful , with very good music and a very eerie tone to it . i actually enjoyed it for the most part . if you watch this movie and enjoy it , you might also like the sequel " when a Stranger Calls Back , which i thought was a better movie . you might also like " black Christmas " , which is very similar , but actually came out in 1974 , 5 years before " When a Stanger Calls " . i'd also recommend the recent remake of " . . . Stranger . . . " , which i also thought was a better movie . As for this movie . i think it deserves a strong
473411	11423174	105085	6.0	effective and entertaining black comedy	" Paint Job " is a wry , black comedy about a painter who pursues his boss's wife . his boss as it turns out is a serial killer in their small town . this movie is amusing at times , always entertaining and always bizarre the film is populated with an assortment of quirky ( to say the least ) characters . in fact there is no one in the film who can be described as normal . Wil Patton is Wesley , the painter who falls for his boss's wife . Bebe Neuwirth plays the wife , and Robert Pastorelli plays the boss / serial killer . the movie is subtle in its humour , more ironic than anything , and absurd at times . i particularly liked Neuwirth's performance as the somewhat dim wife , although all the performances were good . i did not have any expectations going in , so was pleasantly surprised at how effective and entertaining the film was . if you expect to be rolling around in hysterics , look elsewhere . otherwise , prepare to be amused and entertained . a strong
473051	11423174	110725	6.0	entertaining , though typical Seagal fare	this is typical Steven Seagal fare . it's really just an excuse for Seagal to show how good he is in beating people up . there is , naturally , a great deal of action , and lots of fight scenes . problem is , the fight scenes are nothing we haven't seen before . there are a lot of fancy camera tricks , but so what ? there are two added element , one of which is an environmental storyline . the other is the casting of Michael Cane as the main bad guy . if nothing else , Caine adds some class to the proceedings . the cast also includes Joan Chen , R . Lee Emery , and Billy Bob Thornton . so at least it has some decent actors . Caine in particular impressed me . it thought he made a pretty convincing bad guy . Seagal also attempts to act here , but really most people watch a Seagal flick to see him beat up other people , sometimes more than one a at time , and come out with barley a mark on him . if you're a Seagal fan , you'll probably like this entry . it's nothing new , really . despite it's problems , though , i did find it entertaining . for me on Deadly ground is a
473207	11423174	41866	6.0	the second film in John Ford's Cavalry " trilogy "	i was a bit disappointed in this movie . for me , it is not as good as Fort Apache , the first film in John Ford's Cavalry " trilogy " . i still liked it , but i thought it was a bit slow at times , and it doesn't have a lot of action . plus , i would have preferred if John Wayne's character Captain Nathan Brittles had more of a conflict with another officer , like his character in Fort Apache . there , his character had a conflict with Henry Fonda's character , a superior officer . that sort of added another dimension to the movie . this movie lacked the comic bits of Apache , which disappointed me a bit . it is a much more serious movie , to be sure . still , this isn't a bad movie and it is in colour . my vote for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is a
473396	11423174	120783	6.0	has more heart than the original	this remake of the 1961 version is actually a pretty decent movie . i found it engaging and high energy . the characters had some personality and depth to them , especially the mother and father , played By Dennis Quad and Natasha Richardson . as well , the story has some heart , and is very touching . also , this is the film debut of Lindsay Lohan , who was 11 at the time , and steals the show . she plays the twins , and is very engaging , convincing and likable . this version is almost the same as the remake , but the story is a bit expanded , and the movie is a bit more fun . at least i though so . it's a family friendly film , and adults should be entertained as well . my vote for the 1998 version of The Parent Trap :
473764	11423174	83907	6.0	works well for what it is	A while back , i did review of Evil Dead 2 , which called absolute garbage . well , i stand by that review . however , it is only fair to give a review of its predecessor , so here goes . " Evil Dead " is a pretty decent movie , offering up some genuine chills . one particularly effective scene involved one of the female characters and half of the woods come to life . the acting was decent . with no hammy overacting which is what plague its successor . there was not much comedy in this movie . it was played pretty straight , and was effective for the most part . the plot was pretty straight forward although bizarre to say the least . the demons were quite revolting . this was a low budget movie , but that did not detract from the overall feel . creepy , to be sure . i think this movie was effective because it didn't try to be something it was not . it is not a masterpiece , nor does it try to be one . i enjoyed it a quite a bit .
473057	11423174	105428	6.0	not spectacular , but entertaining	this Stephen King adaptation was entertaining but not great , by any means . it's worthwhile to pass time . it''s probably as weird as any of the King adaptation i have , and even weirder than others . this movie sort of felt like a fairy tale to me . although not a kid's fable , obviously . i did like the cast , many of whom have gone on to other things , since then . Brian Krause also appeared in the TV show Charmed , Madchen Amick ( who could be Kim Delaney's twin sister ) has been in several smaller budget pictures . Alice Krige was seen most notably as the Borg Queen in Star Trek : First Contact , while Ron Perlman was previously seen in The TV series beauty and the Beast . his most notable role ( In my opinion ) was in Hellboy as the title character . like in most King movies , king himself appears in a cameo . at least three other modern horror masters ( Jon Landis , Joe Dante , and Clive Barker also have cameos . anyway if you wanna pass 90 minutes or so , i'd say this movie is worth it . for me , Sleepwalkers is a
473307	11423174	85811	6.0	a decent sword and sorcery / fantasy film	while this is not the best film of the sword and sorcery / fantasy genre , i did like it . i found it fast paced , and never boring . yet strangely , i never really found it exciting either . and there were some things about it i found absurd . many people will find the special effects quite quaint by today's standards , and i guess they are , although that didn't really bother me in this movie . i really liked the look of the film . i do think the that the story was a bit weak , and they could have added to it . the movie felt a bit incomplete at the end , in my mind . i did find the ending anti climatic . i found the acting to be understated , but good from all concerned . there have been a lot of similar movies since then ( and some before then ) some better , some worse . for me , this movie falls closer to the better category . the movie on the whole actually reminded me a lot of the 1938 version of Robin Hood , and i mean that in a good way . when you add it all up , i think Krull is about a
473313	11423174	105414	6.0	decent thriller	although this is a fairly decent psychological suspense thriller , it is predictable at times and a bit of reach in some scenes . still , anyone who's ever had a roommate who is even slightly unbalanced or worse can relate . Bridget Fonda is good as the normal roommate in the equation , but Jennifer Jason Leigh is perfectly cast as the roommate from hell . of course it helps if she has a character to work with . Steven Weber has a small roles as well . Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky also have small roles . the movie moves along pretty well most of the time but slows down occasionally , and nearly ruins the momentum at times . still , it's a good movie , as these movies go . for me , Single White female is a
473615	11423174	388125	6.0	two sisters learn to love each other and themselves	this is the story of two sisters who are polar opposites . Cameron Diaz is Maggie Feller , a free spirited loopy party girl with no life track . Toni Collette is rose , her older , wiser , Career oriented sister . the two clash about many things , especially Maggie's life style . They have a major blowout and Maggie Disappaers . Shirley Mac Laine Plays a prominent role in the movie , and is responsible for getting the sisters back together . of course before this happens both sisters must realize they need each other and learn other life lessons along the way . once reunited , they begin to understand each other and accept each other and themselves . another feel good , " lets all love one another " movie . preachy to be sure , but still entertaining . the life lessons the girls learn may be deep and profound but the movie itself is not . and it is certainly not original . this movie has been done ad infinitum and ad nauseum . but for a fluff piece , it is okay .
472643	11423174	76214	6.0	as these types of movies go , i've seen worse	you know , i didn't think this was all that bad , for this type of movie , ( man vs insect , nature , etc ) that is . i actually thought there were a few suspenseful moments . the acting wasn't horrible or anything . there are a lot of plot holes for sure , and as per usual in this type of movie , most of the characters are either stupid or do stupid things . the one thing i did like about this movie , compared to others of this genre , is that at least there was a character who was reprehensible and you could really hate . and you get the pleasure of seeing him eventually meet his much deserved end . i also thin the the reason for the ants killing people could be possible . it's at least in the realm of possibility . it's not very likely but you never know . i haven't seen all of the movies in this genre . but it's probably safe to say that none of them will be stellar in terms of quality and logic . still , i enjoyed this one for what it is , a mildly entertaining way to pass 90 minutes or so . i give " it Happened at Lakewood Manor " AKA " Ants "
473896	11423174	297120	6.0	not a bad sequel but way too long ( nearly 3 hours )	it's been a little while since i've seen this sequel to the 1984 original . however , i do remember that i really liked the girl who played the grown up version of Charlie . i thought she did well in the role . there's a lot more excitement in this one , i believe . it's much higher energy . again , the acting is serviceable , though the plot seems sillier than it did in the first movie . also , clocking in at nearly 3 hours running time is a real negative here . i think the story could have been told in much less time than that . they certainly could have shaved off an hour . but as sequels go ( other than the long running time ) this movie is not half bad . for me , Fire Starter 2 : Rekindled is a
473453	11423174	106689	6.0	strong on realism , just a bit too slow at times	i sort of liked this movie . it's about a crack team of government agents who must stop a madman who has hijacked a freight train and holds some of the crew hostage . complicating matters is that there is a nuclear bomb on board . that sounds like many other movies . and it is true , the premise is very familiar . the only difference here is that this movie is much more realistic . there not a lot of death defying stunts which strain believability . also , the characters act more like they would in this kind of situation . the bad guys are smarter than normal , usually a step ahead of the good guys . the good guys are more like real human beings . they make mistakes that you believe could really be made . they're not super human . i thought the cast was good for this movie . you have some really good actors here . Patrick Stewart is the head honcho of the agency , while Pierce Brosnan and Alexandra Paul are the two main agents . Ted Levine is the crazy in this one , along with Christopher Lee . i've always liked Patrick Stewart and Pierce Brosnan . both are very credible in their roles . but Alexandra Paul really impressed me here . i also liked the fact that her character was a strong woman , not a damsel in distress . the supporting cast was also very good . i also think the way they depicted events had some realism . i think the same thing could happen the same way in real life . having said all that , i have to say the movie was pretty slow , not quite too slow to watch , but pretty close . that's really the only complaint i have about the film . otherwise i didn't find too much wrong with it . that one little problem lowers the rating a bit though , from my point of view . for me " death Train " AKA " Detonator " is a
472737	11423174	151582	6.0	weird	this is one odd movie , and i don't mean that in a bad way . it's basically about drifter ( Owen Wilson ) who's a serial killer . the difference is he poisons his victims . the interesting thing is , it's hard to pin down what his motive is . the movie might have explained it , but the movie is so subtle , it's hard to get everything . it may require repeat viewings to understand everything , and even then , you may not understand it all . if you like action in your movies , you might want to stay clear of this one . it tends to move slow , but to me , it was just compelling enough to keep watching . i won't say this is a bad movie ( especially since i have just seen " Dracula 3000 " , the worst movie ever made ) but it's not for everyone . for me The Minus Man is a
472626	11423174	1174954	6.0	could have been better	this is the third movie i've watched today , and like the other two ( Bangkok Dangerous , and Traitor ) i find myself disappointed . this is the first CG animated full length Resident Evil film . i found the animation lacking . the character movements are jerky and the facial movements don't sync up with the body language . i also thought the story was lacking , and the action wasn't exactly stellar , in my mind . yet i was more entertained with this movie than either of Bangkok Dangerous or Traitor . i mean it is fairly fast paced . i just wish they could have had more of the characters from the previous Resident Evil films , and with the original voices . for me , Resident Evil : Degeneration is a
473730	11423174	485774	6.0	lots of blood in this one	this movie is about a psychopath who is executed by electric chair , but comes back to life . he leaves a trail of bodies in the hospital where he has been brought . this movie has a lot of kills , almost all of which are very bloody . but i didn't think any of the kills were any different than in most movies of this genre . the gut who played the psychopath was kinda creepy . the movie has some eerie moments , but nothing out of the ordinary , that i could see . if you are a gore hound , this might your movie . the movie is entertaining , but not really memorable . for me it doesn't have anything that stand out from other blood soaked flicks . the acting is okay for the genre . i give " Heart Stopper " based on all the blood .
472764	11423174	34862	6.0	decent comedy / musical	i thought this was a fun little musical / comedy . there's a number of song and and numbers , most of which i liked . it Stars Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire as friends , who are also rivals when it comes to women . there's some amusing banter between the two , and Astaire is quite a dancer . Crosby is the singer , and his voice is of course pure silk . there is one segment in the movie which which is offensive , and frankly in poor taste , and could be considered racist , but i don't think it was deliberately done in malice . this segment wouldn't be included in any modern movie , but unfortunately , they did things different back then . for me , that's the only black mark on the movie . otherwise , i thought it was good . for me , Holiday Inn is a
472525	11423174	348150	6.0	a bit of a letdown	considering the hype for this movie , i thought it would be better than it was . it wasn't a horrible movie , but i don't think it lived up to the Superman name . Brandon Routh as Superman , looked a lot like Christopher Reeve , maybe a bit too much . his mannerisms were also too much like Reeve , as if he were trying to emulate him , when instead he should have been trying to put his own stamp on the character . Kate Bosworth was okay as Loise lane , but Kevin Spacey was an inspired choice as Lex Luthor . i also liked Frank Langella as Perry White . however , i could have done without James Marsden as Richard White , especially since his role was so small it was pointless . the other problem i had with the movie is that it tended to lag at times , causing my attention to wander . this movie just didn't have the impact of a movie like spider man or even any of the x-men films . it just didn't have as much substance as it could have . if you've yet to see this movie , keep your expectations low and maybe you won't be overly disappointed .
473367	11423174	30273	6.0	second in The Shadow series of movies	this second movie in the Shadow series is no better or worst than the first one , in my opinion . Rod La Rocque is back as Lamont Cranston . however , in this one , Cranston plays a newspaper columnist , with a column called The Shadow Says and he hosts a short radio show running through the latest crime , as the voice of The Shadow . so if you're expecting Cranston to solve this case as The Shadow , or the Shadow to make an actual appearance you might be disappointed . in this movie Cranston solves another case , this time with the assistance of Phoebe Lane ( who works at the same newspaper ) who he meets while pondering the case . yes , i said Phoebe , not Margo . ( Margo Lane is Cranston's sidekick in the long running The Shadow radio program ) .
473252	11423174	99044	6.0	not as good as the original but still pretty decent	this sequel to 48 Hours has a much darker tone than the original . it's more violent , with probably even more very strong language . there is a bit less comedy , but the comic bits are a bit funnier than in the first one . the action is thorough the roof in this one . it's much more exciting . i liked the storyline more . it's more developed and a bit more complex . the plot isn't that original , but the movie is well executed . the movie is a bit too formulaic at times though . Eddie Murphy gets to show a little of his impression talent in this one . the dialogue , while pretty good for the most part , is at times overdone and a bit of a stretch . overall , i think this movie is pretty decent , but not quite as good as the first one . for me , Another 48 hours is a .
473581	11423174	478087	6.0	liked it , didn't love it	while i liked this movie , i didn't love it . it was entertaining , but not really very substantive . plus , while watching , i couldn't help but think i'd had seen the movie before , under a different title and with different actors . the name of said movie still escapes me . to be fair though , when you make a film centered around the subject of gambling , there's isn't too much you can do to distinguish one from another . i will say , though , that i thought Kevin Spacey was brilliant in his performance and Laurence Fishburne was equally good . Spacey and Fishburne owned the movie in their scenes . Kate Bosworth and Jim Sturgess were also in the movie , but were overshadowed by Spacey & & & possible minor spoilerSpacey and Fishburne are hardly really in the movie and i don't think he and i don't think they had any scenes together . i was mildly entertained , and never bored , but nothing beyond that . for me , 21 is a
472676	11423174	63350	6.0	better than the 1990 version	i finally had a chance to see this movie . it is hailed by many as a classic . while i can kind of see how that might be the case , i feel a bit letdown . when this movie came out , it was brutally shocking and innovative , but not so much today . it isn't a poorly made movie . in fact it is quite well made . the fact that it was filmed in black and white did add to the dark atmosphere and creepiness . the music worked well with the film , for the most . however at times it seemed to over power the film . the acting is pretty good . Duane Jones plays the character of Ben , the no nonsense , take charge character in the film . his portrayal is very effective and authentic . the movie also had a documentary fell to it , which elevated it . there are some weak points in the film . one is that the " Zombies " move so slow , and by slow i mean molasses uphill in January " slow " . the other is the apparent cause of the zombie-ism . it just seemed too far-fetched . despite all this , the film does move well and is worth watching , which is more than i can say for the horrible 1990 version . i'd have to say a strong for this one
472572	11423174	166943	6.0	similar to Mr . Holland's Opus , but not as good	this movie based on a true story Stars Meryl Streep as a music teacher who changes the lives of inner city students . it's in the same vein as Mr . Holland's Opus , but nowhere nears as good , in my mind . it lacks the depth and heart of that movie . it's also slow at times and those sweeping orchestral scores get to be too much after awhile . even though Streep is the headliner , i actually really liked Angela Basset . i though she was terrific . Aidan Quinn is also very good , in a small role . though i was disappointed in the movie , it still has it moments of inspiration , and is worth watching . it's just no masterpiece . it's directed by Wes Craven ( The Nightmare on Elm Street series ) . for me , Music of the Heart is a
473023	11423174	301339	6.0	pretty safe , harmless family fare	i think this is a fairly entertaining family movie . it's harmless fluff , really , and it can be a bit slow . but the characters are all likable , and it's suitable for kids of any age , except maybe really young kids . it might be a bit intense for them . and kids over 12 might find it boring . adults might not find it that entertaining . of course , it depends on your tastes . still , it's nice to watch a movie without any sex or violence once in awhile . with all the negative things kids are exposed to nowadays , this movie would probably be a welcome change of pace . just don't expect a lot of realism . and the story is pretty thin . but for safe , harmless viewing , you can't go really go too wrong with this movie . for me , Gentle Ben ( 2002 ) is a
473746	11423174	204313	6.0	ten times better than the alternate version ( " Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist " )	this is a hard movie to rate . When compared to : " Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist " , this is masterpiece . Let's start with the positive points . very stylish , visually more appealing . a fair bit of substance . much more suspenseful than " Dominion " . this piece was much more character driven . Merrin's , motives were more clearly defined and more plausible . there was much more action than " Dominion " . the characters were more believable and thus more sympathetic . The movie was also very atmospheric with an undercurrent of unease permeating it . the music was used to good effect , as well . this movie was not without its flaws , however . in fact it shares one failing with " Dominion " . that is , the poor cgi , in this case hyenas , and a sandstorm that did not look real . the Church looked like a miniature when shown in a long shot of the sand rolling over it . the demon at times looked cgi , not real in its movements , kind of jerky . the demon looked like a carbon copy of the one in the Original " The Exorcist " . whether this is intentional or not , I'm not sure . one scene in particular was very derivative of again the original , with the demon spouting blasphemous obscenities at the priest . in a way this kind of makes sense especially if this is the same demon that Merrrin is to meet years later . i did like the last scene showing Father Merrin walking away , wearing i believe the same garb he would wear years later , when battling the demon ( or a different demon ) again , a powerful scene . the only complaint i have within this scene is that it is clear the buildings are not actually there . either Stellann Skargard ( Merrin ) is walking in front of a green screen or the buildings have been painted in . this diminishes the impact the scene could have had . i also have to mention that the movie very gory at times , sometimes revolting in its use of maggots and such . however , i would have to say " Exorcist : The Beginning is watchable , even compelling at times . i sensed something could happen at any time and did not want to leave my seat until the movie concluded . a strong
473038	11423174	876154	6.0	entertaining made for TV movie	To have and to Hold has shades of Fatal Attraction , but is nowhere near as intense or complex . Justine Bateman Plays Meg , a woman who believes her husband , Tom ( Sebastian Spence ) is having an affair . he was , but has since broken it off . of course , the woman he was seeing cannot let it go , and keeps phoning or showing up where he is . this woman is not nearly as psycho as the psycho in Fatal Attraction . However her actions do lead to violence and murder . there are a few plot twists in this movie , but nothing that can't be figured out . Bateman and Spence are fine in the lead roles . this movie is a bit more morbid and depressing at times than many TV movies , but it still passes the time , and is not boring . To Have and to Hold gets
473368	11423174	33021	6.0	Santa Fe Trail	this isn't really a western , although it does take place during the same era which encompasses the genre . it's more of an action / adventure , with some drama and romance thrown . it takes place 6 or 7 years before the civil war , and details the events leading up to it , or at least this movie's version of it . it stars Errol Flynn , Ronald Reagan , Olivia de Havilland , and Van Heflin . here we meet George Custer , future general , but right now , newly graduated West Point military Academy Cadet . i thought his was quite a good movie . it flows very well , the acting is good , especially from Raymond Massey , who plays John Brown , a man who has fought against slavery , but has become an ego maniacal madman in the process . Massey's performance is brilliant . the movie does feel a bit long , but otherwise i liked it . for me , Santa Fe trail is a
472585	11423174	289879	6.0	decent time travel movie	this movie has a good premise . going back in time to change your present or future and the ramifications this could have . it's not an original premise , but it's 1 that hasn't been done to death yet . at least i don't think so . the movie has some good dramatic moments and some suspense , but i didn't really find it all that compelling . it is quite disturbing in some scenes . i think this is Ashton Kutcher " s first big starring dramatic role , and i didn't quite buy him in the role . he has improved since then , though , most notably in " The Guardian " also starring Kevin Costner . in the " The Butterfly Effect " he seems a bit over his head . Amy Smart is also in this movie , and is good as always . my vote for " The Butterfly Effect " :
473320	11423174	399146	6.0	small town hero becomes focus of mysterious stranger	A History of Violence is a rare foray into mainstream film for director David Cronenberg . it is a solid effort , with good performances all around . this is also change of pace from the roles Viggo Mortensen usually plays . story concerns small town family Tom Stall ( Mortensen ) who becomes local hero after killing 2 armed robbers at his diner . After all the publicity Tom is visited at his diner by a mysterious a stranger ( Ed Harris ) who insists that Tom is in fact someone else and that they know each other . Tom of course denies this . The stranger continues two follow both Tom and his wife ( Maria Bello ) and questions arise as to who Tom really is . The movie is not boring by any means , but it is not overly compelling either . it gives us just enough information to hold our interest . I liked the scenes of violence . they were very vivid and authentic . There is no character development in this movie , out of necessity to the plot line , so this does not hinder the movie . Maria Bello is effective as the wife , but her role is so small and she is given very little to do . had she been given more to do this movie may have been better . i did not like the ending at all . i thought they could have explained e few things . if it weren't for these two issues , i would have given it a higher rating . as it is this movie gets a
472700	11423174	963794	6.0	a decent enough 91 minute time killer	this was not what i would term a great movie , but it isn't that bad either . it's a psychological thriller / horror . it's not really very fast paced , but it does build some suspense and atmosphere . i liked that aspect of it . but there are some scenes later on in the film ( probably at least halfway through ) that are absolutely disgusting . at least i thought so . for me , theses scenes showed more than was necessary . if you're a gore hound , these scenes won't likely bother you . if you have a weak stomach , you'll have to turn away when these scenes appear . i don't have a weak stomach , but i was unprepared for how graphic the movie became . aside from the that , i think the movie is fairly original . it does borrow a concept from a horror / Sci-Fi movie of quite a long time ago , but as far as i know this particular scenario hadn't been done by any film in recent history , although i could be wrong . also , i think it could be similar to 2006's Turistas , though i haven't seen that movie yet . i think i will though to see if there are any similarities . for me , this was an OK 91 minute diversion , which i don't regret . i give The Ruins a
473770	11423174	146838	6.0	pretty good , but a bit slow and long	this movie has a lot of good things going for it . one of them is the great ensemble cast . this includes Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz as the marquee names . however , i don't think they were the stars of the show . that distinction is shared with the supporting cast . there are some big names here . Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quaid are both terrific . LL Cool J also puts in a strong performance . James Woods give his usual good performance . in smaller roles , but no less effective , are Matthew Modine , Aaron Eckhart and John C . McGinley . Lauren Holley , though , puts in a very strong performance and really impressed me . the movie also has a high degree of realism during the scenes on the football field . you can hear every bone crunching hit wit astounding clarity . and there is a high energy atmosphere for the most part . there are some down sides to the movie , though . one of these is the running time , at over two and a half hours . i felt they could have shaved off maybe twenty minutes . also i felt that the movie doesn't always follow through with the momentum it builds . it gets a bit tedious at times . finally , the scenes with Cameron Diaz and Al Pacino together . i felt Pacino tended to overact a bit , and Diaz seemed a bit out of her depth . Diaz was pretty good otherwise . anyway , for me , Any Given Sunday is a
473370	11423174	62645	6.0	Lee Van Cleef , Lionel Stander , Antonio Sabato , BUd Spencer , Gordon Mitchell .	this spaghetti western is not too bad . i though the story was interesting , and there are some good performances . Lee Van Cleef is the main star , and is quite good here . but he is overshadowed by a few others . Antonio Sabato ( father of pseudo-actor Atonio Sabato Jr . ) for one puts in a terrific performance , as does Lionel Stander ( 80'S TV show Hart to Hart . i also liked Bud Spencer ( who acted in numerous spaghetti Westerns ) though i wish his role had been bigger . but the real standout , in my mind , is Gordon Mitchell , for his " ice water in his veins ' portrayal of Burton . the big negative for me though is the length of the film . i feel it is at least 30 minutes too long , and it moves fairly slow at times . but the performances overcome that weakness . for me , Beyond The Law ( 1968 ) is a
473383	11423174	120008	6.0	throws believability way out the window	wow . if you like relentless fast and furious action and stunts that completely throw any semblance of believability out the window , this is your movie . if you're really good at suspending your disbelief , you ' ll probably like this movie . personally , think there's only so much the human mind can accept , and for me , this movie far exceeds that limit . as in another movie i reviewed , it would have been better if the characters were all dressed in matching red capes and blue underwear . i also think more bullets were used in this movie than were actually even made . again , that's not to say that this is a bad movie . it's just that it could have been so much better . after awhile , when moviegoers are bombarded by wall to wall action and stunts that defy reality , they become desensitized and are no longer impressed with such things . people are smarter than filmmakers and studios think they are . anyway , i give " The replacement Killers " a
472938	11423174	98084	6.0	very creepy " people come back from the dead " tale	the movie Pet Semetary is a pleasant surprise . it is much better than i had hoped for . after all , Stepthen King adaptations seem to be hit and miss . the story is quite a creepy concept , though it is not so much about the pet semetary , but an ancient MicMac burial ground which is said to bring back from the dead those who are buried there . problem is , they don't come back quite the same . of course you just know that someone will bury a loved one there , which is when things start to get creepier . Fred Gwynne is very well cast as the slightly odd ( elderly ) neighbor of the Creed family , who have just moved in next door . the one slight problem i found was that Denise Crosby was almost a bit of a weak link in this story . She seemed out of her depth . otherwise , a very entertaining , creepy tale , to say the least . certainly worth watching . out of 10
472651	11423174	360717	6.0	a good movie that had the potential for greatness	i was very disappointed in king kong . i thought it would be better than it was it . takes to long to get to the action , focusing much too long on the romance between two of the main characters . there were some exciting moments to be sure , but there was also a lot of repetition . sometimes the action went much longer than it should have . this film had some humour injected into it , which the original did not have . however , the humor is misplaced in this film , and just doesn't work . it almost seems like a time filler and very contrived , and slows the movie down . there are also some whimsical moments in the film , which take away from kong's dignity and majesty , making him not quiet wimpy , but less of a force to be reckoned with . on the plus side , the ape is very realistic looking , including the hair and eyes , which are very hard to make natural using cgi . however , the ape's movements are sometimes herky jerky , showing cgi still has a few bugs to work out . that's not to say this is a bad film . it's not . it's just not as good as it could have been . It is too long , and could have benefited from some editing . and it could have been paced better . i have to give this film a rating
473093	11423174	98136	6.0	very campy ( but in a good way )	this is not what you would term a horror movie . it's basically a black comedy , and i found it pretty effective as such . it doesn't take itself seriously at all , which is why i think it works . it's outrageously over the top at times , and there are some very good lines in this movie . the acting is not what i would call great , but it works with the film . as long as you approach it being tongue in cheek , and enjoy the campiness you should have fun with it . if you take it seriously , you probably won't like it . i enjoyed this movie more than the two previous installments , but that's just me . my vote for Prom Night III : The Last Kiss is a
473580	11423174	481536	6.0	probably more offensive than the first one , and nowhere near as funny	this sequel to the first Harold and Kumar has some funny moments , but i didn't think it was anywhere near as funny as the first . the good news is that the laughs are full belly laughs , that will leave you crying . the bad news : there aren't very many of them . however , i did find that the story was better and more fleshed out . Rob Corddry is hysterical in his scenes . well most of them anyway . one thing i didn't care for is that there's a scenes which shifts the tone away fro the comedy . i found this inexplicable and also unnecessary . this movie is at least as offensive as the first one , probably more so . if the first one offended you , you'll want to avoid this one . for me , Harold and Kumar 2 is a
473217	11423174	360201	6.0	it almost worked for me ( but not quite )	i was kinda disappointed by this movie . it wasn't a horrible movie . i just thought they could have done more with it . it's sort of a romantic comedy , but really more of a tennis movie . the tennis scenes are one of the strong points of the movie . they looked real to me . i believed that the actors could be tennis players . the romance aspect was not bad . i thought the two leads ( Kirsten Dunst , Paulbettany ) had some chemistry . but i just felt there was something missing . i'm not sure what it was . all i can say is this movie didn't quite do it for me . it was certainly watchable and not boring , but not quite compelling either . having said that i give " Wimbledon " a
472590	11423174	362942	6.0	not the best movie i've ever seen , and not the worst	i didn't mind this movie . it's not the best movie i've ever seen , and it certainly isn't the worst . it's basically about post apocalyptic world after comet has destroyed much of the earth . most of the movie takes place after the comet has struck , so there are no big budget special effects for the disaster itself . i thought the filmmakers did a good job showing what the world might look like after much of it is decimated . there is more drama than anything in this movie , but i thought it was done well . i didn't get bored . i thought the acting was good enough , and there was a bit of action . i don't think the movie was original , but so what . most of the stuff churned out nowadays isn't . in my opinion , " Post Impact " is a .
472724	11423174	116130	6.0	much better than McHale's navy	i bought both this movie and McHale's Navy cheap at the same time . i thought McHale's navy was pretty much a disaster . it's supposed to be funny , but i didn't think so . Down Periscope is in a similar vein , but is actually fairly funny at times . it's not great , but i did laugh on occasion . Kelsey Grammar is the main star . Lauren Holly , Bruce Dern , William H . Macy , Harland Williams , and Rip Torn also star , among others . even Rob Schneider has a role , but he is actually funny here . of course , he isn't the main character so that helps . along with some laughs , there's also a bit of action and excitement . in the end the movie turns out pretty decent . my vote for Down Periscope is a
472638	11423174	109444	6.0	better than Patriot Games , but still pretty slow and boring	while i don't think this is a great movie , i do think it is better than the the last one , Jack Ryan film , Patriot Games . in Clear and Present Danger , Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan . this one has a bit more intrigue than Patriot Games , and i also like the story more . it is more developed . to me , this one has a bigger scope . there is bit more urgency as well . having said that , i still think this movie is boring and slow , more often than not . Like Patriot Games , it's certainly not awful , but again i think maybe something got lost in the translation from Tom Clancy's novel . it's also almost 2 and a half hours long , and i think they could have trimmed some of it . still , it has it's good moments . for me , Clear and Present Danger is a
473534	11423174	252028	6.0	rich man rents a family to spend Christmas with	i know it's not Christmas season , but i thought i'd watch this movie anyway . i didn't really have any expectations going in , so imagine my surprise when this turns out to be a watchable movie . it's not really very funny , but it has some amusing moments and it's not boring . i guess this was supposed to be a Ben Affleck vehicle , but i thought James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara had the more interesting characters and added more to the movie than Affleck did . Affleck does okay here , but he really has less to do than Gandolfini and O'Hara . Christina Applegate has a small role in the movie . this is a movie that satisfies you for 90 minutes , and then is quickly forgotten soon after . for me , " Surviving Christmas " is watchable and entertaining . as a result , i'll give it a
472570	11423174	78790	6.0	better than the first movie	in my mind this sequel is better than the first movie . i thought it was funnier , and much better paced . it's shorter , but there's more packed into it . the story is better . Tom Conway and Don Knotts reprise their roles from the first one . unfortunately Bill Bixby does not return . on the plus side , there is more comic mayhem in this one and more action in general . once again , the movie is family friendly . again , if you have nothing else to do on a lazy Sunday , you could do worse than this movie . like the first one , it's no masterpiece , and it's not supposed to be one . it is however an improvement . for me , The Apple Dumpling Gang is a
473239	11423174	424345	6.0	had to knock off a point for this one ( read on to find out why )	to me , this sequel is way better than the original . it's much funnier , though it is still as raunchy , maybe more so . it could be offensive to some . spoiler aheadthere's even a scene of bestiality , as much as they could show about 70 minutes in , lasting about 7 minutesend of spoiler . that was a bit too disturbing for me , and i don't think there was really any call for it . but besides that unfortunate aspect , the movie is pretty good . there's actually a real story here this time , and i really cared about the characters . i thought the ending was good too . not your conventional ending . then again , this isn't a conventional movie . normally , this movie would be a 7 , but i have to knock a point off for the bestiality scone . therefore , Clerks II is a
472763	11423174	37536	6.0	sequel to Going my Way	this is the sequel and more famous cousin to Going my Way . Bing Crosby reprises his role of Father O'Malley . Ingrid Bergman co-stars . this movie is much deeper than it's predecessor , and has a much better , stronger story . Crosby and Bergman are both brilliant here . the story has some very touching moments . i welled up a few times . there are strong themes of hope and faith and miracles here , and the human spirit . wheres there are a quite a few lighter , comedic moments in Going my Way , there aren't that many here . it's much more serious in tone . i don't know if Bergman and / or Crosby won academy awards for their portrayals , but they give award worthy performance . the movie does feel a bit long and there are some slow moments , but overall , i liked it . i give The Bells of St . Mary's a
472758	11423174	1287845	6.0	educational and fun for the kids , entertaining enough for the adults	this is a short animated film dealing of course , with the furious five , from original Kung Fu Panda movie . i thought it was OK . it has some great lessons for kids , and it's kinda cute , especially the bunnies . minor spoilerit's really a bunch of mini stories about the past of each of the furious five , in which each one learned a very important virtue . each member gets around five or six minutes each . end of spoiler . anyway , this little short is fun and easy to watch for the kids , and entertaining enough for the grownups . they got quite a bit of info into the short running time , and none of the characters gets short changed in terms of screen time and story . for me , Kung Fu Panda : Secrets of the Furious Five is a
472855	11423174	80761	6.0	great musical score	i have no doubt that if i had seen this when it first came out in 1980 , it would have scared the crap out of me . in the present day though , i didn't find it scary , mainly because i have seen so many horror / slasher movies since then . this movie is hardly graphic or shocking at all compare to today's feature film , and even some TV shows , for that matter . however , i will say really enjoyed the musical score by Henry Manfredini , who must have been influenced strongly by Bernard Herman , who scored Psycho . i believe Kevin bacon makes his big screen debut here . the acting for this type of movie is fine , although i have to single out Betsy Palmer for really standing out . this movie spawned , i believe , 10 sequels , all differing in quality . my vote for Friday the 13th is a
473796	11423174	60862	6.0	not bad , though i found it slow at times	this western tells the story of four men , each a specialist in a different field , hired to rescue a woman kidnapped by a Mexican revolutionary . of course it's not quite as straightforward as that , and things don't quite go the way they should . it stars Lee Marvin , Burt Lancaster , Ralph Bellamy and Jack Palance , among others . i didn't mind the movie , but i thought it would be a bit better than it was . for me , there just wasn't a lot of action , but there was a lot of talking . it sort of reminded me a bit of the Dirty Dozen , though i liked that movie better . still , this movie is entertaining enough , if not fast paced . i think you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time . for me , it rates a
473418	11423174	80738	6.0	above average crime drama	int his police drama , Frank Sinatra plays a police detective just weeks from retirement , trying to solve a string of murders and stop the murder from killing again . there's another little subplot thrown in that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie , but is merely added to make the film more interesting dramatically , at least , i think that's the reason . Sinatra is very good here , and really the only central character . the rest of the cast are in supporting roles or extended cameos . anyway , the film does work . it's very atmospheric , and the tone is one of almost melancholy , but it works here . my vote for The First deadly Sin is a
472940	11423174	144814	6.0	almost comparable to the original	is The Rage : Carrie 2 a worth successor to the original Carrie ? hard to say . it has its moments , or rather " moment " . the problem is , that moment does not occur until the end of the movie . much of the movie comes off looking like your typical teen movie . by that i mean it has all the stereotypical caricatures you expect in a teen movie . which is great , unless you are expecting something more . the acting is okay , given the dialogue . however , there is no suspense in this film and the music does not compare to the original . the plot follows the original Carrie somewhat , although there is less of a relationship between the awkward outcast and her mother , in fact almost none . there is however , one little twist to the story , which i liked . the outcast this time is named Rachel . however unlike Carrie , Rachel is not some much taunted by her classmates as she is shunned , as if she doesn't exist . it is not until later in the film , through a series of events , which i won't go into here , that Rachel becomes the target of cruel abuse and ridicule . what Rachel goes through is pretty mean , but is it comparable what Carrie endured ? the answer is no . in the original it is strongly implied that Carrie was a victim through much of her life . Rachel , on the other hand is largely simply ignored for much of her life . for a brief moment in time , Rachel becomes a victim of a cruel prank . Rachel of course also has the ability to move objects with her mind . she exacts revenge on her tormentors in a spectacular fashion . there are some gruesome scenes here , lowering this film to a slasher flick towards the end . however , the ending of this movie is not anti climatic , as was the original . instead it almost suffers from overkill . but is it as good as or comparable to the original ? almost . out of 10
472734	11423174	109370	6.0	American president starts cold war with Canada to boost popularity ratings	this movie started out good . the premise is funny and original . there are some very funny scenes . but about halfway through it loses steam . maybe it's because the novelty wore off and the jokes were no longer funny . Michael Moore directed this film and has a good cast to work with , including Alan Alda , Kevin Pollak , Rhea Perlman , Rip Torn and the late , great John Candy . the movie should have worked , and it does for awhile , like i said . i lost interest about halfway through , and by the time it was over , i was paying pretty much no attention to it . as a result , and based on the original premise and funny 1st half , the most i can give " Canadian Bacon " is .
473461	11423174	96073	6.0	another " end of the world " movie , but nothing new or compelling .	ho-hum . another one of those " all signs point to the end of the world movies " . as these types of movie go , this film is much too lacking in substance to be compelling viewing . think " the Omen " ( the original ) lite . very lite . there are a few variations on the theme , true , but the movie fails to make a lasting impression ( or any impression ) the actors put in good performances , and bear no responsibility for the film's failure . credit that to the lacklustre script which is simply has no depth . as well as the direction , which , ironically has no direction . the original The Omen , set the Standard for this genre and has yet to be nor will likely ever be surpassed . as for the Seventh Sign , it is a good diversion , but will quickly be forgotten after viewing . a good rule of thumb about this type of movie is that it should stick with and make you question things . this movie does neither .
472670	11423174	366627	6.0	time travel via strait jacket ?	The jacket is essentially about a gulf war vet who has amnesia . he is brought to an institution , where his treatment consists of him being put in a strait jacket and locked in a morgue drawer as part of some bizarre experiment by the doctor . the catch is , that while bound in the strait jacket , he travel through time . i'll leave it at that plot wise . i liked this movie for the most part , although it is depressing at times . the concept is unique , not so much the time travel aspect , but the method of travel . the movie is very dialogue focused , so there is not a lot of action . if you like lots of action , this might not be you thing . Adrian Brody plays jack Stark , the gulf war vet , Kiera Knightly ( naked ) plays the love interest . Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristfferson also star in the movie . the acting is as good as most films . the movie is like i said , depressing at times , so i found it hard to watch , but it is thought provoking . overall , this is probably a better than average movie .
472844	11423174	160009	6.0	fairly intelligent political thriller	this political thriller isn't too bad . it's not really fast paced paced , and there is some predictability to it . but it should have enough twists and turns to keep you guessing . it's also a fairly intelligent movie . it's also compelling enough to maintain interest . at least i thought so . i also found it more stylish than many movies of the genre . Wesley Snipes is the main star , but there are some other well known actors here . these include Anne Archer , Maury Chakin , Donald Sutherland , Michael Bien , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and James Hong . for this type of movie , this one is not as over the top with ridiculous action scenes . though it does have a few scenes with strain believability a bit . for me , The Art of War is a
472852	11423174	87298	6.0	great ending ( )	this fourth entry in the series is actually not too bad . i liked it a bit better than the other 3 , mainly because of the ending , which was pretty climactic , unlike many movies . plus , it was better paced . this one features a 12 year old Corey Feldman , but i still liked it . it pretty much follows the familiar formula of the last 3 . minor spoilerit's called the Final Chapter , but if you've followed the series at , you know it isn't . end of spoilerit probably was going to be , but then the filmmakers realized they had a cash cow on their hands , and couldn't pass up the opportunity to keep churning them out . whether that's good or bad is a matter of opinion . in any case , my vote for Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter is a
472858	11423174	286716	6.0	ang lee's thoughtful , touching , dramatic take on the hulk	the first time i watched ang lee's hulk , i didn't like it that much . i found it boring and it took way to long to get to the action scenes . then , a few year later , i decide to give it another chance . boy , i'm glad i did . this time around , i enjoyed the movie . going into the movie the first time , the only thing i was expecting was action . this time i had a much more open mind . as i watched the dramatic scenes , i realized how skillful ang lee is at directing people and getting strong emotional performances out of them . i got very involved in the interaction of the characters and i was much more interested in their fates . by focusing on character development in the beginning of the film , we are much more sympathetic to the characters later on in the film . the action scenes are exciting to watch , but at times do not quite look realistic . a lot of the times hulk's action look cartoons and his movements are very jerky at times . also , the detail is not quite real , in particular the eyes , which did not look natural . granted this was 3 years ago and the technology had not been perfected . it may have looked better today . however , there were more reasons to like this movie than not . there is certainly chemistry between the two main characters bruce banner and betty ross , ex girlfriend but still friend to bruce . there are also some very convincing and touching moments between betty and hulk . sam elliot plays betty's father an army general who believes hulk could be an invaluable military weapon , but is also sympathetic to his daughters ' feelings and wishes . and josh lucas plays talbot a man who thinks only of himself and his career and seeks to exploit hulk . lucas was very convincing as a real a # $ ! hole . summing up , this was a fairly well-made movie , with well developed characters and good performances . a little lacking in the realism dept ( i . e . cgi effects ) . otherwise no major problems out of 10
473686	11423174	488120	6.0	check out Primal Fear by the same director	i think this was billed as a legal thriller . trouble is , it's not really thrilling . it sort of plods along to the inevitable end . plus , in my opinion , Anthony Hopkins ( the bad guy ) , appears to be doing a lighter variation of Hannibal Lector . i also felt Ryan Gosling , as the main good guy , was a bit too young for the character he portrayed . but there are some bright spots in the movie . one of them is David Strathairn , who i feel is a very underrated actor and not utilized enough . and i thought the ending was a refreshing change from most movies of the genre . anyway , the movie wasn't boring enough to quit watching , but before the end credits had rolled , i had only become half interested . Gregory Hoblit directed this movie , and he also directed Primal Fear , which in my mind is a much superior thriller . you might want to check it out . as for Fracture , i give it a
472634	11423174	299854	6.0	a revenge drama more than anything ,	and i do mean drama . this is not an action packed movie . the emphasis is definitely on the drama . it's all about the trouble a man goes to to get revenge on a guy who killed his wife . it takes quite awhile to get there , and when it does , it's almost not worth it , at least in my opinion . i don't mind if a movie takes awhile to get to the payoff , except in this movie , there isn't really a payoff . i sorta wondered to myself if it was worth all the trouble the guy went through . but the movie is at least watchable . plus , there is a bit of character development and there's some pretty good acting . plus , it's not as if the movie is drop dead boring or anything . i just expected more . if you're an action junkie , you should look elsewhere for your fix . you won't find it here . when all is said and done , i think The Escapist is worth a .
473783	11423174	100507	6.0	the weakest of the series ( but still watchable )	i haven't seen the new Rocky movie , Rocky Balboa , so i can't comment on that . but of the first 5 movies , this is the weakest . they should have stopped at 4 . the movie is watchable , it's just not up to par with its prequels . it is definitely smaller scale all around . this is obviously deliberate and it certainly sets a different tone for the film . there are some interesting things in this movie . one is who Rocky fights and why . the other is how and where . mild spoiler ahead . there is also a sub-plot involving Rocky's son . besides these things , however , it just fails to impress . there really wasn't any need for a 5th movie in the Rocky saga , but they made 1 anyway . so , is this movie worth watching ? of course . it is entertaining . just don't expect anything mind blowing .
473844	11423174	97815	6.0	entertaining and amusing , though not insanely funny baseball movie	i thought this was a pretty good movie . it wasn't insanely funny or anything , but it had some amusing moments and was certainly entertaining . what i liked about this movie is is the fact that , although it's an underdog story , it is not preachy and schmaltzy . there's very little rah , rah , rah , everyone's a winner clap trap . it just goes to show that a movie can tell an under dog story , without hitting you over the head with it , and making you nauseous . i also liked the unique mix of characters in the movie , with all their quirks . they are really an oddball assortment . i'm not really a baseball fan , but i liked the movie just as a movie , and not so much as a baseball movie . for me , Major League " is a
473886	11423174	452637	6.0	well , that was weird	Lady in the Water is the latest movie from M . Night Shyamalan , and it is a weird one . i could make little sense of it , and there seemed to be some gaping plot holes . to me , it seemed to be a philosophy lesson at times , which is good if you want a philosophy lesson , but i didn't . add to that , to me there was a lot of overacting going on . the movie just didn't make a lot of sense . Shyamalan says this is a fairy tale ( which he apparently created ) he used to tell his children went hey were young . for a young child , this would probably be entertaining , and some adults might enjoy it . normally i watch a movie to be entertained , and don't worry about plot holes or gaps in logic . but for me , there were just too many to overlook . Not a horrible movie , by any means but not as good as it could have been .
472569	11423174	64780	6.0	may big names stars of Westerns ( and other genres ) past	this is a pretty decent western with some good comic moments . it features many famous names of the genre , such as Walter Brennan , Jack Elam , Edgar Buchanan , Gypsy Lee Rose , Pat O'Brien and Ricky Nelson . all had previously been in earlier westerns and here were in the twilight of their careers . i won't give away the plot , but the title certainly fits the movie and the characters . the actors themselves aren't over the hill , even though their characters may be . in fact , they all put in good performances , though Jack Elam was the best of the bunch , in my mind . one thing about the movie i should mention is that it actually felt more like a TV episode than a movie . the version i watched was only 70 minutes . still , it is an entertaining diversion . for me , The Over the Hill Gang is a
473272	11423174	307479	6.0	poor ending lowers the rating on this movie	part philosophy , alternate reality , God . human existence . this movie seems to ask a lot of questions . it is compelling for most of it's running time , although it i found it quite deep , with very little action . I also thought George Clooney took awhile to grow into his character . at 1st , i didn't find him convincing in his role , but somehow that changed throughout the course of the movie . the problem i found with this movie is that it for much of the time it is a deep , thought provoking movie . I don't believe in some of the views put forth , but nevertheless , the movie was engaging . however it drew me in , and then the ending was a cop out , too neatly tied up , and not at all realistic . i don't mind watching a ' pure , shut of your brain ' action movie , because i no what i am getting . so if a movie stars out compelling and engaging i expect it to end appropriately . in my view , this movie does not do so . i would have given it , but because of the ending i am deducting 2 stars . as a result , my vote for " Solaris " is / 10
473897	11423174	87262	6.0	decent science fiction thriller	i thought this was an entertaining movie . it wasn't spectacular , by any means , but i've seen way worse . Drew Barrymore shows some acting ability at a young age . i think she was around 8 when this was made . the rest of the acting was decent enough for the most part . i did think that George C . Scott seemed out of place , though . the story itself was interesting and there were some moments of suspense . whether it was as good as Stephen King's novel , i can't say , since i haven't read the novel . the effects were pretty good for that time . the movie is one hour and 55 minutes and it could have been shorter by about 20 minutes or so , in my opinion . but if nothing else , it was a decent diversion . for me , Fire Starter is a
472776	11423174	107084	6.0	decent little mystery , but not spectacular	i though this was a decent little movie . it's about a writer who is sent to Mexico for inspiration , to wrote the next big story , which will hopefully be made into a movie . while in Mexico , he wakes up one morning to find one of his kidneys missing . he then discovers they want his second kidney . i didn't find this movie overly exciting , but it did keep my interest . some of the scenes stretch into implausibility and are not realistic . it's also pretty predictable for the most part , if you're paying attention . the other thing is , the movie is pretty low key . it's mot what i would call action packed or exciting . still , it was an enjoyable diversion and I've sen worse . for me , The Harvest is a
473124	11423174	14532	6.0	not bad for a silent movie made in 1923	this is the first film version of The Ten Commandments . it is directed by Cecil B . Demille , who also directed the 1956 version . this version is very lean , going through the events of that time , very quickly . in 50 minutes , in fact . i'm guessing they just kept the essentials of the story , without anything extra . the special effects are quite something for that day . the film must have been a grand undertaking . the remaining 80 minutes or so is a morality play set in more modern times ( around 1923 , i'm guessing ) concerning how the Ten Commandments relate to modern life , and what happens if we don't obey them . for me , this second half is just way too heavy handed and preachy . the message is a good one , but it feels like you're being hit over the head with sledgehammer . some of the acting may seem a bit exaggerated , but they had to act that way , since they didn't have sound . there is an orchestral accompaniment , that plays through out the film . the only problem is , i found the music too repetitive . it got annoying after awhile . still , considering that this movie was mad in 1923 , it's not too bad . my vote for The Ten Commandments ( 1923 ) is a
472851	11423174	89173	6.0	part 5 ( )	this fifth entry in the series has an interesting twist that is hinted subtly ( or maybe not subtly ) a few times throughout the movie . i liked the ending to part 4 : The Final Chapter , but i liked this ending even more . otherwise , there's not much straying from the familiar formula mined in the last 4 . masked psycho slaughters several people for no apparent reason . some of the characters in this one are just plain unlikable , or stupid . once again the acting is nothing special , but then again , that's to be expected when your characters are merely plot devices , and nothing more . for me , this movie wasn't as good as the fourth . my vote for Friday the 13th-Part 5 : A new Beginning is a
473695	11423174	95956	6.0	too much philosophizing and preaching for the first 60 minutes	i was disappointed in this installment of the Rambo series . i found it slow going for the first hour , plus it was too philosophical and preachy for my tastes . however , the last 40 minutes are pretty much wall to wall action . realism gets thrown out the window , though . i mean how much can one guy do , especially given the amount of pain inflicted on him , and the overwhelming odds against him . the only thing missing from this movie was Rambo's red cape . still , it'll definitely get your adrenaline pumping , if you can get through the first hour . but even the action doesn't raise it to the standard of the previous two movies . for me , Rambo III is a
473355	11423174	463953	6.0	" The Cutting Edge " lite	i just watched this movie last night . i had fairly high hopes , although i knew it wouldn't outdo the original . this one is really a rehash of the original , but with different characters . This time around , it's Jackie Dorsie ( son of Kate Mosely , now Mosely-Dorsey and Doug Dorsey , from the original ) . Moira Kelly and D . B Sweeney do not return as " older " Kate and Doug , but Stepfanie Kramer and Scott Thompson Baker both do okay in the roles , and Baker actually looks quite a bit like the older version of Doug might be , although they have relatively little screen time . that is reserved for the character of Jackie ( Christy Carlson Romano ) , also surprise , surprise a champion figure skater , with her own diva attitude . Her eventually training partner is extreme in line skater Alex Harrison ( Ross Thomas ) naturally these 2 have little in common and can't stand each other , but that doesn't come across as strongly as it should . there is less intensity between them , and the chemistry doesn't always seem quite there . you could call this " Cuttin Edge " lite . they could have made the animosity between the 2 stronger and more pronounced . also , some of the lines they had seemed contrived . the writing could have been stronger . the actors themselves aren't bad , but the script makes it harder for them to seem genuine . even many scenes which don't include the 2 leads together come across as clichéd . there are also times when he movie drags . this is a direct to video movie , and it is almost too family friendly for this type of material . it has a Disney feel to it . there is nothing wrong with a Disney movie per se , but this movie lacked the edge it should have had . the music is not too bad , but nothing really memorable or catchy . i won't say this is a bad movie , because I've seen a lot of bad movies , and this movie is nowhere near as bad as any of them . it just could have been better , given the potential . Christy Carlson Romano has made a career ( thus far , anyway ) out of mostly straight to video family movies , and of course the TV series Even Stevens ( which i really like ) and other TV show appearances . i think she can break out of this mold and graduate to more adult fare , given the right material , if she wanted . she certainly has the potential . anyway , back to the film , i'd have to give it
472601	11423174	98382	6.0	not as bad as people say	i don't get it . people say this is the worst Star Trek movie of them all . i'm not sure i agree . i kinda liked it . i know it's not action packed to say the least , and the plot may be unusual , but so what . i found this movie to have a fair amount of humour in it , not as much as the fourth installment , but some . the whole movie is really one 105 minute philosophy lesson , but that didn't really bother me . personally , i thought the story was interesting . enough to maintain my interest for the full running time . i wasn't bored at all . the premise could be called absurd , but it's certainly no more absurd than a lot of other films that get churned out . i think it was better than The first Star Trek movie and as good as the second one ( The Wrath of Kahn ) . i realize i may be in the minority here , but that's life . for me , Star Trek 6 : The Final Frontier is a
473666	11423174	305396	6.0	basically an extension of the Crocodile Hunter series	this is basically just an extension of the Crocodile Hunter TV series . it has it's amusing moments , and is entertaining enough , but it's not much more than a fluff piece . the plot is pretty weak , and most of the characters have no depth or development . most of the movie seems like just a showcase for Irwin's antics . plus , after about the 70 minute mark , it seems to lose any steam that it did have . still Steve Irwin and his wife Terri ( playing themselves ) are both likable characters , and Steve's antics are amusing . even in the movie , it's not hard to see their passion for wildlife . the message about how we should love and respect the animals on the planet , since many of them were here before us , and we are encroaching on their habitat , is not at all heavy handed or preachy . for me , Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course is a
473011	11423174	57129	6.0	has some real chills , but could have been shorter	while i thought the haunting was a good movie , i didn't think it was great . it does have some genuine chills , and is very atmospheric . the music certainly elevates the suspense factor . i did like the odd mix of characters , two of which were downright creepy . i thought the movie was too long and protracted though . it was also too talky . the continual voice over of one of the characters was annoying after awhile , too . i did like the irony in the movie though , and the ending was good . the acting was also very good . but there were some very slow , awkward moments which really lowered my opinion of it . still , it was well made , and you could do a lot worse with 112 minutes . by the way , this movie was remade a few years ago . i think i liked the remake a bit better . anyway , my vote for The Haunting :
472641	11423174	212513	6.0	very deliberately paced , but ultimately worth it	i admit , this is a very deliberately paced movie . just when you decide to turn it off from boredom , the movie drops you a tantalizing clue or two . just enough to keep you watching . this movie is all about the drama and the acting . it is very low key and the acting is good . the movie is a psychological suspense mystery . just when you think you have it figured out , it turns out you don't . i found it hard to know for sure who was crazy and who was sane and what was real and what wasn't . if you can get through it , i think it's worth it in the end . the ending is satisfying , even if it leaves unresolved questions . obviously this movie is not for everyone . if you're an action junkie , you might not be able to sit through this . otherwise , give it a shot
473549	11423174	175142	6.0	a few very funny moments , but not enough ( )	i remember watching this movie when it first came out , and thinking it was a scream . but , after just watching it again today , i have a different opinion . sure , there are a few very funny parts , but for the most part , i just found the movie silly . it definitely is not for anyone easily offended , that's for sure . this certainly isn't the worst movie i've ever seen , and as a spoof , it's OK . it certainly does lampoon a few horror movie and even some non horror movie , with varying degrees of success . ironically it almost works better as a horror movie than a spoof , in my mind . it is certainly watchable and not boring . it just isn't as funny as i originally remembered it . for me , Scary movie is about a
473734	11423174	76630	6.0	similar to " deliverance " but i don't think it's quite as good	this is not a bad movie . it's sort of like " Deliverance " . 5 friends go on a backwoods trip together . they are each doctors or former doctors . anyway , as the film progresses , things start to happen to the group . small things at 1st , than things get serious . the group realizes they are being stalked and terrorized by an unseen enemy , and their lives are in danger . the movie has its share of suspense and excitement . but it also has its share of tedious moments . the ending in particularly drags on way too long for my tastes . on the whole , though , this is worth watching . it came out in 1977 , so some modern audiences might not like it or even relate to it . if you liked " Deliverance " give this 1 a chance . i don't think it's quite as good , but it's in a similar vein . i think Rituals is
473278	11423174	402901	6.0	standard action adventure movie	the " cave " cannot be classified as a horror movie , since it is not horrifying . it is standard fare action adventure that uses music to try to manufacture suspense , but does not deliver . one problem is that the creatures were revealed much too soon , thereby eliminating a possible avenue of suspense . and once the creatures are revealed , it is readily apparent that the filmmakers borrowed heavily from the " alien " saga , and also from " predator " . at times the creatures just didn't look quite realistic , and at times they looked hokey . for instance , when one of the creatures is swinging along the top of the cave like a monkey swinging on a vine . this scene was quite funny and easily ruined any tension there may have otherwise been . i will say that giving the creatures the ability of flight was a novel idea and effective . one scene i really liked was where tyler comes up behind a creature and slits its throat , decapitating it . this scene just seemed to give the movie a much needed shot of adrenaline , albeit for a brief few seconds . however , there are far too many areas where the film was not effective . i didn't care too much for most of the characters , but the one character i did care for was charlie , played by piper perabo . however she was killed off , which disappointed me . i felt she she should have been one of the survivors . the ending was okay , and left open the possibility ( probability ) of a sequel . in short , the cave had very little to offer in the way of originality , but does have lots of action and some nice cinematography , so isn't a complete loss . it ranks lower than the cavern , but is entertaining . worth renting
473631	11423174	349205	6.0	not bad at all , some very funny moments	this movie isn't too bad . there are a couple of very funny moments in the movie . i also liked the energy level of the film . it was very high . the movie is entertaining for the most part . the only things i didn't like , is that thought Steve Martin over exaggerated his expressions and action in some of the physical comedy . i also thought the " inspirational " theme music was a bit overpowering at times . but these are just small complaints . otherwise , it's a pretty good movie . i thought the kids all did a good job acting . really like Bonnie Hunt , who played the wife and mother . i thought she was a standout in the movie . i did think the ending was predictable , but i'm sure that's by design . with most movies of this genre , you usually know how things will end up . after the movie ended , i felt satisfied that i had got my money's worth , which is more than can be said for many movies . i give " Cheaper by the Dozen " a strong
472914	11423174	452766	6.0	it's not the worst B movie i've seen	this is one sick and twisted movie . there isn't a lot of gore , but what gore there is , is pretty extreme . i also thought there was some continuity problems . some of the scenes don't seem to have any context , so it is hard to follow . it's a B movie , for sure , but , despite its problems , i thought it was OK . i liked the music and the atmosphere , and the story was interesting , though not completely original . think Evil Dead and a bit of Child's Play . i didn't think the acting was too bad . i don't think it was great , but i have seen much worse . towards the end , there is a hysterical scene , which sorta reminded me of the Child's Play movies . for me Curse of the Maya , AKA Dawn of the Living Dead ( nothing to do with George A . Romero's " Dead " series ) is a
472817	11423174	133093	6.0	not sure what all the hype is about .	i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie . i mean , it borrows heavily from other sources , such as the bible and Star Wars , among others . the gist of the story is that the world people see around them is isn't real . it's actually a construct made by machines . Humanity is actually enslaved by the machines . but there is one man who can free humanity . that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo . Neo is portrayed by Keanu Reeves . also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne . but in my mind , it is Hugo weaving who steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith . i will admit the movie has some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes . but some of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would call practical . also , a lot of the movie is slow moving , and the characters don't behave in logical ways . still , the movie does have its good moments . there are some genuine moments of high tension . this is the first of three movie in The Matrix franchise . for me , the first movie in the series is a
472905	11423174	468988	6.0	Sequel to Category 6 : day of destruction	this movie is the sequel to Category 6 : Day of Destruction . like category 6 , this one deals with a series of catastrophic storm systems , many converging together at one time , creating a series of super storms around the globe . however , this time an unprecedented category 7 is imminent over Washington , D . C which will leave the city in ruins , killing thousands of people . the government and the disaster agencies must find a way to avert disaster . there is also another , non weather related element to deal with , which adds another dimension . will disaster be averted ? you will have to watch the movie to find out . there is obviously a ton of action , as in the original . the cgi is quite good for a made for TV movie . the acting however , did not seem as convincing this time around . There are a few strictly minor league ( b movie or lower quality ) actors / actresses in this movie . also , this movie is much more preachy than the first . at times , it is almost a sermon on pollution and global warming . that put me off a fair bit . the movie is much faster paced than Category 6 , so it does movie quicker . the big problem however , is , how do you make the movie more intense than the last one ? i don't think you can . the movie is certainly louder , but visually , it had been already been done In the original . and although the movie had some tense moments , i wouldn't call it thrilling , and it wasn't really a fun experience . overall , i'd have to give this movie
472731	11423174	295590	6.0	modern day pirate ends up searching for buried treasure	this is a movie about a modern day pirate ( or at least , that's what he calls himself . really though he is simply a charter boat captain for hire and thief . his job does get him into some hairy situations , meaning a fair amount of action . there is even some intrigue and some romance as weals a hunt for buried treasure . captain Jefferey Thorpe ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) has 2 sidekicks who travel everywhere with him . mostly there for comic relief i guess . this has all the ingredients to be a great movie , yet it isn't . this whole sub genre of film has been done many times before , so there is little new or original in this movie . However , there is 1 thing this movie has going for it : Gerit Kling , who plays the dual role of Helna / Marlena and also the love interest of Thorpe . ( Griffith ) Kling is truly a stunning woman and when you combine that with her German accent , it's enough to make most men melt . ( i did anyway ) Griffith makes a credible action hero , if only the movie had something new to offer . despite the problems withe film , i'd still give it a , mostly for the beautiful love interest .
473373	11423174	25939	6.0	mystery / western	this is a pretty good western . but it's not just a western . it's also a mystery . actually it's probably more of a mystery than a western . it's short clocking in at around 65 minutes , but it's a pretty good movie . it stars Randolph Scott , Anne Sheridan , Kathleen Burke , Florence Roberts , Howard Wilson , Charles ' Chic ' Sale , Mrs . Leslie carter , George F . Marion , among others . i thought it was well done . it had a nice atmosphere , and wasn't wholly predictable . the acting was good by all concerned , and the story was interesting , but similar to another western i remember seeing . though i can't recall weather this movie came out before that one or not . by similar story , i don't mean the general outline and formula that most westerns follow . i mean that some of the story details and specifics are similar . regardless , i liked it . for me , The Fighting Westerner is a
473081	11423174	92003	6.0	doesn't hold a candle to the John Ford / John Wayne original	this is ( a far as i can tell ) the third version of the classic movie first directed in 1939 by John Ford and starring John Wayne . i haven't seen the second film ( 1966 ) so i can't comment on that one . this 1986 version though , i can comment on . in my mind , it doesn't come near to the original , which is a classic , and one of the best movies i have seen . this version has in many of the starring roles , Country and western singers of the era , including Willie Nelson , Waylon Jennings , Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson . also in the cast are John Schneider ( TV's Dukes of Hazard ) , June Carter Cash , Jessi Colter ( wife of Waylon Jennings ) , and Mary Crosby ( TV's Dallas ) the movie was an entertaining diversion , but the acting was underwhelming . The only decent performance of the bunch came from Kristofferson . most of the dialogue wasn't that great , either , including a lot of one or two word conversations . and what was up with Mary Crosby and those lips , which looked like she'd had an allergic reaction to peanuts or shellfish , or something . either way , it looked stupid . the movie was also slow , with not much happening of any consequence , and almost zero character development . when it was over , i was indifferent to it . it's nothing memorable and will probably have faded from my mind in a day or so . still , if you have nothing better to do , it passes about 90 minutes or so . for me Stagecoach ( 1986 ) is a
472715	11423174	115714	6.0	no better or worse than the second installment ( entertaining enough )	at first , it looked like this movie was going down the crapper and quickly . somehow , though , it turns out not too bad . unlike , number two , which isn't really a sequel , this one is . the main character returns , and learns more lessons . i liked the training montages . to me , they were better than the ones in the second film . at times , i could swear it was Van Damme on screen . Daniel Bernhardt really looks like at times . the plot is quite ridiculous , but the action is better , i think . the fight scenes are better at times . the ending could have been a bit better , as the climax seemed to short . however , overall , this movie is no better or worse than the previous entry , and it's not a complete waste of time . in fact , it's quite entertaining . so i'll give it a
473043	11423174	402850	6.0	A whiter shade of pale ( very pale shade of " Fargo " )	i think the maker's of this movie thought they were making another " Fargo " . Frozen tundra town in the middle of winter . Guy tries unsuccessfully to pull off a scam . Basically , Paul Barnell ( Robin Williams ) is a travel agent one step away from bankruptcy . he can't pay his bills , his wife has a mental illness of some sort ( exactly what is never really revealed ) and he doesn't have the money to send her to people who can help her . He tries unsuccessfully to make a claim on the insurance policy left by his brother , who has been gone 5 years . However , without a body , he has no case . he happens to luck upon a frozen body in a dumpster ( and after some planning ) attempts to pass it off as his brother . things don't go exactly as planned , however . let's just say a couple of mob hit men figure into the mix , as well as a suspicious insurance agent . this movie should have have been pretty decent , yet it was just above average . it doesn't have the edge that " Fargo " has , the characters are not as compelling , and the atmosphere just isn't really there . also Robin Williams is not up to standard here . he is just weepy and annoying . this is Mark Mylod's feature film debut , though he has directed episodes of various TV shows . Collin Friesen wrote the script . he also wrote the script for " Plague City : Sars in Toronto " , as well as a 17 min short entitled " Farm Sluts " . and no it is not a porno , but more a modern day farce about one man's life and how it quickly unravels due to a misunderstanding . Anyway , with a more seasoned writer and director , " The Big White " could have been a memorable movie . instead it is a pale attempt at evoking comparisons to " Fargo " . however it falls short .
473752	11423174	58461	6.0	the first in the Man With No Name trilogy	it took me awhile to get around to watching this movie , which is considered a classic by a lot of people . it was a bit too sedate for my tastes , although it wasn't a horrible movie and it probably bears viewing at least twice . it's the first of three movies in the Man With no Name trilogy , directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood as the man with no name . he's also the quiet man with no name . the character doesn't say much unless he needs to . he's brooding and mysterious , and doesn't give too much away about himself . he's also calm and cool , at least on the outside , showing little or no outward emotion . Eastwood is the perfect actor to play this character . though he was in the series Rawhide , it was apparently this series that rocketed him to fame . although i thought there were some slow moment here and there , i didn't hate the film , and i can understand why it has the following and reputation it does . for me , Fistful of Dollars is a
472698	11423174	420294	6.0	gorier than ever	if you're a gore hound , you will love this movie . i think it it is much gorier than any previous entry in the franchise . in fact , i think this movie makes any of the Friday the 13th movies look like an episode of Mr . Rogers Neighbourhood . this one just about crosses my gore threshold . having said that , i don't feel this movie was as thrilling as the previous ones . id didn't really feel any adrenaline rush . in fact , i thought some parts were slow . i did , however like how they showed that the genesis of both Leatherface and the rest of the family . they didn't spend a lot of time on this aspect , but i think they pretty much covered everything they needed . i also really liked the music . i thought it set a great tone for the movie . whether it's a better movie than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2001 is a matter of personal taste . for me , Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning is a
472706	11423174	94701	6.0	decent enough , but not for the squeamish	Bad Dreams is about a girl named Cynthia ( Jeniffer Rubin ) who survives a mass suicide , but is in a coma for 13 years . when she awakes from the coma , she begins seeing the leader of the cult . it seems he is still waiting for her to join him on the other side , and he will do whatever it takes to get her to join him . Richard Lynch plays the cult leader . i won't tell you exactly what happens but what results is a lot of blood and guts . if you're squeamish , you might want to avoid this one . if you've seen a lot of horror movies , then there will probably be nothing new to you in the gore dept . by the way , Susan Ruttan ( L . A . ) plays one of the patients in the hospital . anyway , i thought the movie was decent enough . it wasn't fast paced or anything , but it wasn't really slow either . it was somewhere in between . if you're into horror and you want pass a couple hours , you could do worse , especially if you catch it on premium cable , like i did .
472743	11423174	104029	6.0	creative and inventive , but not quite what i expected	i'll try not to give too much away , plot wise with this movie . but it basically involves the possibility of eternal life , ( sort of ) and there are some biblical parallels as well . there's a lesson in here that contains the old cliché , " be careful what you wish for " you may get what you want ( or thought you wanted ) but nothing is for free , and there are sacrifices . the movie is low budget and i don't mean that as a criticism . in some scenes , the movie actually works better as a result . overall , though i didn't like the movie as much as i thought i would . i'd had heard of it before , and had high expectations . i guess i though it would be more profound than it was . it has its moments , to be sure . it's not boring by any means , but it just has less of an impact than i hoped . it's directed and written by Guillermo del Toro , who also directed Hell Boy , Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth . as for " Cronos " it certainly is unique with a different twist on an old genre . for me , Cronos is a
472690	11423174	415167	6.0	a real mixed bag	this is an odd movie , to say the least . it's billed as a horror movie , though there isn't really much horror . there is a bit of suspense and tension . and the disgust factor is pretty high here . this movie isn't for the faint of heart or weak of stomach . i guess you'd call it a black comedy and i like the setting , even though it isn't wholly original . i also like the mix of odd ball characters . the music was very appropriate for the movie , for the most part , although i thought it was too loud at times and overpowered the movie . there are also some funny bits , many of which are intentional . however , there are also some unintentional funny moments . there are also times when the film degenerates into complete and utter chaos , with characters running around in what seems like an aimless fashion . the acting was decent for the most part , but at times there was some overacting going on . when all is said and done , i think Mortuary deserves a
472796	11423174	190374	6.0	a decent 90 minute diversion	i liked this movie better than most people . it has a very low user rating . i thought the movie was pretty good for the most part , though there were a few things that bothered me a bit . the biggest complaint i have is that the dragons are barely even shown in the movie , which is a shame , because i thought they looked pretty good . the other thing i didn't like was that the movie becomes muddled just over halfway through , and i could not make much sense of it . up to that point i liked it quite a bit . i also should mention that i thought some of the fighting scenes were not very good . there is lots of excitement in the movie , and i certainly didn't find it boring . i think it is well worth killing around 90 min or so . for me " Dungeons and Dragons " is about a
473537	11423174	181689	6.0	disappointing collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise	considering this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Cruise , it should be a great movie . but it's not . it's based on a short story by Philip K . Dick . this isn't a horrible movie , but it's just not really good either . i liked the futuristic concept , but the execution of it just doesn't deem to quite work . i found it boring and too long , and not very compelling . Spielberg is a gifted director , and tom Cruise has proved to have a great screen presence , if not great acting ability . but everyone is entitled to a few missteps in their career . this movie is certainly the exception for Spielberg and Cruise seems lacking his usual presence . when it's all said and done , it adds up to a blah experience . i guess it's a bit better than average , so i ' ' give it a
472800	11423174	199389	6.0	decent acting and great music elevate the movie	this is an OK TV movie , i guess . i think it's supposed to be a black comedy . it had some ironic moments , to be sure . i did not find it scary in any way , so i don't think it could be called a horror movie . i did think the acting was pretty decent . i really liked the soundtrack . i thought it was very unique . i felt it fit nicely withe movie . i did expect the movie to be better than it was , so in that regard , i found it a disappointment . it's a decent diversion if you want to kill 90 minutes , though i wouldn't say it's a brilliant movie , by any stretch . it was nice to see Judd Nelson in a different kind of role . i think he pulled it off well . not once did i think of the 80's teen movie " The Breakfast Club " which i think Nelson is well known for . to me , that's a sign of a good actor . and like i said , the acting was decent all around . it was just the movie itself that didn't quite work for me . I'll give " Cabin by the Lake " for the acting and the great music .
473401	11423174	265459	6.0	not quite fully developed	this is a foray into dark territory for Robin Williams . he plays a very disturbed and sick individual , who ends up stalking a family . this movie has potential written all over it . psycho stalks family and incorporates himself into their lives . so far , so good . now , enter Robin Williams as the psycho , something new for him . Does Williams live up to the challenge ? yes not only does he bring the disturbed man to life , he also brings some sympathy to the character . now , the character is certainly menacing , but the writing restrains the character . he could have really let loose and been even more psychotic than he is . the character is very low key and understated , not necessarily a bad thing , but in this case , i think they could have done more . while Williams acquits himself quite well with the material at hand , i thought the inclusion of Connie Nielson as the mother of the family being stalked was a master stroke . now , i'm not gonna say this was a bad movie , because it certainly isn't . i just think the main character and the story could have been more developed . my vote for " one Hour Photo " is
473759	11423174	88944	6.0	Mind numbing action film	this is a decent Arnold Schwarzenegger movie , but has less substance ( i , know , substance in an Arnie movie ? ) than his usual fare . this is pretty much mindless action . it seemed to movie like a movie that should have went direct to video . the story : a former commando's daughter is kidnapped and he has limited time to get her back alive . there isn't to much more than that . Arnie becomes a one man wrecking crew to get his daughter back . lots of mind numbing action and some great one liners from Arnie . of course you know how it will end up . but in case you don't , i won't go into detail . suffice to say an entertaining , but lacklustre effort , compared to say " Predator .
472842	11423174	385307	6.0	i thought it was more entertaining than number one	i thought his movie was more entertaining than the first one , but not necessarily funnier . i liked the banter and interplay between Sandra Bullock and Regina King . i did think that the story was bit thin though , but it is faster paced than the the original movie . i also felt it was more of a chick flick , but there's nothing wrong with that . if you don't like chick flicks , you might not like this one that much . there were also less funny moments in this one , but the funny moments were much funnier than anything in the first one . overall , i'd say i liked this movie a bit better . i wouldn't say it's great , but it's not half bad . for me , Miss Congeniality 2 : Armed and Fabulous is a
472981	11423174	486655	6.0	decent fantasy adventure movie	this fantasy adventure movie is not as good as i'd hoped , but it's still pretty good . it does plod along though for the fist 60 minutes or so , then it pickup for about 20 minutes . from there it slows down , but not as slow as it had been previously . the last 30 minutes are quite good , in my opinion . things really pick up here , with some great action and excitement . this movie has some original ideas in it , but it also borrows from other movies . there are some pretty big name actors in this one . and all put in terrific performances . Robert De Niro in particular , gets to have the most fun with his role , i think . he really lets loose . anyway , this movie definitely has its good moments . for me , Stardust is a
473788	11423174	377713	6.0	not quite as good as the other two in the series	i think this was a prequel to both cube and cube 2 ( possible minor spoiler ) based on how the movie ended . if i recall , it ties in with the beginning of one of those movies . i'm just not sure which . either way , i thought it was a good movie , though a bit slow at times . it gives an explanation of sorts as to why the people who in the cube are there . i wasn't completely satisfied with the explanation given , but at least they gave one . i i didn't think this installment is a as gory as the two previous . and to me , this movie also lacked the tense and suspenseful atmosphere of the other two . having said that , i caught it on premium cable , , and i think it's decent enough for that venue . i think it would be worth a rental , but i don't think i would purchase it . just my thoughts
473637	11423174	125439	6.0	slightly above average romantic comedy ( not one of Hugh Grant's best )	i didn't like this movie very much . i didn't think it was horrible , but i just found it slow for a romantic comedy . Hugh Grant is in this movie , along with Julia Roberts . i think Hugh Grant is very funny most times . but in this movie , he didn't seem as funny as usual . i watched about 45 minutes before my attention completely wandered , then i stopped the movie . Grant is also in " 2 Weeks Notice " , a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock . that movie i really enjoyed . i felt Grant and Bullock had great romantic and comedic chemistry . i didn't feel any chemistry between Grant and Roberts , for whatever reason . i will say that Rhys Ifans had some funny moments as the roommate of Grant's character . overall all though , i'd say this movie is slightly above average ( what i saw anyway ) but not enough to make me watch the whole movie . thus , my rating for " Notting Hill " is
472753	11423174	89013	6.0	great gory , disgusting fun	if you're looking for good acting and a good plot , this is not the movie for you . but if you like way over the top gore , with a soundtrack containing some great ( and not so great ) 80's hard rock and metal songs , this is your movie . the title might be misleading . the movie is about demons , but i thought they were more like zombies . smarter and faster maybe and with razor sharp claws and fangs , but zombies . the gore factor in this one is off the scale . the movie is entertaining , especially when you see these demons / zombies chasing people around to the the beat of some hard pumping metal tune . the whole thing plays pretty much like one long music video . i just thought it was great gory , disgusting fun . it's not high art , but then what horror movie is . for me , Demons is a
473776	11423174	356634	6.0	Garfield's first live action cinematic adventure	not too bad : is how i would describe this big screen adventure of the world's most famous fat cat , Garfield . Gafield himself is computer generated and well done , at , i might add . he is voiced by Bil Murray , who is a perfect fit for the character . Garfield , is of course very likable , as is the dog portraying Odie . the rest of the animal cast are all real live animals . well trained real live animals , some of whom are voiced by people . The two main human characters are also likable . some may found the story a bit weak , and rushed , but i thought it was good enough . it's simple enough to appeal to young children , but it's also amusing enough for adults . it does feel short at 80 minutes ( including credits ) but they do pack enough in there . i found it watchable , and amusing at times . was it the best movie i have ever seen ? of course not . but i found it worth the 80 minutes or so . i " d give Garfield a
473426	11423174	74968	6.0	mildly amusing caper comedy starring Don KNotts	in this sort of caper comedy , Darren McGavin and Don Knotss star as a safe cracker and his partner / lookout / getaway driver . both are softhearted and eventually get mixed up in a ( sort of ) kidnap scheme with a young girl and her brother ( who happen to have a penchant for mischief ) . anyway , the usual hi jinx take place . there's some physical comedy and some silly car chases . there's also some pretty bad overacting . but that's seems par for the course in a lot of Disney comedies form the seventies . it's all mildly amusing for the most part and it's entertainment the whole family can enjoy . for me , No Deposit , No Return is a
473285	11423174	82533	6.0	pretty decent for its time	just watched the howling a couple of night ago , and thought i would add my two cents . " the howling starts off as a movie about a serial killer named eddie ( played by robert ricardo , who would later play the holographic doctor on star trek voyager ) who wants to meet with newswoman karen white , played by dee wallace . karen meets with eddie and escapes being seriously injured or killed as the police arrive and eddie is shot and supposedly killed . karen is so traumatized by this event , that she is persuaded by a psychiatrist to take some time off and go to the " colony " to come to terms with the trauma . this is where the movie changes gears , as karen begins to hear strange howling sounds at the " colony " during the night . i won't reveal too much more except to say that the " colony " is not what it seems and its members hide a dark secret . as for the werewolves , they looked prety realistic but we hardly ever see them . there are a few scenes which are funny rather than scary and i'm not sure if they are intentional or not . there is one transformation scene which is pretty good . i didn't find " the howling " scary but it was a fun movie to watch . not quite as good as " american werewolf in London " which was made that same year and certainly nowhere near as good as " dog soldiers " but all in all a fun diversion with a bit of suspense thrown in for good measure . if you have nothing better to do , watch " the howling " . you will probably enjoy it . .
472899	11423174	469111	6.0	At least they didn't kill the hot chick right away	here we go again . another slasher flick , but with a twist-just kidding , at least about the twist . i was pretty bored through this one . first off the requisite nut bar doesn't even start killing people soon enough . and when said killings do occur , the death scenes are lame . the director tries to fool us with flashy camera tricks and loud music , but alas to know avail . this thing is predictable from the get go . the only question is who survives . i mean someone has to survive , so they can either be killed in the next ( i hope not ) installment or do the killing . naturally the characters are complete morons , even tasking stupidity to a whole new level in some scenes . so , nu-me nu-me nu-me , ( not an actual word , i know ) we sit and wait for them to be dispatched one by one . i did care when on of the characters got killed , because she is so hot . the bastards ! they have to kill the hot one every time . Oh , well , i keep watching , so what do i expect ? for keeping the hot chick alive for awhile .
473049	11423174	430239	6.0	great for gore hounds	i liked this movie . it's a bit slow at times , but it is enjoyable , for the most part . the creature isn't the most realistic i've seen , but i have seen a lot worse . there is lots of gore , so if you have a weak stomach , you might want to prepare yourself . but if you're a gore hound , you'll probably really like that aspect of it . there are no big name actors / actresses here , but i really liked the actress who played the female forest ranger . i thought she was very convincing . this won't likely be the best horror movie you ever see , but it's sure better than a lot of them out there . it has a rating on this site , but i would rate it higher than that . i give It Waits a
472605	11423174	84726	6.0	i think it's better than number one	i think this movie is a bit better than the first one . it starts off better , with some action right off the bat . it slows down somewhat not long after , but it's not as boring as number one . i think it is better paced , and i feel it is also is written better . the dialogue is more interesting . there is more of a story to this one , and the villain is pretty well defined . there is a bit of suspense and excitement in this one , which i found lacking in the first one . also the characters are given much more to do in this one . i do think the last 30 minutes or so kind of drag though . even though this one is better than the first , there is certainly room for improvement , in my view . its ' still not that great . i'll give Star Trek 2 : The wrath of Khan :
472994	11423174	963194	6.0	the not-too-distant future	this is certainly a different movie , to say the least . it's the first opera that i know of to contain goth , horror , fantasy and industrial music together and make it into a movie . it's based on a stage play of the same name . i didn't like this movie in the beginning . i found the first half painfully slow . but from that point on it picks up . there is some great art design her as well as some great set pieces . this is a very stylish production , and i liked the bleak vision it paints of the future and the grittiness . plus , it tells a good story . to me , it does echo other movies , like Sin City , and even the Kill Bill movies , in it's look . but maybe that's just me . there are a couple of scenes which may be grotesque to some people , so you should be aware of that going in . almost all of the dialogue is sung , since it is an opera . but isn't you typical opera . it's much more contemporary . for , me the 2nd half was strong enough to overcome the weak 1st half , so i give Repo : The genetic Opera a
473082	11423174	119363	6.0	has its good moments	this based on a true story movie is all right , i suppose . it involves a ban robber and his wife / partner , and the FBI as they try and stop him . problem is , he wears a good disguise and thanks to his wife ( the brains behind the outfit ) very organized . eventually the bank robberies escalate into shootings , and the move ends on a tragic , sad note . Unlike another In the Line of Duty movie , The FBI Murders , this one is not as brutally violent . it also moves a lot slower . the criminals in this one are shown to be more sympathetic . whether that's accurate to the real story , i don't know . Bruce Campbell ( The Evil Dead Trilogy ) and Lori Loughlin ( TV's Full ) House star as the husband and wife . both are decent enough . Loughlin was actually pretty good , transcending her all American girl image from Full House . i'd give this movie a
473046	11423174	377607	6.0	i didn't mind it ( i know , i must have a screw loose somewhere )	I'm pretty sure this is a straight to video movie . maybe i'm coming down with something , but i actually found it entertaining . it's not at all original and you can predict every single plot twist right off the bat . Erica Eleniak ( Under Siege ) plays Federal agent Kate Parker who is tasked with extraditing a fugitive named Claire Scott ( Brigitta Dau , " The Inheritance " , " When the Cradle falls " , both TV movies ) wanted in connection with a murder . you already know the rest , or you should , unless this is the first and only movie you've ever watched . just in case , here is the rest of the plot . complications ensue , people get killed , all ends well . like i said , i liked it - - well maybe not liked , but it was entertaining , for some strange reason . i mean , it shouldn't be . the acting is okay , i thought . Erica Eleniak , oddly enough has ( dare i say it ) some screen presence and her character is certainly no bimbo . i actually like the interaction between the middle aged , very much in love , husband and wife assassin team , Mr and Mrs . Jones , played by Stacy Keach and Erin Grey . i though they were quite amusing and i don't mean unintentionally . there is some really cringe worthy dialogue , i admit and you can tell it's B movie , obviously . All in all though , it passed the time and i didn't have to pay for it . based on it's entertainment value , i give " Caught in the Headlights " a solid
473061	11423174	379786	6.0	not exactly my bag , but still well done	i'm not sure , but it think this movie may be related to the TV series , Firefly or at least have a similar style . if that's the case , it would probably be better to be familiar with the show before watching the movie . i have not seen the show , so that may explain why i didn't get the movie . or not . anyway , i don't think Serenity is a bad movie . in fact , i think it's well done . it looks great , and there are some amazing fight sequences . nevertheless , i couldn't follow it . the dialogue was different , sort what i would expect to hear during the Civil War era or in the old west . so , some of the things they talked about , i wasn't quite sure what they meant or what context to put things in . anyway , this movie wasn't really my bag , but i think fans of Firefly and a lot of general science fiction fans will enjoy it . for me , even though it's not my cup of tea , i'd still have to give Serenity a , because it is so well done . but that's just my opinion .
473353	11423174	414853	6.0	better than average as an animated film and an animated comedy	hmmm . once again i'm amazed . i can't understand the low rating ( just over ) this movie has . i thought there were a few very funny moments in the movie , much more than " Over the Hedge " which has a rating of over . this movie is also touching in parts and i thought they achieved a good balance of humour and drama . while i wouldn't say it is hysterically funny , there are , like i said , some very funny moments . this movie is also a fun movie to watch . it is exciting , with plenty of action . this to me is a much better family movie than its rating reflects . id have to say it tries very hard to achieve its goal of being an animated comedy ( and succeeds often enough ) rather than just an animated film . " Barnyard " gets a .
472991	11423174	411061	6.0	decent time killer	i guess this wasn't a horrible movie . it just wasn't that great either . it's a pretty standard , generic crime drama / mystery . there are some scenes that could have been from any movie of the genre . AL Pacino is the headliner here , and looks like he's sleepwalking through the part . Leelee Sobieski , Deborah Kara Unger , Neil McDonough , and Alicia Witt also star . I like Alicia Witt as an actress , and she does OK here . in fact , i'd say she the best of the bunch . but she has little to work with . the movie itself is mostly implausible . it just doesn't add up . there's no real suspense or intensity . despite hat , i was entertained for the 101 minute running time . the movie is fairly fast paced . for me , 88 minutes is a
473116	11423174	99938	6.0	not a bad movie , but	i wouldn't say it's a comedy . it's not a bad movie . it's billed as part comedy , but i wouldn't really say it's a comedy . i think it's more a crime drama , with a bit of lite humour thrown in . there are one or two mildly amusing moments , but nothing i would consider funny . the premise is good . Arnold Schwarzeneggar plays a cop who has to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher . i think they could have exploited this fish out of water angle more in depth and longer . still the movie is actually entertaining for the most part , as a crime drama . Arnold again teams up with director Ivan Reitman ( their previous collaboration was Twins ) . i actually liked this movie more . Pamela Reed and Penelope and Miller also star , but both have less to do than i would have liked . Linda Hunt as the school administrator ( or principal , her title is never really mentioned ) is good , in what is basically a cameo . for me , Kindergarten Cop is a
473612	11423174	369735	6.0	almost mother-in-law from hell	Charlie ( Jenifer Lopez ) has had nothing but bad luck in the dating dept , going from one loser to another . One day , however , she meets Kevin Fields , ( Michael Vartan ) a successful doctor , and her life changes . Charlie and Kevin get serious and soon it is time to meet Viola , Kevin's Mother , ( Jane Fonda ) and break the news they are engaged . the meeting turns out to be a disaster . Charlie is convinced Viola hates her , but Kevin convinces her Viola will come around . Viola had fairly recently been fired unceremoniously from a storied news career and her mental health had taken a nosedive . she had been almost recovered and starts to slip again after hearing the news . anyway , Jevin and Charlie forge ahead with their wedding plans , with Viola doing everything ( but not really ) in her power to stop the impending nuptials . the best parts of this movie are watching Lopez and Fonda verbally and physically spar and try to one up each other . there should have been more of these confrontations and Viola could have been a much stronger villain , but as it is , she is undeserving of the title Monster-In-Law . the stuff before and in between is weak and uninspired , for the most part . However Wanda Sykes as Ruby , Voiola's loyal assistant , provides comic relief and makes this movie more watchable than it really is . Sykes is always brilliant , but underused and underrated in Hollywood . Vartan is okay as the love interest for Charlie , but is out of his depth . Fonda looks like she is having a lot of fun with her character , and Lopez though competent at times is not always convincing as the poor simple character , considering her real larger than life persona . the movie itself is entertaining enough , though forgettable , but you could do a lot worse .
473336	11423174	82869	6.0	" i was wrong about you , you're not stupid . you're crazy "	Outland takes place on one of Jupiter's moons . it stars Sean Connery as the newly arrived marshal for a remote mining colony located on the moon . he soon discovers some criminal activity and realizes that he may be in over his head as he tries to bring the criminals to justice . that's all i'll say regarding the plot , because i don't want to give anything away . the movie reminded me of Alien in its style , and in its bleak tone . i don't think it was as good as Alien though . i thought Connery was good as the marshal . i also liked Francis Sternhagen as the Dr . for the colony . i thought her character was interesting . James B . Sikking , John Ratzenberger and Peter Boyle , also appear in the movie , but their characters are peripheral at best , and undeveloped . as for the movie itself , it's not fast paced at all , but it is interesting and intriguing , just enough to see it through to the end .
473753	11423174	1028528	6.0	the woods are lovely , dark and deep . . . and i have promises to keep . . . and miles to go before i sleep	Quentin Tarantino's homage to 70's exploitation films is not as good as the other half of the Grindhouse feature , Planet Terror . this one has some really great 70's music and some good dialogue , although some of it seems contrived , and i just didn't think it was as clever as Planet Terror . it takes awhile too get going , and once it does get going , it's not bad , though not as exciting as it should have been . there's an ensemble cast here , and all are good . Kurt Russel is perfectly cast as Stuntman Mike , an insane driving terror , who happens to terrorize the wrong women and gets a taste of his own medicine . there's a lot of very frequent oars language here and a bit of gore . unfortunately , this movie just isn't as fun as i hoped . not horrible , just not great . for me , Death Proof is a
473522	11423174	839995	6.0	not any better or worse than the Richard Lester film	after watching this version of Superman II , i can honestly say , i didn't think it was any better or worse than the Richard Lester version . there are a few differences , which show that Donner had a bit different vision for the film , but overall , the film are pretty similar . you may notice a continuity problem because , Superman and Superman II , were originally filmed as one movie by Donner . but after Donner was let go , they decided to make tow separate film and retool the second one . either way , in my opinion , neither of the films are close to capturing the magic of the first one . still , it was nice to see the movie how Donner had originally intended it . for me , Superman II : The Richard Donner cut is a
473176	11423174	78966	6.0	has some tension , and good acting but is too slow	basically , a reporter and her cameraman discover a cover-up at a nuclear plant . it was alright , i guess . it had some exciting moments and some tension , and the acting is good , but it also seems too long . there are a lot of slow spots . Jack Lemmon , Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas star . Douglas looks quite different with a full beard . Wilford Brimley also stars in the movie . James Bridges directed the movie . he co-wrote The China Syndrome with T . S . Cook and Mike Gray . for me , this movie is no classic , though many people may disagree . if it didn't have so many slow spots , i would give it a higher rating . as it is , i give The China Syndrome a
472683	11423174	758758	6.0	a bit long at 148 minutes	this movie is basically about a man who abandons a life of comfort and gives away all his money to go live in the wild . along his journey , he meets some interesting characters and learns things about himself . it's another " based on a true story " movie . i liked some things about this movie , and didn't like some other things . i liked all the interesting people he met . i like the fact that he had the courage to live like he wanted to , not how society dictated . you might think he was crazy to live like he did , or you might think he embraced life . he did do some dangerous things , that's for sure . i liked the folk music soundtrack , and i thought he voice over narration from Jena Malone ( as his sister ) very effective . i didn't like the preachiness of the movie . and i also thought at 148 minutes it was too long . it's not what i would call fast paced . i also found it a bit depressing at times . generally though i found it interesting enough . for me , Into The Wild is a
473420	11423174	64276	6.0	interesting	at first , it seems this movie isn't really about anything . i mean other than two friends who are tooling across the country on a journey to nowhere . they drive around on the motorcycles living like gypsies , not welcome in any so called civilized establishment , like motels or restaurants . so they live outside , and they live by their own rules , free of responsibility . a lot of the time they are either stoned or in the process of getting stoned . and as it moves along , it's obvious that the movie is making a statement . the so called civilized folk , the ones who follow society , can't stand those who go their own way and do their own thing . in fact they are threatened by the very notion of freedom , so they denigrate and abuse those who don't follow along . in reality they long to be free themselves , but lack the will or the courage to do so . so , in order to make themselves feel better , they pick on outsiders . at least i think that's the issue the movie is trying to raise . in the era this movie was made , this was a really relevant issue . today , it's still relevant , but mainstream society has found other groups to pick on . if you don't fit into the strictures of rigid societal norms , you're bound to be victimized in some way . in my opinion , you should be able to live how you want , as long as you aren't harming others . nor should you denigrate other for their lifestyle choices . i think that's also the point the movie is making . or maybe i'm out to lunch . regardless , it's a different kind of movie , which does end up in bizzaro land for a bit . but , i think it's worth watching . for me , Easy Rider is a
473230	11423174	102926	7.0	very good , but Red Dragon is superior	i remember watching this movie a long time ago and not being all that impressed . but i watched it again last night , and i have a higher opinion of it now than i did before . it's a good film , there's no question . it's very moody and atmospheric , yet i still think Red Dragon is a superior film . however , did like a lot about " Silence . . . " . i thought Scott Glenn was excellent as Jack Crawford , Starling's ( Jodi Foster ) superior . i am not a Jodi Foster fan at all , however , she did well in this movie . i still think , though , that Julianne Moore's portrayal of Clarice Starling in Hannibal is superior . Hopkins is brilliant of course as Hannobal Lector . but Ted Levine is equally brilliant in his portrayal of " Buffalo Bill " . yes , " Silence . . . " is a very good movie , but what puzzle me is how people revere it as much as they do . it isn't that good . it will definitely give you chills and draw you in . the story is very compelling . having said all that , i give SOTL
473122	11423174	808238	7.0	suspenseful and intense ( i liked it )	i thought this was a pretty good movie . there's a lot going on in the 90 minute running time . the movie is suspenseful , and Jolene Blalock ( from Star Trek Enterprise ) shows she has some acting ability . the rest of the actors were OK , but nothing spectacular or anything . the movie is sort of predictable , with an ending that many viewers will see coming . but the fun is in getting there . the movie has a lot of intensity , something missing from a lot of movies of the genre . there is a side plot that does fit with in with the rest of the movie , though it is not readily apparent . throughout , the movie , there are a few potential suspects , and while i was pretty certain i had things figured out , i wasn't completely sure until the end . anyway , my vote for I Dream of Murder is a
473067	11423174	106850	7.0	good acting in a paint by numbers action / crime drama movie	( the following review / comment is my own personal opinion ) i found this movie entertaining . it is pretty fast paced and never really lets up . it's basically about an elite group of cops whose sole purpose is to tail the bad guys and learn their routine . then the nab them in the act . this sometimes results in people being victimized so they can have an air tight case against the bad guys . but the squad becomes more of a vigilante group , taking on the role of judge , jury and executioner . the movie is apparently based on a real squad that still exists today . but the events and the characters in the movie are fictional . there is fair amount of violence in this movie and a some pretty crude language . it's a pretty standard paint by numbers action / crime drama , but i think the acting performances elevated it quite a bit . Lou Diamond Phillips and Scott Glenn are the two main actors , but there are some great supporting performances . for me , Extreme Justice is a .
473498	11423174	367232	7.0	an entertaining comedy about a dysfunctional hospital and the dysfunctional interns ( among others ) that populate it	this is actually a pretty good movie . it does not rely on slapstick bit more on situational comedy . there are quite a few chuckles throughout , peppers with some hysterical moments . the movie flowed along nicely . the story is concerned with a group of interns and their exploits at the worst hospital in the country . the interns themselves are mostly dysfunctional as are the doctors , nurses and other staff . the hospital administrator is a bit odd , to say the least . it is very easy to like these characters , because they each have personalities ( with their own quirks ) that stand out . the acting is also good . you could do much worse with 2 hours of your life than this . i'd recommend it for a entertaining 2 hour diversion at the very least .
473034	11423174	73747	7.0	something's not quite right in Stepford	this is one creepy and suspenseful movie . unlike the remake , which was supposed to be campy and funny ( failing miserably ) the original is dark and works very effectively . you know there is something odd in the town of Stepford , but just what it is , is not really revealed until the end . even then , there is an air of mystery , as the reason for everything is not really revealed . the second last scene has quite a sinister feel to it . this is not a fast paced movie , it moves very slowly , with things happening subtly . nevertheless , i found it very interesting and intriguing . i thought this was a movie definitely worth watching . for me , The Stepford Wives is a
473056	11423174	91344	7.0	action packed and entertaining	my sister and i watched this sequel to the 1976 version of KIng Kong . and we actually both liked it . sure it's no masterpiece and i didn't like it quite as much as King Kong , but i did find it entertaining and fun . i felt it was on a smaller scope than KIng Kong ( 1976 ) and less serious , on my opinion , but it wasn't half bad . true , the dialogue won't win any awards , and the acting could have been better , but there was plenty of action and excitement . the story is bit of a stretch for sure , but if you don't take it too seriously , you might enjoy it for what it is : an action packed , entertaining 90 minutes or so . and it might make you forget about life for awhile . for me , King Kong Lives is a
472587	11423174	340331	7.0	pretty decent family movie ( with a couple minor swears )	this isn't too bad a movie . yes it can get preachy but it never really crosses the line into sap and drivel . it's mostly a family friendly movie with few minor swears . at first it feels quite light and fluffy , but if you stick with it , there are some deeper things going on here . David Paymer and Ryan Reynolds are the two bigger names in this movie , but it is Kate Vernon who really impressed me . as a matter of fact , i didn't recognize her while watching the movie . i only saw her name as the end credits rolled . before this had only seen her in very dark movies dealing with violent crimes . anyway , i did like this movie . it has a message , but it doesn't beat you over the head too much with it . also the movie is really touching at times , but in a good way . the acting is also good . i give " School of Life "
473391	11423174	43959	7.0	pretty good western	i thought this was a pretty good western . it contains most of the elements western contain , stagecoaches , robbers , and gunfights . and , there is the beautiful woman ( Susan Hayward ) and the man ( Tyrone power ) she is unwittingly thrown together with in a fight to survive . there is not a lot of action , in this particular western , but that's OK . the dramatic parts are well done , and the acting is very good . Power and Hayward acquit themselves quite well do quite well here , but Hugh Marlowe is really good as the chief Villain . Dean Jagger , Jack Elam and George Tobias also play villains with Jack Elam very strong here . there is some great chemistry / tension between Power and Hayward . as most western go this one follows the formula , so it's fairly easy to predict how thing will go . i will say , though , that the ending went a bit different than i had expected . overall , an enjoyable 86 minutes or so
473832	11423174	118571	7.0	typical action movie elevated by great supporting performances	this is a typical action movie . obviously it has lots of action , but there isn't much originality to the story . we've seen this movie before . the only difference is that some details are different and the title isn't the same . otherwise , there's no difference . OK , the actors are different . Harrison Ford plays the American president who becomes the reluctant action hero . he's OK , i suppose , but he seems to play every character he portrays in the same manner . they all sound and look alike to me . i liked Wendy Crewson as the president's wife . i thought she was credible in the part . i was also impressed with Glenn Close in her role as the vice president . but it's Gary Oldman , as the villain , who steals the show , in my mind . when you add everything up , the movie is entertaining , although less so than others of the genre . if it weren't for Wendy Crewson , Glenn Close and especially Gary Oldman , i would give this film a lower rating . as it is , i give " Air Force One " a
473542	11423174	444682	7.0	heavy on form , light on substance	this supernatural movie was decent enough , i guess . i'd call it a supernatural thriller , but it isn't really thrilling . there's zero tension or suspense . it's heavy on form , but light on substance . and there is really nothing new here . there are a couple of minor plot twists , but most people will probably see it coming a mile away . but the news into all bad . the movie moves along at a good clip , and it's certainly not boring . i also thought it was nice to see Hilary portray a more mature , conservative character and she does what she can with her character . the only problem is , the character is hardly developed at all . this is unfortunate , since she is the main character . AnnaSophia Robb is mesmerizing in her role . the rest of the performances are all decent enough . the movie itself is far from being bad . it's pretty decent , but not great . i think it's entertaining enough . my vote for The Reaping :
472584	11423174	457297	7.0	better than the first one	i actually thought this movie was better than the first one . it's not as dark as the first one . the main character was shallow and his motivation for altering his past or present starts out with good intentions but ends up being for selfish gain . so the main character isn't really likable . in fact , he's a bit of a wretch . but the movie does show the ramifications involved when history or the present is altered . one major bonus is the addition of Erica Durance ( TV's Smallville ) as the main character " s girlfriend . she is certainly quite beautiful , but she can also act . still i can't put my finger on why i like this movie better than the first . i guess it's just one of those mysteries . the only thing i can come up with is that this movie is better paced ( and more compelling ) , whereas i found thew first one boring at times . i give " The Butterfly Effect 2 a
472680	11423174	65150	7.0	a pretty good civil war era film starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson	i rather enjoyed this movie starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson . i found it fast paced and exciting . i don't think it had the epic feel of many of Wayne movies ( it feels like it has a smaller scope to it ) but it's still pretty good . i did think that the music was bit too much at times . it just got too loud and repetitive . the acting was pretty good , not only from Wayne and Hudson , but also from the supporting players , many big names of the time , and some yet to be . this is not the best John Wayne movie i have seen , but it is still very good and well worth watching . you could do a lot worse with your time . for me , The Undefeated is a
473412	11423174	87980	7.0	a moving portrayal of one man's journey of self discovery	The Razor's Edge is the story of a man who could have had a life of wealth , but decided he wanted more . he goes on a journey of self discovery and enlightenment . the movie based on the novel by W . Somerset Maugham ( The Painted Veil ) and the screenplay is co-written by John Byrum and Bill Murray . Murray is also the main character in the film . The story begins during the time of the 1st world war . Larry Darrel ( Murray ) goes off to fight in the war . the war has taken its toll on him emotionally and when he returns home he is a different man . and so he leaves for Paris and his journey of discovery begins . This movie is very dramatic , sedate at times , and hard to get through . it is at times very poignant and sombre . but it does have a message . sometimes we think we have everything , when in fact we have nothing . the most wealthy person may have little or no money , but can be rich , nonetheless . normally i don't go for the kinds of movies that have a moral to them . and that is because they usually hit you over the head repeatedly with the message . The Razor's Edge isn't that kind of film . everything about the film is subtle , so you really just come to you own conclusions . this is not a comedy , in fact if it were a play , it would be a tragedy . Bill Murray puts in a fine dramatic performance . Theresa Russel ( Wild things , Kafka ) Catherine Hicks ( 7th Heaven ) Denholm Elliot ( Raiders of the Lost Ark ) among others put in very good supporting performances . i would not recommend this movie to everyone . if you like your viewing experience to be filled with action , this is not your movie . if your tastes run more to the sublime , you will like this movie . i give this movie a strong
473212	11423174	240944	7.0	i didn't like it as much as the last 2 , but thought it was still better than the 1st on	this movie is bit different than the previous installments . this time Mercenary Carl Thomasson ( Treat Williams ) poses as a teacher in an elite military school . the reason , a friend Who also happens to be a general at the school , has asked Karl to help him eradicate the white supremacist element which has infiltrated the school . i didn't like this movie as much as i liked the previous 2 in the series . i did however , think it was better than the 1st one . there is lots of action in this 1 , just like the last 2 , so that can't be the problem . i think there may be 3 reasons why i didn't like this movie . the 1st reason is the setting . although the general plot of the movie differs very little from 2 and 3 , i think i just prefer these movie take place in a high school or university setting , not a military academy . i also didn't find the white supremacist angle very interesting . i think the filmmakers tried to add another dimension with that angle , but i think it was a bit too much for this kind of film , a bit too complex an issue . i prefer the simplicity of the 1st 2 . the other reason may be the fact that i am getting tired of the series and losing interest . whatever the reasons , this 1 is not quite up to par with the 1st two . i'd have to give " The Substitute 4 "
473347	11423174	97722	7.0	he did it his way	there are so many movies out there dealing with the problem of kids not learning anything in schools , and dropping out , ending up in a life of crime , or dead . but this movie came out at a time when these movies weren't so commonplace . Morgan Freeman plays Joe Clark , who has been recruited as principal of a once proud school , but one which has been overrun with hoodlums for years . the teachers are powerless to do anything , and the kids fall through the cracks . it's Clark's job to restore the reputation of the school and get the kids learning again . the movie is inspirational , for sure , and the commanding presence of Morgan Freeman lends it a lot of legitimacy . the only problem i found was that it is a bit long , and a few of the songs are a bit too maudlin . but that's just my opinion . it's still a good movie . for me , Lean on Me is a
473883	11423174	438097	7.0	sequel set during global warming ( thousands of years ago-take that Al Gore ! )	this sequel to Ice Age came out 4 years later , and is a pretty good sequel . i wouldn't say it's as funny as the original , but it does have quite a few laughs . there are a few more characters this time around , which i didn't like at first . i kind of preferred the intimate setting of the 1st , with only 3 main characters . but , once the movie got going , i got over it . instead of an ice age , this one is set during global warming-thousands of years ago , of course ( Ha ! , i knew global warming wasn't caused by humans ) anyway , this movie does tend to be a bit slow at times , but only for brief periods . Ray Ramano , john Leguizamo and Dennis provide their voices again , and are joined by Queen Latifah . this one is rated pg , and it does have some scenes of intense peril that might be too much for young children . there is also some very mild sexual innuendos , but these would be above the heads of any youngsters . as far as sequels go , this one is worth watching .
472978	11423174	372873	7.0	not too shabby , in my opinion ( but what do i know ? )	maybe i need to have my head examined , but i thought this was a pretty good movie . the CG is not too bad . i have seen worse . the look of the creatures ( and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake ) was pretty cool . the action scenes involving the snakes was really good , i thought . there are some lapses in logic at times , and the story doesn't always make sense . but for a creature feature , there are a lot worse . a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies , so it's not wholly original . i think the gist of the story is original though . there is a bit of similarity to Godzilla ( the Big budget American version ) which liked a lot . i didn't like this movie as much , but i still say it was pretty good . i also liked the music . all in all , i think Dragon Wars is about a
473724	11423174	97674	7.0	one of Pixar's early efforts	i thought this early animated short from Pixar was quite good . it's funny and ironic , plus it has a very catchy and infectious tune . it's also very low key , and movies at a nice sedate pace , which i liked a lot . it's from 1989 , so it's a lot different than the animated films we have today . it's a very simple short with a simple story . considering it is nearly 20 years old , it's actually very well done . it's also much more clever than many animated shorts from today , and certainly back then . i'd check it out if you have the chance . you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it . or you might not be . either way , it's not like you're losing a couple of hours . for me , Knick Knack is a
473887	11423174	299172	7.0	traditional style animation from Disney	this animated movie is actually pretty entertaining . there's an abundance of action , a good villain , and a couple of very funny scenes . the movie is sort of a cartoon western , done in the traditional animation style . there is lots to keep the viewer entertained . kids should like it , and adults will probably enjoy it as well . the good thing about this movie is it has a good story , and is well paced . there are even some musical numbers , ( of course this is not surprising , since most Disney movies do contain a musical element ) for people who might like musicals . " Home on the Range has something for everyone , although some of the action might be a bit intense for very young children . otherwise , a very good effort from Disney .
473352	11423174	400717	7.0	solid , very funny animated comedy	" Open Season " is a very entertaining animated film . i like the eclectic mix of characters . i really liked the dynamic between the 2 main characters , A domesticated bear named " Boog " ( voiced by Martin Lawrence ) and Elliot ( Ashton Kutcher ) a displaced mule deer with no family . i also though the dialogue was very good in this movie . there are some great one liners . there is also an abundance of action , ( some of it very funny ) and there are also some dramatic moments . dare i say it , this movie treads very close to being hysterical in some scenes . also , the choice of actors for the voices is brilliant in this movie , especially Lawrence and Kutcher . for me , " Open Season " gets a solid
473253	11423174	83511	7.0	pretty good odd couple buddy picture	this is is a pretty good action / comedy movie . it stars Nick Nolte as a hard nosed cop , and Eddie Murphy as a con who he gets paired up with to solve a crime . the movie moves at a great pace , and there are some great action scenes . the dialogue is also very good , especially the interplay between Nolte's no nonsense cop , and Murphy's smart ass ladies man convict . the 2 have great screen chemistry . both also put in great performances in this film . it is a bit more violent then i thought it would be , and there is a lot of coarse language , as well as some nudity . but none of that really effects the quality of the movie . it's a funny , action packed ride . my vote for 48 Hours :
473889	11423174	191397	7.0	heartwarming , funny	i enjoyed this sports comedy / romance . i found it funny , touching and engaging . it's not one of those bust a gut funny movies , it's more of the pretty good chuckles variety . it's one of those feel good kind of movies , where you just can't help but root for the guy and girl to get together . even the action bits ( mostly comedic football action ) are good . Gene Hackman and Keanuu Reeves are the headliners , but i found Brooke Langton to be very good in her role . it's nice to see Hackman and Reeves in a lite movie , rather than the intense movies they're usually known for . at the end of the movie , i felt pretty good . at the very least , you might forget about you problems for awhile . for me , The Replacements is a
473824	11423174	457430	7.0	very dark and disturbing ( in a good way )	i liked this movie quite a bit . it's a fantasy movie for adults . there is a bit of very graphic , realistic violence . there is also quite a bit of very strong coarse language . the movie is in Spanish or French , with English subtitles . the creatures in this movie look fantastic . i found them to be utterly realistic . but i wish we had seen more scenes of them , as they don't appear very often . the movie is very dark , and i could see how it would be scary to some people . there are some really nasty human beings in this movie and the creatures can be kinda scary . the one thing i noticed was that the story is lacking somewhat . it just doesn't seem as developed as i felt it could be . however , the acting and i still thought this was a pretty good movie . but parents should definitely use their discretion about allowing their kids to watch it . by the way , this two disc version has a raft of extras with it . anyway , for me Pan's Labyrinth is a .
473150	11423174	212338	7.0	a sometimes funny , often amusing , generally entertaining movie	Meet the Parents is not generally funny in a hysterical way ( though there are a few of those elements . the movie is more about the funny little things that occur when meeting the parents for the first time . anybody who has ever brought their Boyfriend / girlfriend or possible fiancé to meet their parents for the first time can attest to this . of course the same goes for the person meeting the parents . this is generally what the movie is about . there are some very funny moments in the movie , to be sure . and there are very amusing moments all through the film . the movie is not funny all the time , but is always entertaining . the movie stars Ben Stiller ( The boyfriend ) , Terri Polo , ( the daughter ) Robert Deniro ( the Father ) and Blythe Danner ( the Mother )
472595	11423174	106930	7.0	inspired by true events	this movie had a kind of ' movie of the week ' feel to . i don't mean that in a bad way . it is a very touching and heartbreaking movie , so you might want to have some Kleenex handy . it's the story of some kids from Texas who are caught in a flash flood on their way home from bible camp . the story is more personal , since it is on a smaller scale . i really felt for those kids as they tried to survive . i also really felt for the survivors who had lost loved ones and the parents of the ones who perished . this movie is not so much about a disaster , as it is about the human beings who survive and how they and their families cope with the tragedy and the realization of loss . i thought this movie explored that aspect very well and was well acted . it is a hard movie to watch , even more so , because it is inspired by a real life tragedy . it's hard to say i enjoyed this movie , because of the subject matter . so , i have to base my rating on the acting , which is the focal point of the movie , and the strongest . on that basis , i give ' Flood . Who will save our children '
473565	11423174	90021	7.0	entertaining werewolf movie	just watched silver bullet and i enjoyed it . it was entertaining and well paced , though not particularly scary . the music was quite ominous and suited the movie well . most of the characters were two dimensional at best , but the actors did a good job with what they were given . i didn't feel much emotional investment for any of the characters . the creature effects were okay and we really only get a full view of the creature in one scene . despite all this , i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again , though not for awhile . the film was unique in one aspect , which i won't give away , so you'll have to watch it to find out . it is definitely worth renting , or buying if you can find it cheap . i paid ten bucks for mine and got my moneys worth . in short , you could do a lot worse .
472813	11423174	97733	7.0	more fun and mayhem with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover ( and Joe Pesci )	the rating for this movie on this site is , which i would have to agree with . to me , this is a better movie than the first one . it's got much more action , it's more exciting , and faster paced . it's also funnier . the characters are better defined , and the storyline is better . i also think this movie had a better villain than the first . this time , along with Danny Glover and Mel Gibson , Joe Pesci is along for the ride , and provides some laughs . also , there is more banter between Gibson and Glover . the movie is just more compelling all around . the first one was a bit slow at times , but not so with this one . for me , Lethal Weapon 2 is a
473893	11423174	167190	7.0	entertaining , but missing something ( )	i kinda liked this offering from Guillermo Del Toro . it's a sort of science fiction action adventure hybrid , with some humour thrown in . there's a great mix of oddball characters , some good stunts , and the look of the film is fantastic . the movie also has a great assortment of weird creatures . yet i came away feeling a bit empty , like there was something missing . despite all the good things about the movie , i guess i felt it had very little heart or soul . having said that , from a shallow point of view , i liked it . it isn't boring . i just think it had the potential to be more . when you add it all up , my vote for Hellboy is a
472799	11423174	283974	7.0	a bit better than the 1st one	as a sequel , this is not a bad movie . i actually liked it better than the 1st one . i found it more entertaining . it seemed like it was shot documentary style . at first this bothered me , as i thought it just looked too low budget . but it grew on me , and it made the movie seem more authentic . this movie has more dry one liners than the original , which is a good thing , in my opinion . i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters . it almost becomes a parody of itself , which may be the point . this movie at least has some suspense , which the 1st one did not have , in my view . it has some of the same great music from the original , which is great . the acting again was pretty decent for the most part , though like i said , some of it seemed over the top . i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow , like the rest of the movie . overall , though , i thought this was a pretty sequel . my rating for " Return to Cabin by the Lake " is
473543	11423174	330267	7.0	OK , but loses its focus at times ( )	for the most pat , this documentary is pretty decent viewing . it's mainly about the German juggernaut war ship Bismark and it's sinking . it gives a bit of a brief history of the ship . the some battle scenes are shown , many computer animated . the ship is shown as it sinks int the water under a barrage of British fire from most of the British fleet . meanwhile James Cameron and his crew prepare to explore the wreckage of the ship on the sea floor , using two submersibles . the footage of the ship 61 years almost to the day that it was sunk is pretty impressive . you get a real idea of how massive and well built the ship was . Cameron's crew were also able to enter the ship through many different holes , some caused by enemy artillery . you get an idea of what the inside of the was like . along with Cameron and company are two survivors of the sinking . there are a few things I didn't like here . one is that they never really had the two survivors relate much of their story , which would have been nice . another thing is i felt it took too long to get to the point where they were exploring the wreckage . also instead of letting the viewing just enjoy what they are seeing , sometimes Cameron and crew throw in some " ooh " and " ahh " comments . the documentary focuses a bit too much on the scientists and the technicians , which is not really interesting . there are a few scenes i thought they could have left out , which had very little to do with anything . other than that , though , it wasn't too bad . the computer animation was outstanding . i should qualify this by saying that this version is a two disc set , which contains special features . one of the feature is called Behind the Scenes , which has a featurette entitled Survivors . i haven't watched any of the features , but this one presumably focuses on the two survivors who are with the expedition . how in depth , i don't know . either way , though that footage should have been included in the actual feature . for me Expedition Bismark is a
472953	11423174	903135	7.0	decent animated movie , for the most part	right off the bat , i have to say that this film is not half bad . there's plenty of action , lots of explosions and some decent villains . if you are a fan of the comic book , you might not like it , because as far as i know , it is not that faithful an adaptation . also , the origin of Iron Man as told in this movie , is in my opinion , weak and much too brief and definitely is not faithful to the comic book . but there are plenty good things about the movie . the voice actor fit very well with their roles and the story was pretty good and the decent villains , which i mentioned earlier . as animated movies go , this 1 is pretty good . in my opinion ' The Invincible Iron Man ' is about a
473333	11423174	83943	7.0	entertaining and tension filled	this was a pretty entertaining movie . i thought it was well paced , even the dramatic scenes . it's set during the cold war , when The Soviet Union and the U . S had high tensions between them . Clint Eastwood is good as a former American fighter pilot who still has flashbacks from Vietnam and hasn't flown for years . he is enlisted to steal a state of the art Russian jet so the U . S . can study its capabilities and make sure they don't fall behind in their Technology . Eastwood is good as the hero , and he also directed the picture . there's some great tension and suspenseful moments here . the flying sequences were really good at times . at other times , they are dated and don't look very realistic . still , the movie is fun , and i like the story . for me , Firefox is a
472611	11423174	21746	7.0	epic 1930 Western	Cimarron traces the early history of Oklahoma , starting with the land rush in 1899 . from there it spans forty years in the development of that land into an eventual American state and the advances of technology that came with it . the story itself is an epic tale , so its focus is pretty broad . this sort of makes it a bit impersonal at times . it starts off slow , but somewhere along the lines it picks up and becomes somewhat compelling . i also found it interesting how people behaved back in that time , at least according to the movie . it does feel a bit like a silent movie at times . some of the acting feels over exaggerated . that sort of makes sense , since talking pictures had just recently replaced silent films as the movie medium . so , many of the actors would have been used to acting in silent pictures . nevertheless , i still enjoyed it , for the most part . for me , Cimarron is a
472782	11423174	98844	7.0	the lesser of the three , but still good	of the three law and Order shows , this is my least favourite . it's much slower than both of the other ones . there isn't ' usually a lot of action . there's a lot more dialogue in this one , and the dialogue is usually pretty well written . i like the banter back and forth between the main characters . also , there is a fair amount of humour in this entry , which i like . of course it's gallows humour , or black humour . Criminal Intent has almost no humour , while SVU has some , but to a lesser degree . the show does not delve into the personal lives of its characters at all . i still find it interesting , all things considered . for me , Law and Order is a
472541	11423174	120812	7.0	Chan and Tucker make a great odd couple team	this is a pretty good movie . it's an action adventure comedy . there is a lot of action and the movie is fast paced . there isn't a lot of comedy , but comedy bits there are , are pretty funny . Jackie Chan's acrobatic , over the top cartoonish martial arts moves are funny . Chris Tucker's motor mouth character is pretty funny at times . also the teaming of Chan and Tucker is a great idea . they work well off each other . one could not be more opposite from the other . i liked their back and forth banter . the other thing i like about this movie is that even though there is some violence , it's not excessive , and there is a bit of coarse language , but not very much . for me , Rush Hour is a
473845	11423174	237534	7.0	unseen beast goes on killing spree in 1776 France ( the story may have a kernel or two of truth to it )	this movie may or may not have been inspired by real events . if it was , i'm sure a lot was changed for dramatic effect . it take place in France during the reign of King Louis XV in 1776 . it chronicles the hunt for a an unseen and unknown beast that has responsible for many deaths and has paralyzed the citizens with fear . two men with special talent are dispatched to find and destroy the monster . i won't give any more away plot wise . however , i will say , this is not a horror movie . that is , it's not really scary . there is a definite pallor of death throughout the movie . there is some suspense of sorts in the movie and fair amount of action , with some great fight scenes . the film also has it's lighter moments , with some amusing scenes . one knock i have against this movie , is that the beast is not what you might think . in fact it is kind of a disappointment when it is revealed . however , i do like the reason given for the killing rampage . i thought it was kind of unique . the movie is a France / Canada production , so you can watch it with English subtitles , or you can watch the dubbed version . i watched the dubbed version and was very impressed with the quality of that aspect . the dubbing is very good . as for the movie itself , it clocks in at 162 minutes , but i never found it boring . for me , " Pacte des loups , Le " , AKA " Brotherhood of the Wolf " is a
473422	11423174	100994	7.0	a much better movie than the first one	i have to say , i thought this movie was way better than the first one . i felt the there were more action sequences , and they were better done . i also thought this one was more fun . even though most of cast returned from the first one , i felt the acting was better here . maybe the 3 year wait between films really matured some of the actors skills . plus , i really liked the addition of William Peterson , and Alan Ruck . as well , i really liked the music in this one . beyond that , though , i just thought the story was better , and flowed much more smoothly . this is actually what the first movie should have been , in my view . for me , Young Guns II is a
473852	11423174	422528	7.0	i liked it ,	but not because it is funny . it isn't funny . but it is immensely entertaining . Sarah Silverman is a very talented story teller . most of the show is Sarah Doing stand up comedy , and most of it improv , i think . i also like how Sarah just flies by the seat of her pants , ( or at least appears to ) coming up with stuff on the fly . their is also a lot of free association and Sarah segues very easily from one topic into another . that is the true genius of Sarah Silverman . you never really know if if the material is all planned out in advance , or if Sarah just think this stuff up as she goes along . she is certainly vulgar and crude , and very politically incorrect . no topic or ethnicity is spared in this show , including Sarah'a own Jewish heritage . Sarah says whats on her mind , and isn't worried about what others think about her . i find that refreshing . but it is apparent that this is just her stage persona . an alter ego if you will . however , this show is not for everyone . many people will be offended by this type of material , and anyone in that category should avoid this DVD . for people who don't mind this type of material , you will probably be entertained , and you may even laugh . for me , Sarah Silverman : Jesus is Magic is a
473127	11423174	242998	7.0	above average for the genre	as far as horror movies go , this one isn't bad at all . in fact , it's pretty decent . i think one of the reasons is that it also liter in tone than most of the genre . in fact , i'd even goes as far as to say it's a horror / lite comedy . there are some good lines in here and some funny scenes which work well . the movie is also a bit of a guessing game , as there are a few possibilities as to who the killer is . and even at the end , there is a bit of ambiguity . but it works here . as far as the acting goes , i think it's certainly more than adequate for this genre . and the movie doesn't really over do it on the gross out factor . most of the deaths are not very graphic , which i didn't mind in this movie . also , the characters aren't your typical stupid people that usually populate theses kinds of movie . i also liked the music . it was refreshing for this genre . when you add it all up , i think Valentine is an above average movie for the genre . my vote :
472900	11423174	89601	7.0	light hearted teen sex romp circa 1956 , in small town U . S .	as teen sex comedies go , this one has a lot going for it . it is well written , good characterizations , humorous situations and a great 1950's soundtrack . as well , the actors were credible and the depiction of small town , Ohio , in 1956 seemed authentic . the humour wasn't so much the laugh out loud bust a gut variety , but more of the situational type . you also had to laugh at how people dressed and how they acted back then , also how repressed they were . it's almost absurd really . i really got a kick out of the fascination with James Dean . i don't get it , but it is amusing . there is some sexual situations in this movie and one full frontal female nudity shot , so if that offends you , this is not the movie foe you . for the rest of us , this is an enjoyable , ( if light ) entertaining diversion .
473078	11423174	851851	7.0	first season shows potential for the series	since i've only seen the first season , that's all i can comment on . based on this first season , i think the show has potential . it starts off slow but gradually picks up steam and becomes interesting . the ending of season one is was quite good and i eagerly await for season await the arrival of season 2 on DVD . there are some things i hope they do to improve the series . on is to add a bit more humour . the show tends to be dour and depressing at times . they could also make it a bit more exciting , not so much dialogue . otherwise i hope the network gives the show a chance and keeps it on the air . for me , Terminator : The Sarah Conner Chronicles is a
473045	11423174	418773	7.0	very powerful , moving , heart wrenching drama that is worth watching if you stick with it	i really wanted to hate this movie . in fact , i considered shutting it off more than a few times . the first thought i had was " talk about some fd up , moronic , dimwitted imbeciles . that seems to describe many of the characters in the movie . other than that we have a real a-hole , a woman who cares about nothing except money and her self . there is also , a bickering wife and the most sane person is the husband who barely says 2 more than 2 words most of the movie . however , i stuck with the movie , and i'm glad i did . many of the characters changed for the better somewhat before the movie ended . the movie is billed as part comedy , but it isn't really funny . it is very dramatic , very dialogue driven . it is also heart wrenching at times . i'll admit , i bawled and blubbered heavily towards the later stages of the film . Amy Adams blew me away with her performance , starting off as a simple country girl , who seems a bit dull , at first , but becomes really endearing as the movie progresses . this movie is very bleak in its tone and deals worth some very heavy issues . i am glad that i saw the movie through , even though i didn't get it all . i know i'm being very vague about the movie , but trying to describe it in depth is too difficult , as there is so much going on . it is a very complex movie . it is truly a unique viewing experience do recommend it , but be prepared to experience some strong emotions and shed some tears .
472519	11423174	418763	7.0	a pleasant surprise	i had no interest in seeing jar head . judging by all the previews , i thought it would be just another boring war movie , at best . however , my buddy had taped it so we decided to give it a try . after all , we had just sat through the train wreck that was silent hill , and it couldn't be any worse . turns out , it was quite a well done movie . its depiction of a company of marines and their lives , during dessert shield and dessert storm , was , i'm sure , an accurate portrayal of military life . giving this movie extra credence is that it is adapted from a novel by Anthony Swofford , who was himself a marine during both dessert shield and dessert storm . The book and the movie chronicle his experience during that time . and while the producers may have taken some dramatic liberty , i believe it does stick close to the facts . Jake Gyllenhall does well as the title character , and Jamie Foxx is very strong as Staff Sgt . Sykes his , commanding officer . Peter Sarsgarrd is also strong as Troy , a fellow marine and friend . and i can't forget Chris Cooper who has a small and memorable role as well , which he infuses with his usual brilliance . I believe the filmmakers did a good job depicting life as a marine waiting for action in Kuwait . the film is well paced , and tightly directed , with very few unnecessary scenes . there are also touches of humour injected into the film . for a movie of this genre , it is surprisingly lighthearted for the most part . it did not feel heavy handed at all , and did not have the cloud of depression hanging over it as most war themed movies do . it did have its dramatic moments of course , but these moments did not oppressively choke the film . all in all , a solid , entertaining piece of work .
473917	11423174	113041	7.0	not bad for a sequel	as sequels go , this is film isn't too bad . i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one , but it's not a bad effort . i didn't find it as funny , and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me . really , this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first . through much of this movie , i was all too aware i was watching a movie , whereas with firs tone , i was drawn in , and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting . having said that , there are some bright spots . for , one , this movie is just as touching as the first . and Eugene levy has a great cameo . and there is still some fun to be had . even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above , i still think Father of the Bride II is a
472788	11423174	301454	7.0	not bad , but not as good as the original	in many ways , i thought this movie was not as good as the 1st . yes , it is truer to the animated show in many respects . in fact , id say it is too true to the cartoon . in this case , the cartoon does not translate too well into live action . in the 1st , they veered away from the cartoon quite a bit and that worked for me . in this movie , " Dr Claw " seemed way too over the top and not in a good way . the character sounded more stupid than anything . i think they tried too hard to make him seem evil and instead made him a caricature . the henchmen were dimwitted , just like the cartoon , but that seemed to work in this movie . most of the humour is of the type that young kids would find funny , but most adults probably wouldn't . as for the title character , i found he was was too idiotic ( it worked in the cartoon , but not here ) , at 1st , but after awhile he became somewhat endearing . there are few things a liked about the movie . i liked the fact that Penny had a bigger role to play , and i also liked the fact that Gadget had some competition / decent romantic interest . overall , though , i didn't think this movie measured up to the original . though it had its moments . for me " Inspector Gadget 2 " is a
473842	11423174	120742	7.0	the best of the trilogy	in my opinion this is the best of the trilogy . i laughed out loud a few times in this one . but more than that , i just thought the story was better . there were some great lines delivered in this one , many courtesy of Bob Uecker , who played Harry Doyle , the goof ball play by play man . again there are some oddball characters with some strange rituals . i also thought the movie flowed more smoothly and it was better paced . there was also a love interest for one of the characters in this one , although admit it wasn't a substantial part of the movie . but at least there was one . as far as i can recall , there was no love interest of any consequence in the previous two . if i'm wrong , please tell me so . anyway , overall a pretty good movie . for me , " Major League 3 : Back to the Minors " is a
473529	11423174	446809	7.0	starts off slow , becomes interesting	starting off , i was not impressed with this reality series . the first episode starts off slower than molasses uphill in January . eventually it picks up . the second episode is much better , as we get into the action much quicker . the show is interesting , showing what the crab fishermen go through and how grueling it is . it also shows how dangerous it is . apparently there is an almost 100 percent injury rate and a very strong risk of death or permanent injury . it is obviously very dangerous . however , some of these crab fishermen could make enough money in weeks or less to live for an entire year . in any event the show is amusing , entertaining and sad all at once . i would give " Deadliest Catch : Crab Fishing in Alaska "
473508	11423174	316732	7.0	entertaining fast paced , odd couple buddy movie	i picked up this movie really cheap , and wasn't expecting too much . turns out , it's not half bad . yes , Jimmy Fallon's character is annoying at first , but he kinda grows on ya . once you get past that , the movie's all right haven't seen Queen Latifah in too many movies . in fact , i think the only movie i had seen her in previously was Bringing Down the House , which was a real dog , but that isn't her fault . the movie just simply sucked . in " Taxi " she actually has a movie to work with . i really liked her character , especially her sassyness . her and Fallon really work well off each other . they're definitely the odd couple but it works . there are a couple of pretty funny moments and some good lines , but i won't say the movie is hilarious . it is entertaining and exciting . it also the " babe " going for it . in other words - - hot chicks . put all that together and you have a pretty good movie . for me , " Taxi " is a
472574	11423174	118526	7.0	heart wrenching story	as this movie starts , a voice comes on as wells the words , saying that although his story is fictionalized , it is inspired by a true story . it's all bout how the medical community is unwilling to think outside the box when it comes to alternative treatments for sick people , that they don't approve of . one family learns this the hard way , when their young son is struck ill , and despite not getting better in hospital , the doctors want to continue to try treatments that don't work . this movie is heart wrenching at times , and frustrating . Meryl Streep and Fred Ward star as the parents who are running out of options for their son and are at their wits end . Streep and Ward both are great here . Allison Janney ( The West Wing ) also puts in a good performance . too be fair , not everyone in the medical establishment is unwilling to think out of the box , and the movie shows this as well . for me , First do no Harm is a
473291	11423174	97458	7.0	not to be confused with the " Anatomy " horror movies	i liked this movie . it's about first year medical students and what they go through . it focuses specifically on a small group of five in particular . it's a drama more than anything . it the first half of the movie is pretty light in tone , but the second half is much more serious in tone . in fact , there are two heartbreaking scenes in the second half , which got me pretty emotional . but that's just me . this is a very much a character and story driven movie and it succeeds , in my mind , at least mostly . the acting is pretty good . Matthew Modine , Daphne Zuniga and Christine are the main actors . all are likable characters , in their own way . . overall , well written , well acted movie . not great , but pretty good . for me , " Gross Anatomy " is an
472967	11423174	120667	7.0	decent superhero film , though not of the epic scale	this movie was certainly entertaining , although it felt a bit incomplete somehow . it is certainly not a movie you would call epic , by any means . it is much more low key than your typical blockbuster movie , i . e the Spider Man or X-Men series . i believe the filmmakers were going for blockbuster status , but the film did not reach that level . from both a critical and artistic standpoint , this movie was received lukewarmly at best ( although some critics and fans praised it . ) one of the problems is that the story could have been developed better . the filmmakers focused more on style than substance . the special effects were pretty decent , although at times they were a little hokey . this is probably due to the relatively low budget of 80 million dollars . also some of the dialogue was cringe worthy at times . however , the acting was solid , their was plenty of action and the film was not boring . However , like i said , the story was sacrificed for style . there is a sequel in the works . let's hope it's more fleshed out . as for this film , despite a few flaws , it was relatively well made . this film gets a strong
473624	11423174	105219	7.0	great fight sequences and screen presence of Brandon Lee elevate this movie	i watched this movie years ago , and thought it was nothing short of astonishing . i guess our tastes change as we grow older . don't get me wrong , i still think it's a fairly decent movie . the problem is , many movies of this genre could be considered fairly decent . ( and many would not be ) there are 2 things which set this movie apart from some in the genre . 1 is the fantastic and spectacular fight scenes . the other is the screen presence and charisma of the late Brandon Lee . without these 2 elements , i think this movie would be slightly above average . as a matter of fact , i was bored at times and thought the movie dragged . as it is , however " Rapid Fire " gets 3 . 5 stars from me .
473802	11423174	268397	7.0	funny and colourful	this is a pretty decent cg animated movie from Nickelodeon . it's funny at times , has quite a bit of action and a mostly interest sustaining story . it's obviously geared towards kids , but adults will laugh at some of the jokes . it does have a few slow moments , but mostly it's pretty well paced . some of the character are a bit creepy looking , especially the teacher . but there's nothing that could be considered offensive . it's also very colourful , so the kids will love that aspect of it . most adults will be able watch it without falling asleep , but if not , the kids are perfectly safe watching it on their own . for me , Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius is a
472636	11423174	95253	7.0	pretty decent John Candy film	while i don't think this is the best John Candy movie made , it is still pretty good . i guess it's considered a classic by now , being over 20 years old , and i think it deserves that status . it certainly has its funny moments . and John Candy is just so likable , how could you not like him . Dan Akroyd is also in the movie and he does good in his role . it's a quality family movie , but there is a bit of mild language and implied sexual innuendo . still , i don't think it's anything the whole family couldn't watch , except maybe really young kids . there is a lot of improvisation going on in this movie , which i really liked . the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that it takes a bit of time to get going . other than that that , it's a pretty good offering .
473627	11423174	108556	7.0	i thought it was eerier and had more a sense of urgency than the original ( but that's just me )	in my mind , this sequel to the original " When a Stranger Calls " ( 1979 ) is actually a better movie . i thought the story was better , with a better , much creepier and more intelligent villain . Carol Kane reprises her role from the original , and i actually thought she did a convincing job in this 1 . i think that's because she plays an adult , and not a teenager . there are some interesting twists and the villain has more dimension . the overall look and feel of the film is much eerier than the original . to me , there is more of a sense of danger and distress . i have to admit the hairs on my neck stood up more than a few times . there is 1 real nail biting scene which kept me on the edge of my seat . for other recommendations , check out the review i did on the original . as for " When a Stranger Calls Back " , i give it
473767	11423174	95344	7.0	teenage girls make a random prank call to the wrong guy	i really enjoyed this movie . it is a remake of a 1965 film , starring Joan Crawford . I haven't seen the original , so i can't compare the two . However as a stand alone film , it is surprisingly entertaining . the premise : two bored teenage girls decide to make random prank calls , saying " I saw what you did , and i know who you are " , just to see what kind of reactions they can get . all harmless fun , of course , until they call Adrian , an emotionally unhinged man , who has just murdered his girlfriend . you can guess the rest . the movie is predictable of course , but is entertaining . the two leads , Shawnee Smith , and Tammy Lauren are well played and it is easy to get into the movie . not a lot of suspense , well , no more or less than other movies of the genre . The one disappointing thing is that Candace Cameron is billed as the star of the film . Don't believe it . she has a small role as the young sister of one of the teens . i get the feeling that Shawnee Smith was being groomed to become a big star . That didn't exactly happen , and i'm not sure why . However , she has made comeback of sorts with the " Saw " franchise . anyway . . . i'm kind of mystified that the original version of this movie has been released , but not this version . This is better than most films of the genre , i think maybe due to the performances . i give it
473494	11423174	116287	7.0	pretty decent thriller	this turned out to be a pretty good thriller . i say turned out because it starts off slow and takes awhile to build up some steam . but once it gains momentum it maintains it throughout . there isn't a lot of suspense here , but the movie makes up for it in thrills . there are some pulse pounding moments that had me on the edge of my seat . there are also some pretty graphic scenes , and some sudden , shocking moments , as well as a fair amount of coarse language . there are some good actors in this one , including William ( TV's CSI ) Petersen , Reese ( the Legally Blond movies , Walk the Line ) Witherspoon , Alyssa ( the TV series Charmed ) Milano , Amy ( TV's Judging Amy ) Brenneman and Mark ( Shooter , The Departed ) Wahlberg . there's also some good character development as well . all in all , like i said , a pretty good thriller . for me , Fear is a .
472719	11423174	336325	7.0	not as good as Dracula 2000 , but not bad ( )	this is a sequel to Dracula 2000 , but not completely . it's still about Dracula , but it begins shortly after the first one ended . the thing is , spoiler ahead it ignores the ending of 2000 . if you paid attention to the very end of that film , you'll realize that the events in this one couldn't happen the way they do . end of spoileroh , well , that's life . it still has the same biblical bent to it . but this one lacks many of the things 2000 had . gone is Gerard Butler as the title character , a fairly big loss , in my opinion . this Dracula ( the character ) is not as compelling , nor did i feel he was seductive or charming . gone is also the visual style of 2000 . there's also no macabre humour here . nor is there much action . what is added is some overacting by many of the cast involved . While i don't have anything against Jason Scott Lee , i feel he was trying way too hard to make the character serious . minor spoileroh , and if you're expecting to see Roy Schieder ( he is billed as being one of the stars of the movie ) then you better not blink , or you'll miss him . overall , this entry is not as fun as Dracula 2000 , but i still thought it was OK . For me , Dracula II : Ascension is a
472537	11423174	327554	7.0	a fun movie , undeserving of all the harsh criticism	i don't understand why so many people hated or disliked the movie catwoman . i thought it was a fun movie to watch . the acting was pretty good . i liked the villain . there was lots of action and i loved the music . also , Halley berry is very sexy and looked great in the catwoman costume . i liked the mysticism involving cats . i thought that was unique . i also like the fact that instead of the usual male villain , we have a strong female villain , played by sharon stone . she did a good job in the role , i thought . i liked how catwoman was self conflicted about being evil versus being good and the suduction it held . i bought this movie and have watched it more than once . i enjoyed it and will watch it again . i just wish people would lighten up . 6 & out 10
473013	11423174	89767	7.0	Eastwood directs and stars	like many of his western character , Eastwood starts in this film as a quiet mysterious loner . he ends up helping people out , and ends up on someones else's ' bad side as a result . his character is known as Preacher in the movie , but he's not you typical preacher , and he's much more than that . Eastwood also directed and produced this film . this isn't an action packed western . it's more drama than anything , but the dialogue is good , as is the acting . John Russel is particularly impressive , who plays a lawman of sorts . even though he has a pretty small role , he has great screen presence and charisma . as far as western go , this one sticks to most of the tried and true conventions , but the characters are interesting . not one of the best westerns ever made , nor one of Eastwood's best as either director or actor . still , it is a decent 115 minutes or so . my vote for Pale Rider :
473657	11423174	37343	7.0	a pretty good John Wayne picture	i thought his was a pretty good John Wayne film . sure , a lot of the movie is typical of most westerns in many ways , but in other ways , it isn't . for example , i thought the story was a bit more fleshed out and interesting , and there is an air of unpredictability to it . there is not as much action as many of Wayne's films , but there is enough to satisfy . of course , there is some humour involved , and just like many westerns , there's a mix of odd characters , which i liked . this is not an epic film , by any means , but it's not supposed to be . the movie kept me interested right to the end , and when it was over , i felt satisfied . for me , Tall in The saddle is a
473323	11423174	116253	7.0	solid nail biting suspense flick with above average action sequences	i had watched " Executive Decision " maybe 5 years ago and i remember enjoying it then . however , i was more impressed this time . Kurt Russel does a good job as on of the heroes of the piece . a great supporting cast surrounds Russel . Halle Berry is very convincing in her role . Steven Seagal makes an appearance , giving another one of his usual wooden performances . thankfully he is not the star of the movie . there are some great action sequences , but the film's focal point is more one of dramatic suspense . and there are some nail biting moments . these are handled very well by both the director and the actors . The bad guys are well represented , all giving fine performances . The main villain is played by brilliant actor David Suchet , who really inhabits his character . you really hate this guy . There is not a lot of character development , but that does not detract from the quality of the film . the script is very tightly written , which helps to overcome the very unlikelihood of the plot . the only other minor complaint i have is that in some of the flying scenes , it is apparent that the scenes are simulated . but this is a minor issue . overall an above average suspense / action flick
473775	11423174	455499	7.0	more fun the the first one	i thought this movie was better than the first one . there is a bit more going on in this one , and kids will love the sometimes chaotic atmosphere . there i some very hysterical moments here that adults will no doubt enjoy . there are some references that only adults will understand , and there is some rude humour that kids will love . the gist of the story is that Garfield has an exact lookalike , who just happens to be a a royal Prince in London . the cat's name is Prince , naturally , anyway , hilarity ensues through mistaken identity . i won't say anymore about the plot . you'll have to watch it too find out the hows and whys . there is also a lesson in this movie about teamwork . the cast is quite a bit larger for this one . there are more animals , and a few more human characters , as well . Bill Murray returns as the voice of Garfield , and Tim Curry voices his British counterpart , with great effect . Breckin Meyer returns as Garfield's owner , John , And Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as his romantic interest . all tolled , this movie beats it's predecessor in all areas . for me , Garfield : a Tale of Two Kitties is a
473608	11423174	427229	7.0	we have lift-off	i must say , this movie is much better than i had anticipated . first off , i am not a fan of Sarah Jessica parker at all . She usually just annoys me . However , she is okay in this movie . She does a good job with her character . Anyway , the basic premise of the story is this : Tripp ( Matthew McConaughey ) is 35 years old and still living at home . His Parents Al ( Terry Bradshaw ) and Sue ( Kathy Bates ) want him to get out on his own and leave the nest . They find a woman named Paula ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) who specializes in getting men who still live at home to move out . they hire her to do just that . Of course things don't quite work out that way . Parker really comes across as sincere and genuine in her role , and even displays some good comic timing , which is a pleasant surprise . McConaughey also handles his role well , in both the dramatic and comedic scenes . the supporting performances ate also strong . Zooey Deschanel ( Almost Famous , Elf ) provides some comic relief as Paula's'bitter , somewhat boozy roommate . Bradley Cooper ( Wedding Crashers , TV series Alias ) , plays one of Tripp's best friend " Demo " while Justin Bartha ( " National Treasure , and its upcoming sequel ) Plays " Ace " another friend . Both also live at home with the parents . Patton Oswalt ( " Blade : Trinity " , " Reno 911 ) plays the role of the techie guy . Tripp's mother Sue ( Bates - " About Schmidt " , " Misery " is wonderful as the mother who is torn about her son leaving . Terry Bradshaw ( former Pittsburgh Steelers star Quarterback ) is brilliant as the Father who can't wait for his son to leave , and has one particularly hilarious moment that must be seen to be believed . and Rob Corddry has an absolutely riotous cameo . i like the original premise behind the movie . however , inevitably the movie follows the formulaic romantic comedy route and does become maudlin at times . the ending , though predictable , is not realistic and is something that would only happen in a movie . However , on the whole , the movie is quite good , due mainly to the performances . i won't say it is excellent but it is as good as most in the genre . and well worth the time and money .
473778	11423174	104609	7.0	better than many straight ti video martial arts flicks ( and even some theatrical releases )	i may be in the minority here , but i actually liked this movie . for a straight to video martial arts movie , it isn't all that bad . trust me , i've seen a lot worse movies of this genre , some of which have ( inexplicably ) had a theatrical release . anyway back to this movie . what did i like about it ? i liked the dynamic of the wise ( cracking ) mentor and the younger , cocky student . Dennis Chan plays the mentor Xian , while Sasha Mitchell plays the young hero . there are some funny lines from both and they both play off each other very well . Mitchell is fairly credible as an action hero . i'm not sure if he has any martial arts experience , but if not , then the fight scenes are very well choreographed . there are some great fights in this movie . Chan is also very good in his role as the sidekick . the fact that the movie had some levity is also a positive . also , unlike in many movies of the genre , where the acting is forced or over the top , that isn't the case here the actors know they're not doing Hamlet . the plot may not be original , but the material is handled as well as any other martial art flick . so , at the risk of being hunted down and shot , i give this movie a ( oh , that's right , i can't be hunted down and shot , because no one knows who i am . ( big raspberry )
472998	11423174	287936	7.0	moves slow , but is worth watching to the end	this little gem is pretty decent made for TV movie . i don't wan to give anything away , but basically there's violent nut bar running around , threatening our main character Susan , played by Nastassja Kinski . if you wanna find out the whos and hows and whys , you have to watch the movie . there a a number of suspects to keep you guessing , although you might figure out who it is fairly quickly . but even if you do , it's still wort the watch . the movie builds atmosphere and suspense very slowly , so if you don't have a lot of patience you might not be able to finish it . however , if you do watch it , i encourage you to watch to the end . i think it's well worth the pay off . for me , Blind Terror is a
472936	11423174	435576	7.0	good show of the supernatural genre	i really wish Point Pleasant had been given more of a chance to find an audience . while i do believe it was a bit slow for the first few episodes , i think it picked up considerably as it went along . and the last four or five episodes especially , i found quite compelling and fraught with tension . the last episode was a real nail biter of a cliffhanger ending ( if that makes any sense , and if the show had picked up from that point , i think it would have found an audience . as it is , it only lasted 13 episodes . one minor annoyance for me , was that i felt the acting was not always as good as i'd hoped , but that too improved as the series went along . all in all , i found it worth watching and would recommend it to others .
473538	11423174	827782	7.0	i didn't like it as much as the first one , but . . .	( this comment refers to the unrated version of the film ) i thought it was still an entertaining movie . there are a few pretty creative kills which are pretty gory . but overall i thought the gore factor was a lot less in this one . so if you're a hard core gore hound , this movie might not satisfy you . i didn't really care for the acting that much , but i've seen worse . i also felt that most of the characters were stereotypical for the genre . and for me , the storyline wasn't very good . it felt too contrived to me . however , i did like the explanation they gave for the root of the evil . i thought it was inventive . there is some nudity in this movie , most of which i felt was not necessary and had nothing to do with the story . it could have been used as filler , to pad the film's short running time . this film also lacked the high tension of the first one . in fact , i didn't really think the film had much atmosphere . the ending to the movie was pretty typical , in my mind . but still , like i said , i felt it was entertaining and had a bit of creativity . this is just my opinion of course , but my vote for Return to House on Haunted Hill is a
473801	11423174	282120	7.0	good animated movie ( but too dark for young kids )	this animated movie from Nickelodeon stars the Thornberry family , who originated from a cartoon series ) in their first movie . i liked this movie . it's got some catchy music and lots of action . it's too dark for little kids due to certain themes . there are some scenes of peril and loss . it's not really a funny movie . it's more of an action adventure . it reminded me a little bit of the Lion King . the movie also deals with some good themes such as family and love . of course things end on a happy note . if you're an adult , there should be enough here to keep you entertained , and older kids will no doubt enjoy it . for me , The Wild Thornberrys movie is a
473787	11423174	98141	7.0	a darker , more realistic version of the Punisher	this version of the Punisher is much different than the 2004 version . for one thing it is much darker , and probably more faithful to the comic book version . the pacing is very deliberate in this one , creating more atmosphere . there are some very good fight scenes in this movie . the biggest difference is the protagonist , which is much more deadly in this one and a worthy adversary for the Punisher . Dolph Lundgren plays the role in this incarnation and is much more imposing , with better physical presence . this is mainly due to his size . he definitely would inspire fear in the criminal element . Lundgren is not really a great actor , but he doesn't need to be for this role . overall , this a good movie , more subdued than the 2004 version . there is more physical action , but very little of things blowing up , which works in this film's favor . a strong
473692	11423174	87469	7.0	much darker than Raiders	i enjoyed this prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark , but not quite as much . it's not as action packed , but there still some impressive action sequences , most of which take place during th last 40 minutes or so . and there are some great death defying moments , as well . there's much more tension throughout than in Raiders . as well there are more comic bits in this one , which is good because the overall tone of the movie is pretty dark , dealing with mysticism and superstition . this installment is a bit slower , but not boring . and i liked the story more . it's a bit more developed . Indy gets too sidekicks in this one , a young Asian boy and a Nightclub singer , which provide much of the comic relief . when you add everything up , it's still a pretty gun time .
472907	11423174	449077	7.0	woman become victim of cyber identity theft and tries to get her life back	The Net 2 . 0 is an above average movie for its genre . It is basically the story of a woman who has her identity along with her life stolen , as if she never existed . she must then try to get it back . this movie is not a sequel to the original . in fact it has none of the characters from that movie . nevertheless , it is suspenseful , riveting and action packed . there are of course a few plot twists , some predictable , others not . the acting is more than decent , especially from Nikki Deloach ( TV's North Shore ) as Hope Cassidy , the main character . She is very credible as a woman who has lost everything . the supporting cast are also strong . the direction is a bit suspect at times , as the director utilizes many jump shots throughout . A jump shot is essentially a type of camera trick . this is used to make the action flashier for the audience . However , it has been done so much before that audiences are mot impressed . minor quibble aside , however , Net 2 . 0 is overall a well done , entertaining and fun movie . well worth your 90 minutes .
473068	11423174	98627	7.0	fairly amusing black comedy which could have been better ( which is where the sequel comes in )	this movie is not too bad . it's a black comedy that is entertaining and certainly amusing . without giving it away , Bernie is a rich guy , who ends up dead , yet still manages to be the life of the party , literally , thanks to two best friends ( Andrew McCarthy , Jonathon Silverman ) who also work or rather - - worked for Bernie . i won't sat any more about the plot . if you want to know more , you'll have to watch the movie to find out . being a black comedy , the movie is entertaining and quite amusing at times , though not drop dead funny . ( sorry , i couldn't resist ) this is of course the point in this type of movie , to be wryly amusing and even ironic at times . i liked it quite a bit , though it could have been better , given the premise . there is so much rich material they could have mined , in my opinion . and while it doesn't quite reach its potential , it's still worth watching . Both McCarthy and Silverman are good in the roles as sort of an " Odd Couple " type . Richard ( Silverman ) is more strait laced and conservative , while Larry ( McCarthy ) is a slacker interested in having fun , more than anything else . Catherine Mary Stewart is very good in her supporting role . i only wish she had a larger role . but it is very clear she is very talented . however it is Terry Kiser as Bernie , who steals the show . who knew a dead guy could be so amusing . all in all , a good , not great movie . it spawned a sequel , which is much better , in my opinion . if you like this movie , i highly recommend part 2 . as for this movie , I'd give it a .
472941	11423174	74285	7.0	nearly perfect movie . . . just one major flaw	i finally got around to watching " Carrie " . while it was worth the wait , i was a little disappointed . the first two thirds of the movie are very well done . it is very easy to sympathize with " Carrie " , given the evil witch ( Piper Laurie in a brilliant performance ) she has for a mother . Carrie ( Sissy Spacek in an equally greet performance ) is an awkward outsider who has been sheltered from life and does not fit in . she is frequently the target of mercilessly cruel verbal abuse and torment from her classmates . but Carrie has a secret . she has the ability to move objects with her mind . this ability could have been explored and developed more in the story . however , now we come to the last act of the film . after a particularly cruel prank ( having a bucket of Pig's blood dumped all over her at the prom ) , Carrie exacts her revenge-sort of . and herein lies the one major problem with film . given her obvious humiliation and anger , you expect the cruel mongers would get their just rewards for what they have done . yet the revenge that Carrie exacts is much less than what these wretches deserve and is anti climatic . her so called mother also deserves a much worse fate than she receives , as well . although the destruction of the house and its being swallowed up by the earth does imply that she gets her just reward in hell . the only problem is that Carrie is with her and hardly deserves the same fate . there is however much more that is positive about this film than negative . the brilliant performances from the two leads , as mentioned , and the very well executed direction , which provides many moments of tension and suspense . the most important aspect of this film , however is the brilliant score by Pino Donagio , which elevates this movie to a whole new level . so , how to rate this film . only one flaw , although a major one . stars seems fair for this movie
472891	11423174	282209	7.0	better than the previous year's similarly themed entry ( )	Darkness Falls follows a somewhat similar plot line as the previous year's entry in the genre , They , with a few differences . One , Darkness Falls has a fairly well fleshed out back story . Two , the acting is generally fairly good . three , the monster has a reason for being , a motivation for its actions . also , the monster has a weakness , which can be exploited . the core storyline is descent for this genre . the movie is better paced and much better edited . the monster itself is however , not so great . the look of the creature isn't the problem . the problem are its movements , which do not look authentic in some scenes . now , the characters themselves - - very little in the form of character development . pretty much your stock horror characters . none too bright and reacting in ways which real people ( hopefully ) would not . yet , strangely likable somehow . you kind of take pity on them . suspense - - there were some tense moments . there was a fair amount of action . however , at times the film became chaotic - - lots of sounds and sights all at once , including the music . the purpose , to pretend to entertain the viewer , well hiding the movie's shortcomings . in essence disguising the fact that the movie isn't achieving its intended purpose . in this case , frightening the viewer or at least heightening his or her anxiety . and now the ending . it does nicely resolve things . no cheap setup for a sequel here . i think it's a better movie than They . is it a good movie ? yes . it has some tense moments with a few decent action sequences and a decent , straightforward ending without the usual unexpected ( but really expected ) ) twist . for me , Darkness Falls is a
473719	11423174	443274	7.0	pretty decent thriller	i thought is movie was pretty decent . in fact , better than i had expected . i don't think i'm giving anything away here by saying that the title refers to a major event that is seen from the point of view of several characters in the film . that's what sets this movie apart from others in the genre of action / thriller / drama . the one complaint i do have is that i felt the acting was mostly a bit flat , especially from Dennis Quaid , and to a lesser extent , Matthew Fox . that's unfortunate , since they are the two main characters . other than that , though , there are some pretty exciting moments , and a twist ending i didn't see coming . for me , Vantage point is a solid
472883	11423174	618184	7.0	part 2 of 2	this second of a two part episode is much better than the first part . for one thing , the story is more fleshed out , which i guess makes sense , since it is the 2nd part . for another , it isn't just the Flash and Green Lantern this time around . some other Justice League members pitch in to lend a hand . unfortunately there is one very importance member missing from this episode . i also wasn't bothered by the voice acting this time around . mostly because there is enough going on to distract from that aspect . this part is not as fast paced as the first one , but i still liked the episode a lot more . it put things into context , so things made more sense . just like in the first part , there is some humour , which i liked . i also really liked the ending . for me , this episode is overall much better and more enjoyable . my vote for Justice League : The brave and the Bold :
473345	11423174	93780	7.0	entertaining action movie	this movie is about a man who ends up being principal of one of the worst schools in the country . the school is pretty much run by a drug lord / gang banger and his cronies . the teachers have given up hope on the kids and stopped teaching them . Rick Latimer ( James Belushi ) is Latimer , who finds himself in over his head , but won't quit . this is more of an action movie than an inspirational one . it's sorta like The Substitute and other similar movies . i don't think there's any real deep message here . and maybe that wasn't the intent of the filmmakers . maybe they just set out to making an entertaining action movie . if so , they succeeded . i found it entertaining . for me , The Principal is a
473181	11423174	67588	7.0	pre - cursor to Fatal attraction	In " play Misty for Me , Clint Eastwood plays Dave , a disc jockey at a local radio station who has a fan . but not just any fan . obsessed female fan named Evelyn ( Jessica Walter ) . Dave and Evelyn have a one night stand . Before Dave knows she is an obsessed fan ) but Evelyn decides that is not enough . she ingratiate herself into Dave's life and decide they are going to be together . except that Dave already has a woman in his life-Tobie ( Donna MIlls ) naturally , Evelyn finds out and being the unbalanced person she is , decides to remedy the situation . you probably have a good idea what happens from here . if you want to know more , watch the movie . this movie is Eastwood's Directorial Debut . it is a psychological horror , suspense film . The movie is dated , being over 25 years old , and many movies have copied the formula since . ( crazed nut bar becomes obsessed with someone ) it is still worth a watch however and is entertaining .
473220	11423174	74475	7.0	well done cautionary tale ( AKCreated to Kill )	i really enjoyed this movie . i thought the acting was very good , and the storyline well developed . i'm sure the movie was inspired by past literary works and movies , but i think it also inspired other movies and novels . so , obviously it's not wholly original , but it does have its own original elements to it . it's a cautionary tale for sure and it's just as relevant today , probably more so . the only negative thing i can say about it is that it can be a bit slow , and the first half has an almost clinical feel to it . by this i mean at times it's a bit dry and almost too scientific . overall , though i think it was a well done movie . i give Embryo a
473489	11423174	119908	7.0	surprisingly good	surprisingly , very surprisingly , i didn't mind this movie at all . it was certainly head and shoulders above number two , and quite a bit better than the first one . this one had a somewhat developed storyline , with pretty decent acting . the villainous is stronger and much more developed in this one . she is certainly more sinister , if that's the right word . but i also noticed some humour in this one , which the first two didn't have , in my recollection . there is of course , no lack of nudity in this one , but i think it served a bit more of a purpose . it still at times seemed like a soft core porn flick , but at least it had other dimensions to it . and as an added bonus , ( especially if you're a guy ) it had Jamie Pressly in a prominent role . anyway , for an entertaining 90 minutes , i think you could do a lot worse than the third installment in the Poison Ivy series . my vote for Poison Ivy : The New Seduction :
472645	11423174	98184	7.0	typical ' serial killer taunts police ' movie , ( with a bit of a twist ) but entertaining with decent performances	this would be your typical ' serial killer taunts police'movie except for one small detail . the audience is let in on the identity of the killer pretty much right off the bat . i think this has been done before , so it's not wholly original , but it's still a bit of a change from most of the genre . the way in which the killer selects his victims might be original , but i'm not completely sure . you might think revealing the killer to the viewer very early on would have a negative impact , but it doesn't seem to . anyway , the remainder of the movie consists of the police trying to find out the killer's identity and stop him . we are given bit of background on why he ends up the way he is and it seems plausible , which is nice for a change . Judd Nelson plays the killer and is credible . there are also touches of humour throughout . the movie moves along at a good clip until the ending . the ending is telegraphed throughout the movie , very deliberately , i think , so it won't come as a very big surprise . anyway , i liked the movie . it's not outstanding but it is entertaining and worth the 90 minutes or so of time .
473742	11423174	96046	7.0	zombie scarecrows terrorize and slaughter small military group in cornfield	This film is a fairly decent suspense / horror flick . it certainly has positive points and some negative . let's start with the positive . first off the premise in inventive , zombie scarecrow in a corn field , killing people ( in this case a small group of soldiers who have stolen over 3 million dollars from their military base and taken refuge in a house surrounded by a cornfield . ) the music was excellent for this film , really upping the ante for eeriness . the prosthetics and makeup effects were surprisingly well done . the death scenes were realistic and there was some gore , but not overdone . the closeup shots of the scarecrows breathing in and out while on their crosses added a bit to the creepiness factor . and i liked the end sequence , again closeup shots of the scarecrows , again ganging on their crosses . now for the negatives . one , the acting wasn't entirely convincing , though I've seen worse . the film was fairly effective for the first 2 acts , but it does descend into camp territory in the last act . this sort of diminishes its effect somewhat . and the other problem with the movie ( and this really bothered me ) was the stupidity of the dog in one of the latter scenes . the girl is flying the plane away , and she gets attacked by a scarecrow and the dog just sit there watching it happen . talk about stupid . anyway , when you add it all up , id have to say the positive aspects slightly outweighed the negatives . the film was entertaining and had some tense moments . as a result , this film gets a
473527	11423174	102555	7.0	not too bad , all things considered	i think this movie was pretty decent . how accurate it is , i have no idea . however , judged strictly on its merits , it's a pretty compelling and engaging movie . i really cared about the characters and the things they had to deal with . it's almost heartbreaking at times , and i did find it hard to watch . but it's also touching . the actors are all very convincing . i thought all their performances were pretty natural . it is also suspenseful and well paced . and you never really know for sure how it will turn out . the movie is " Based on a true story , so i guess if you know the background of the real people involved , you know how it will end . i knew nothing of the story before watching the movie . so i just waited as events unfolded . strictly speaking of the movie as a form of entertainment , i think it does a pretty decent job . i realize that it may be hard for some people to judge this movie as a form of entertainment , and that's certainly understandable and fair . for me though , Not Without my Daughter is about a
472685	11423174	486051	7.0	this one has a few chills	i don't agree with the rating ( ) this movie has on this site . i actually thought it deserved a higher rating . it's a pretty eerie and creepy movie . it has a great atmosphere of dread and foreboding . at least i thought so . i always felt like something creepy was about to happen , which it did . but it usually creeped up slowly on you . there were no jump out of your seat moments . this is an old fashioned type chiller . there's no gore , no trick shots , no sudden loud noise to make you jump . this one keeps the creepy atmosphered right to the end . there is lots of suspense in this movie , and some fine acting from Emily Blunt , and Ashton Holmes , who play the the girl and the boy . we are never told their names . this movie is very deliberately paced , so if you're expecting a lot of action , this is probably the wrong movie for you . for me , though , i enjoyed it . my vote for Wind Chill is a
473623	11423174	843353	7.0	a movie about a serial killer ( i liked it )	i liked this movie . i think Teri Polo is a good dramatic actress , at least judging by this movie . many people probably know her from the comedy " Meet the Parents " and its sequel " Meet the Fockers " . she was good in those movies and she is equally talented in the dramatic arena . i won't say too much about the plot except it involves a serial killer . only 3 people have commented in total so far , and 2 of them clearly did not like it . everybody has their own opinions and ideas on what they consider a good movie . in my mind , this is a good movie . there's mystery , suspense and good acting . as for originality , most movies made today are not completely original so i don't think that should go against this movie . if you are looking to be entertained , this movie might work for you . or not . either way , as i said , liked it . i also have noticed Teri Polo's name in a few other dramatic movies and i think i will try some of them based on her performance in this movie . i think " Legacy of Fear " is a strong
473823	11423174	264761	7.0	well written , with good performances	i found this movie very entertaining it's a very well written , witty romantic comedy , with bit of a twist . the two romantic leads are women . this premise has been done before , with the same supporting character types that usually populate this genre . but the performances are what breath new life into this movie , plus the the characters are all likable , which certainly helps . there are no drop dead funny moments , but there a lot of amusing scenes . the movie is also well paced . however , it's not for everyone . in fact some may find it offensive , due to the subject matter , as well as some strong adult language . but if you go in with an open mind , you should enjoy yourself for 90 minutes or so . for me , Kissing Jessica Stein is a
472794	11423174	80645	7.0	pretty decent , though not really a horror movie , more suspense than anything	i didn't mind this movie . it's no classic or anything but in my opinion , it is worth watching . the acting is surprisingly good for this genre . the killer is pretty wacko . the 2 main cops are kind of humorous at times . this movie did not feel like a horror movie to me . it wasn't really graphic enough for that designation , in my opinion . but it was a good suspense movie . it's a lot better than many movies of the genre and certainly was well worth my time . it won't win any awards for originality ( even for being made in 1980 ) but what horror movie would ? i wouldn't call it a classic , though it may have that designation from some critics and viewers . one thing i will say , and I'm not sure if this is a spoiler but the movie has nothing to do with the title . for me , " Don't Answer the Phone " is a
472915	11423174	486099	7.0	i don't agree with the low rating of	this movie surprised me . i found it better than i expected . i thought it would be pretty lame , instead , its not too bad . i found the story interesting and well paced , for the most part . the acting was adequate for this type of movie . but i didn't like everything about the movie . i found some of the characters , ( mainly the villains ) too stereotypical for my tastes . that annoyed me a bit . that and some of the dialogue was stereotypical and clichéd . as for the creature itself , i thought it looked pretty impressive at times , and fairly unrealistic and cheap at others . one observation i have is that from an Echo Bridge co-production , this movie was more graphic than any of the others i have seen . anyway , i thought there were more positives than negatives , and i was entertained . for me , Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep is a
473882	11423174	427969	7.0	a what if ? movie examining the death of George Reeves ( TV ' Superman of the 50's )	the basic premise of this movie is as as follows . In 1959 , freelance investigator Louis Simo ( Adrien Brody ) investigates the death of Goerge reeves , who played Superman on TV . through flashbacks , we meet Reeves ( Ben Affleck ) years before his Death and before he would play superman . We are also introduced to others who played a role in Reeves life ( and later , possibly his death ) the film is based on actual events , but that is as far as it goes . the filmmakers offer several different possibilities regarding Reeves's Death , but do not favour any one scenario . the ending of the film is ambiguous , letting the viewer form their own opinions . there are some high profile names in this film , including Bob Hoskins and Diane Lane . the very talented Robin Tunney also plays a role in the movie . this movie is not meant to be a conspiracy theory , but more as entertainment , a sort of what if ? . i enjoyed the movie , though it is a bit slow at times . Hollywoodland is rated R for strong language , violence and sexual content .
473762	11423174	93894	7.0	Classic Arnie flick	In the Running Man , Arnold Schwarzenegger play a man framed and wrongly convicted of a crime in the future . His sentence : being a contestant on a brutal reality TV show where the inmates face overwhelming odds to stay alive against their opponents , who are armed and also well protected from head to toe . the game is basically rigged in favour of their opponents . thus far no convict has ever made it out alive . but of course Arnie plays no ordinary inmate . this reality TV show makes what passes for reality TV today look like Mister Rogers . anyway , the film is filled with terrific action sequences , some wit courtesy of some classic Arnie one liners . there are also some suspenseful moments , and some terrific death scenes . the acting may not be stellar , but hey , it's Arnie , so who needs good acting . overall , a very well paced , entertaining piece of work .
472599	11423174	111280	7.0	pretty decent entry	as Star Trek movies go , this is a pretty good one . i'd say it's almost as good as the previous entry The Undiscovered Country . i say almost because there are some moments where i felt it dragged and lost momentum . other than that , though , i didn't really have any issues with it . it thought the story line was quite unique and original . the writing is pretty good , and the action scenes are decent . the acting was also pretty good . the only other thing lacking is a an actual threat of some sort . i mean there is one , but the focus is not really on that . but this movie didn't seem to need that . it works without it . i give Star Trek : Generations a .
473087	11423174	1091617	7.0	Evolution or Intelligent Design	i found this documentary interesting think it is balanced and shows both sides of the issue . Intelligent design proponents as well as evolutionary proponents are interviewed . some of the things they talk about are a bit of a stretch , i think . plus , i wish they had injected a bit of humour and made things a bit lighter to lighten the mood . also the documentary is very sobering , and even sad at times . but no matter what side of the fence you are on , you might find this documentary of interest , maybe even informative , though some of the interviews may have been edited and / or taken out of context , ( like any documentary ) so you really have to be careful . for those of you on the fence about this issue , this documentary could lead you to do your own research and come to your own conclusions . as interesting as this documentary was , i can't use the word entertaining to describe it because it was so serious and dour . nevertheless , it was worth watching . for me , Expelled : NO intelligence Allowed is a
473133	11423174	399327	7.0	who's the man ?	just finished watching " The Man " with Samuel . L Jackson and Eugene Levy . not a bad offering . it's sort of in the vein of " 48 hours " . now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other , though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with " 48 hours . i did however find " the Man " entertaining from beginning to end , from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one . the 2 stars are both very gifted actors , so it was good to see them in action . admittedly , the film was kind of light in tone ( it could have had been a bit more substantial ) and very short in its running time . however , for what it was , it worked very well . i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning . not sure why that would bother me , since i would usually not complain about something like that . ( it'a petty complaint , i'll admit ) maybe i'm becoming someone who gets offended easily . in my ripe old age of 36 . I hope not . anyway , i soon forgot about that and enjoyed the movie . a strong out of 10
473410	11423174	107101	7.0	Chuck Norris in an effective supernatural thriller	this is a good , effective supernatural thriller with some light comedic elements combined . it is quite spooky and eerie . the basic outline is that 2 Chicago cops , Frank Shatter ( Norris ) and his partner Calvin Levels ( Calvin Jackson ) end up in Jerusalem ( you'll have to watch the movie ) as past of a routine murder investigation that is anything but routine . in fact , the fate of the world may depend on them . Norris and Jackson have good chemistry as the 2 partners and work well off each other . the partners have differing opinions on just about everything , which provides some amusing moments . i like the idea of Chuck going up against someone who may not be easy to defeat . i thought the movie was very entertaining and Chuck was convincing in his role as was Jackson . Sheree J . Wilson also plays a pivotal role in the film . Christopher Neame puts in an outstanding performance as the villain . Overall , a better than average movie . worth watching . a strong
472576	11423174	87233	7.0	not your typical love story ,	and i mean that in a good way . for one thing , the story isn't contrived like so many others of the genre . also it's not overly sentimental or sappy . you really believe these two people could fall in love . also the way they fell in love was realistic . Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep really do come across as genuine , playing two lonely people who meet through fate . but there's only one small hitch : they're both married . the movie is not fast paced , so if that's what you're expecting , you'll be disappointed . instead , it's an honest , unconventional love story that takes some time for the relationship to develop between the two central characters . Dianne Wiest has a small role , and is almost unrecognizable . it's nice to see Harvey Kietel in an everyman kind of role , as well as Jane Kaczmarek ( Malcolm in the Middle ) . but it's really Streep and DE Niro who make the movie what it is . if their portrayals were not authentic or honest , the film would not work . for me , Falling in Love is a
473141	11423174	452623	7.0	good movie , but not as good as the trailer made it out to be	i initially had no interest in seeing this movie . then , one day , i happened to catch a trailer for it . the trailer made the movie look fantastic , so my friend and i watched it on pay per view . i have to say , i'm disappointed . don't get me wrong , this is still a good movie , but i don't feel it's the masterpiece it was mad out to be . for one thing , i found it too formulaic and predictable . there is of course a moral dilemma for one of our characters . stylistically , it reminded me of both The Departed and Mystic River , which isn't a bad thing in this case . it's just an observation . the acting is very good , in this movie , Casey Affleck holds his own against Morgan Freeman , who is brilliant as usual , though his role is not that big . for me , Gone Baby Gone is a
472662	11423174	117765	7.0	a skillful blend of comedy / drama / politics / thriller / crime drama ( and Burt Reynolds in a brilliant comic turn )	the movie Striptease is a combination crime drama / comedy / thriller . with a bit of political humour thrown in . it manages to balance all of these elements well , and as a result is very entertaining . Demi Moore gets top billing here and is very convincing as Erin Grant a woman who loses custody of her daughter to her small time thug husband ( played with great relish by Robert Patrick ) . In order to obtain the money to appeal the verdict she resorts to being an exotic dancer at a strip club . There are a few well known names in this movie , but It is Burt Reynolds who steals the show . Reynolds Plays Congressman David Dilbeck , who happens to be in the audience ( incognito , of course ) and falls head over heals in love ? with Erin . Congressman Dilbeck also happens to be a full time horn dog , so comedy ensues . But there is one scene in particular where Dilbeck is scheduled to appear before a youth Christian conference and is late . the reason he is late is absolutely hysterical . I won't give any more away , except to say watch this movie . You will enjoy it . out of 10
472811	11423174	122151	7.0	Mel Gibson , Danny GloverJoe Pesci , Rene Russo , Chris Rock , and Jet Li	out of all four movies in the series , this is probably the loudest and most chaotic , but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie . i think the storyline was a bit thin and not really all that original , but just like in part three , the action , and the chemistry of the stars makes up for that . and this movie also has more laughs than the previous installments , many courtesy of both Joe Pesci and Chris Rock . Rene Russo is back , along with Mel and Danny . Jet Li joins the proceedings in this one , and brings some spectacular fight scenes courtesy of his martial arts skill . i don't know if this is the best of the series , but i thought it was as good as number three , which i really liked . for me , Lethal Weapon 4 is a
472760	11423174	441773	7.0	entertaining ( )	well , i liked the movie . the story was interesting , and the action scenes were good . the voice acting fit well with the characters . i gotta say though , that , i never laughed once . maybe it's just me , or maybe you have to be in a certain mood . still , i thought it was a good movie . it moves along at a good pace , and it's certainly never boring . it reminded me of the movie Beverly Hills Ninja , starring Chris Farley from 1997 . the main character is pretty much the same type of character , except in that one , our hero is a human being , and in this one , of course , he's a panda . the other difference is i actually found Beverly Hills Ninja pretty funny . but that's neither here nor there . as for Kung Fu Panda , i was entertained throughout . i just didn't laugh . for me Kung Fu Panda is a
473550	11423174	934706	7.0	not too bad , but not that faithful to the comic version of events	as an animated movie , this one isn't too bad . i liked the story and the great action sequences and there are some great fight scenes . but if you're really into the history behind the battle between Superman and Doomsday and the aftermath ( in other words , if you've read the comic version of the events ) you might be disappointed , as i don't think it is that faithful to the source material . but beyond that , the movie does seem a little rushed . i think they may have tried to jam too much into the short 75 minute running time . still , the movie is entertaining . you shouldn't get bored watching it . DC has done better though and although i liked it , it wasn't as good as i had hoped or expected . all in all , though , i'd Give Superman : Doomsday a based on it's entertainment value .
472833	11423174	397065	7.0	fun horror film	many people really slagged this movie and Paris Hilton . i'm not sure why . Yes , it's a horror movie-and yes it's a remake of a 1953 movie with Vincent Price . so it can not be called original . but then again , how many people in the target audience have seen the original , or even know about it . so throw that argument out the window . As for Paris Hilton , she is not that bad of an actress . anyway , as for the movie itself , it's a fun thrill ride with a fair amount of suspense . the acting is as good as any for this genre , and it seemed as if the actors were really having fun with it . my advice pop the movie in , shut off your brain for the duration and enjoy . there are a lot worse movies out there . ( in this genre and others )
473485	11423174	299988	7.0	decent sequel , not quite up to the standard of the first one	the main problem i found with this movie is it is not original , whereas the first one was . there is lots of action and some excitement and a pretty high body count , but there is very little in the way of gore . in my mind , most of the kills were lame . i like the fact that the heroine is a woman , and she a pretty strong character . the movie felt much liter in tone the the first one . it was sort of missing that scenes of foreboding . also , there are not any real scenes of peril or suspense . i do think the movie was entertaining , and the villain was not a bad character , although it would be hard to beat Rutger Hauer " s portrayal of the psycho in the fist movie . when all is said and done , i'd have to give " The Hitcher 2 "
473744	11423174	115798	7.0	and you thought you had problems	This is the second feature film directed by Ben Stiller , the first being " Reality Bites " which i have not seen . anyway the this movie is basically about the cable guy from hell . Steven Kovacs ( Matthew Brodderick ) has just been kicked out of his girlfriend's place . he now has his own apartment and is waiting for the cable guy to show up . The cable guy ( Jim Carrey ) shows up and installs the cable even giving Steven all the movie channels for free . From then on , the cable guy ingratiates himself into Stevens life , thinking they are best pals . one he realizes Steven doesn't feel the the seam way , things take dark turn . Jim Carrey is very good as the cable guy , showing his dark side , as well as the usual Jim Carrey manic hi-jinx . Matthew Brodderick is good in his role , although he is given little to do except react to Carey . This is a dark turn for Carey , a sort of dark comedy . but it works well , showing Carey has some range . Ben stiller does a good job directing this one , as it must have been a challenge reigning Carrey in for more serious scenes . i have to mention there is on hysterical scene , involving a particular word game .
473398	11423174	120179	7.0	not as good as the first one , but still fairly entertaining	while i don't think this movie was a s good as the original , i also don't think it's as bad as the rating here ( ) indicates . true , it doesn't have Keanu Reeves , or Dennis Hopper as the bad guy . however , Sandra Bullock does return . and it does have Jason Patric , who's pretty good actor with some charisma . and let's not forget Willem Dafoe as the bad guy . he's makes a good villain , in my mind . just like the first " Speed " this one has some decent action sequences , but they are less frequent ans less flashy than the original . also , there is one scenes which completely shatters believability . the story itself is not as compelling . in fact , i think there is less depth to this one . Jan de Bont and Graham Yost are also behind this one , but for whatever reason they fail to capture the same magic . still , it's a highly entertaining movie . for that reason , i give " Speed 2 "
472647	11423174	393162	7.0	the movie is inspirational without being preachy and Samuel L . Jackson puts on an acting clinic	there are many ' based on true events , underdog stories ' made into movies . but this one is different . yes , it is inspirational , but it isn't preachy and schmaltzy like so many have been . maybe the studios are finally seeing the light . after all , this is the second recent movie of the genre ( that i have seen ) to get it right , the other being " Glory Road " . as for " Coach Carter " , it's a pretty subdued affair . it focuses on a High School basketball coach ( Samuel . L . Jackson ) who has a vision for the students at his school . not only will they become winners on the basketball court , but they will also be inners off . this means as human beings , they will lose he loser , mediocrity mentality which has been ingrained intro them , by the school system and even their parents . of course , he meets fierce opposition . does he succeed in this vision ? well , lets just say things don't go quite the way you might expect them to . this movie is very character and story driven , so don't expect a lot of action . there aren't that many basketball sequences . much of the movie takes place off the court . but the movie works for 3 reasons . first , its ability to tell an inspirational story without bringing out the sledgehammer . second , the the supporting performances are all credible . but more important is the masterful acting of Samuel L . Jackson . the man is simply mesmerizing . you believe every second of his performance . the man has great screen presence and charisma and the emotion he conveys is real . the movie is long , but it's all about getting there , not being there , and the journey is worth it , in my opinion .
473326	11423174	74751	7.0	less faithful to the original , but more entertaining than the recently released version	this version of " King Kong " was very unfairly ravaged by critics when it premiered in 1976 . i have no idea why . yes it had some problems , and it also had some strong points . first , the problems . the ape walked upright instead of on its knuckles ( this was less of a problem with me than with most of the critics ) . purists were very upset with this . next , a glaring problem . in many scenes , you can clearly see that miniature models of certain structure were used . this is so obvious it is laughable . also . i think i'm the filmmakers veered away somewhat from the original version leaving out some pivotal scenes . the strong points : good performances from all the main characters . the ape looked fairly realistic for the its time . the movie was well paced . there were no humorous bits , no filler . it was not a grand spectacle , like the recently release version . the scenes between the ape and the woman were more heartfelt . i found it more entertaining than the latest version , much more exciting . i give this film
473132	11423174	454919	7.0	solid thriller	Pulse is a thriller along the guidelines of " White Noise " which starred Michael Keaton . i did enjoy White Noise , but I thought Pulse was a bit better at the thrilling aspects . Basically , the premise of Pulse is that dead spirits have found a way to break through the barrier between their world and ours and have taken over all our communication networks ans begun taking over people's bodies and infecting them with a deadly virus in order to eliminate the human race and take control . Kristen Bell , of Veronica Mars fame , plays the heroin in the movie and does a very convincing job in the role . i should mention that White Noise is much narrower in its scope . it does deal with spirits , but there no is subplot involving spirits taking over the world . Anyway , i hope i haven't said too much . both movies are great . it just depends on your taste . White Noise is more suspenseful and Pulse is more of a thriller , though each contains both elements . anyway pulse gets a strong out of 10
472748	11423174	406759	7.0	freaky	this film is a remake of an Asian film , which seems to be all the rage these days , and has been for quite some time . who knows how long this trend will last . anyway , i haven't seen the original , so i can't compare the two . as for this remake , i liked it for the most part . it has some pretty freaky moments alright . it's not really scary Per Se , but it is definitely unsettling . Jessica Alba is not too bad in this movie . in fact she does a better job than i thought she would . aside from being a remake , the premise of this movie has been done before in probably two movies , the names of which escape me . there are a few slow moments in the movie . but mostly it's good . i really liked the ending . i though it elevated the movie a bit . i wasn't expecting it to end the way it did . for me , The Eye is i a
473137	11423174	380066	7.0	a solid entry in the horror genre	The Woods is a solid , eerily effective ghost story , it boasts very good acting , a decent plot and a good setting . there are some special effects , but not as much as you would expect , which is a refreshing change for this genre . this is not a slasher flick . the movie is very character driven , and so is very dramatic , and is a bit slow at times , but not enough to lose interest . the only weak spot is near the end of the movie , but i won't give it away . the movie relies more on suspense and psychological scares than gore , another positive . this is not the best movie of the genre , but it is certainly on of the better . for those who like a little gore in their movies , it may not be your cup of tea . but then again , this is a different type of movie which doesn't require gore to tell its story . all in all a good offering . A strong out of 10
473557	11423174	432021	7.0	better than the first two by leaps and bounds	i thought this was the best of the Resident Evil franchise . the action was more intense , the fight scenes were away more spectacular and i also really liked the music . obviously , it's not original , bearing many similarities to the first two . and it does borrow heavily from other movies . but still , it is an entertaining romp . i think it is much more gory and graphic than the first two . this is just an observation . it didn't really bother me . this is the first resident Evil movie i have seen on the big screen , and if you have a chance to watch it in the theatre , i think it's worth it . it won't win any awards for deep characterizations or storyline , but it really isn't that kind of movie . it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else . i think it does what it sets out to do , and that is to entertain . for me , Resident Evil : Extinction is a definite
472812	11423174	104714	7.0	Mel Gibson , Danny Glover , Joe Pesci , and Rene Russo	Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back in action again , as Riggs and Murtaugh , two L . A . cops who were first introduced in the first Lethal Weapon movie . Joe Pesci returns as smart alec Leo Getz , though his role is smaller in this movie . However Rene Russo joins the gang this time around . as for the movie itself , i liked it as much as the second one . there's an exciting chase scene , some great fight scenes , and the movie is funnier than the first two . Not only do Gibson and Glover have their back and forth banter , but so do Gibson and Russo . they have great chemistry together and really work well of each other . the only thing i didn't like that much about this installment was that the story was pretty standard for the genre , and the bad guys were your typical generic , run of the mill crooks . but the performances , the comedy and the chemistry of the actors make up for that . for me , Lethal Weapon 3 is a
473571	11423174	369281	7.0	pretty decent all around ( 3D animation is pretty good ) but could have been better	i guess i didn't mind this movie . i mean , it is enjoyable and the animation is well done . the story is simple , yet muddled at times , if that makes any sense . there are a lot of different characters in this one , and it's kind of hard to keep track , at times . there is lots of action and adventure . i found the ending anti-climatic . this is the first of three movies in the " Bionicle series " , and though i haven't seen the 2nd and 3rd yet , i suspect this one is a stand alone adventure . anyway , it's an entertaining 3D animated movie , though i wouldn't call it stellar , by any means . it's pretty fast paced , but short in its running time ( less than 80 minutes . nevertheless , i think there are many more positives than negatives . i'm giving " Bionicle : Mask of light " a
472990	11423174	1034331	7.0	Pacino and De Niro star together	finally , we get a movie starring both Robert Di Nero and all Pacino actually sharing scenes together . they were both in Micheal Mann's 1995 heist caper heat , but shared almost no screen time together . in righteous kill , they play cops and longtime partners , trying to put the bad guys away and off the street . naturally things don't always work out that way , and there's more to it than that . if you're expecting an action movie here , you won't get it . it's more of a procedural crime drama . it's not fast paced , but it isn't boring . i found it interesting . there's a nice little twist that i didn't see coming . Jon Avnet directed this movie . he also directed 2007's 88 minutes , which also starred All Pacino . i linseed this movie better than that one . this one has more going on , more depth to the story . Carla Gugino , who like a lot stars , as well as Donnie Wahlberg , . and also Curtis " 50 cent " Jackson , who does a fine job here . the underrated Brian Dennehy also stars . for me , Righteous Kill is a
473652	11423174	420324	7.0	Superman and Batman form an uneasy alliance	this short film trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance . obviously , the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment . it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along . i won't go int to the storyline here . but i will get into the acting , which is terrific . everyone is well cast . the two actors playing Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters . the same filmmakers that made Batman : Dead End and Grayson also made this short film . of the three , i probably liked this one the least , but i still thought it was well done . for me , World's finest is a
473685	11423174	424136	7.0	a real treat ( i've never seen anything like it )	a 14 year old girl has a three week chat-room relationship with a man . they decide to meet in person . it turns out he may be not be what he seems . but then neither is she . i won't give any of the plot away . you will have to watch the movie to find out more . i will say this film is along the lines of Fatal Attraction and others of the genre , except it turns the conventions of the genre upside down and inside out . it's exceptionally creative and inventive . i haven't seen anything like it before . i was also really impressed with both the acting and writing , as well as the dialogue . this is one compelling little thriller , although thriller might not quite be the correct word . it is certainly harrowing though . definitely one of the more interesting movies i have seen in a while . for me , Hard Candy is a
473712	11423174	113409	7.0	an entertaining yet strange , twisted horror / sci-fi hybrid	in the mouth of madness is one bizarre movie . it is part horror , part science fiction , with shades of many movies past thrown into the mix . i enjoyed the movie , yet i can't think of any particular reason . it certainly wasn't scary and there is very little in the way of suspense . however , the creepiness factor is quite high , as is the disgust factor at times . the makeup effects at times were not impressive , in fact at times seemed downright amateurish . the ending is of course ambiguous , as is the entire movie . the premise was interesting . an insurance investigator is pulled into a popular horror writers fictional world . he eventually discovers he is a character in one of the writer's horror novels and that all of his actions have been dictated by what is written in the book . sam neil plays the insurance investigator , john trent and does a good job of showing the gradual progression of trent from a rational , logical man to one who may or not ne be sane , as he discovers what he thinks is reality may not be . of course we never really know ourselves whether trent is crazy or whether he really is just a figment of an author's imagination . the truth of the matter is really left to us to decide . this is one of those rare instances where an open ending actually works . the movie itself is effective because we are left to our imagination and can create our own ending . out of 10
473660	11423174	418141	7.0	the best Scooby Doo adventure yet	good job . that's how i would describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure . this is so far the best of the animated Scooby movies i have seen . i liked the story . i thought it had some depth to to it . the movie is also well paced . it doesn't get boring for a minute . it also has an interesting group of characters ( besides Scooby and Shaggy and the gang , of course ) plus , the movie was a real blast . i has a lot of fun watching it . i also liked the great Scottish music . it was very catchy and infectious . naturally , we know that Scooby and the Gamg will solve the mystery , but it's still fun getting to that point . the animation is also pretty good for this movie . i would love it if they did a 3D animation Scooby adventure , but we'll just have to wait and see . for me , Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness monster is a
472712	11423174	161970	7.0	action , excitement , danger and intrigue	i don't get the low rating this movie has here ( ) . i think this movie is pretty good . there's action , excitement , danger and intrigue . the acting is also pretty good . i really enjoyed Ernie Hudson's character and his performance . the shark attacks are pretty thrilling , at least i think so . i also like the music , which really heightens the suspense . the story is also good , in my opinion . the movie moves at a good pace and the sharks definitely inspire fear . i think you could do a lot worse than spending 90 minutes watching this movie . for , me it's an enjoyable ride . i think this movie is being unfairly criticized and is nowhere near as bad as its rating indicates . i give " Shark Attack " a
473616	11423174	458352	7.0	a scathing indictment of the world of fashion ( true or not-but probably true )	this movie is billed as being a comedy drama , but it is more of a black comedy than straight comedy . the movie is very sarcastic and ironic in its portrayal of the fashion industry in general , and the head of a major fashion magazine in particular . Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestly the head of the major fashion magazine Runway . Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs , an eager young woman who dreams of becoming a top journalist and thinks that working as assistant to Miranda Priestly for one year will be her ticket into real journalism . Stanley Tucci plays Nigel a lifer at the company ( really nothing more than a glorified worker bee , who thinks much higher of himself ) who hopes to one day leave the company and have a venture of his own . Streep Plays Priestly as a scathing , ruthless , ice queen , concerned about nothing and no one but herself and the magazine . she has little time for the peons under her ( who of course do all the work and get no credit ) . she is virtually void of emotion or human feeling of any kind . though there are a few scenes witch show there might be a human being under there . she is also shown , in a few scenes as being vulnerable and insecure , as she has a husband who treats her as she treats those around her . Hathaway's Sachs is a fashion neophyte , as naive as she is eager . time goes on and things change , of course . in time Sachs learns valuable life lessons , naturally . the movie at times is sappy and maudlin and the character of Sachs is played a bit to unreal in the latter stages of the movie . the movie filled with witty , sharp dialogue that flows very smoothly . Streep ' performance is subtle and understated but bang on for her character . Tucchi's Nigel provides some dry comic relief and glimpses of humanity . Hathaway fails to make a big impact , and is really just fodder in much of the movie . the character of Miranda Priestly is purportedly based on a real person , although no one can say that of course . either way it offers a scathing indictment of the fashion industry , especially the elite . these people deserve to be skewered , and if they can't take it , they are as thin skinned as those people that work beneath them and are also accused of being thin skinned . How ironic . i hope people in the industry watch this movie and feel uncomfortable , as they should . this movie rates a solid
473304	11423174	373883	7.0	i liked it a bit more than the original version	prior to watching this movie , i'd heard people say that director Rob Zombie had butchered the franchise with his take on the Halloween lore . i don't share that viewpoint . i though the movie had a lot of good points to it . i thought the casting of Malcom McDowell was genius . he plays his character tongue in cheek , and really i think that's the whole tone of the movie . and it worked for me . there are some serious parts and the movie even has a moral , but it doesn't hit you over the head with anything . the violence is more sudden and a bit more graphic than the 1978 version . the acting is better in this movie , i think . the actor who played the grown up Micheal Myers ( the psycho ) is very convincing . and the child who played young Michael Myers is perfect for the role . the movie does tend to be slow in spots , but i still think it is a better movie than the original version . there is a lot of crude language in the movie and a fair amount of nudity , so be warned . for me , Halloween ( 2007 ) is a
473739	11423174	113855	7.0	a fun martial arts action flick	Mortal kombat is a fun movie , although dated . there is plenty of action , good fight choreography and the story is unique for its time . the characters are all interesting and the good guys are likable . the one complaint about this movie is that its makeup effects are poorly done In regards to one of the main baddies , a freak of nature named goro . it looks very much like goro is simply a man in a rubber suit , which does not look at all real . the movie is over ten years old , but still , you'd think they could have done a better job . however , surprisingly , this does not take away from the rest of the film . it is a fun diversion for around 90 minutes , and it moves at a good clip . i also like the fact that there is some character development , showing the motivation of the characters . to me , this is an enjoyable film , despite its flaws . out of 10
472682	11423174	441007	7.0	i thought it was entertaining	i enjoyed this movie . i thought it was pretty good from an entertainment point of view . however , i didn't fee it was very inspirational and for me , it didn't have the impact that many of the movies of the genre have . i didn't find anything profound about it . i think it may be loosely inspired by real events , which could mean anything as far as movies go . i could not really get into it beyond a superficial level . i'm not sure why . maybe it's because i'm not a real soccer fan . having said that , it was well acted , and well paced . it certainly wasn't boring , by any means . the songs they chose for the movie were also really good . i would probably watch this movie again down the road , though , because as i said , it's enjoyable as entertainment . for me , Gracie is a
473015	11423174	14142	7.0	lust , betrayal and deception	this is the second filmed version of Victor Hugo's classic novel , the first one being The Darling of Paris in 1917 . in this version , Lon Chaney plays the title character whose name is Quasi Modo and judging by how the character looks , Chaney endured quite a bit for the character . Quasi Modo is a deformed slave and bell ringer . this movie isn't as much about the hunchback as it is about one woman who has stolen the hearts of a few men , and what they do to try and win her love . what follows is lust , deception betray and tragedy . caught up in the middle of it all , through no fault of his own , is Quasi Modo . but the movie isn't all sadness and despair . at the beginning , it is lite hearted and comical . i enjoyed most of the film , though it does have its slow moments . the acting is quite good though , as is the musical accompaniment . i give The Hunchback of Notre Dame
472830	11423174	74812	7.0	slightly dated ( yet relevant ) futuristic tale of Utopia ( or is it Dystopia ? )	this is a hard movie to rate . It was made in 1976 , so is dated in some ways by today's standards . the special effects , while innovative at the time , are almost laughable today . the story though is relevant in today's age , even more so than 1976 . it brings up moral and ethical dilemmas as we may be closer to the events in the movie than ever , though admittedly , still a long way off . the basic premise is that everyone lives inside a walled city , free to do whatever they want , until , that is their 30th birthday . at this time , they must go through a process called " renewal " , where they start over again . However , there are those , who wish to live beyond 30 and attempt to escape . these people are called " runners " . an elite police force , known as the Sandmen , must find them and terminate them . this is the sole purpose of each Sandman . As i mentioned earlier , there are many moral and ethical dilemmas brought up by this movie , especially given Earth's History , its present , and most certainly its future . the movie is not heavy handed , or preachy , however . you will have to watch the movie to find out more . If you are an action junkie , this movie may not be your cup of tea . while there is some action , it is not the bombastic , frenetic type of action found in many of today's movies . the movie is also more dialogue driven and is fairly slow at times . however , it does pick up and is worth watching , especially if you like movies which cause you to think .
472711	11423174	222355	7.0	intense and thrilling	this movie could be called a blatant rip-off of " Jaws 3 " , at least the beginning of it . however it has an added twist and it's a much better movie . the shark attacks are really bloody and violent in this one , and the are frenetic at times . i'm not sure if this movie is better than the first , but it's still pretty good . again there's lots of action , and the sharks are fear inspiring . the acting is pretty good . the movie is a bit too melodramatic at times and lags once in awhile . even so , it's an entertaining movie with some thrills and some nail biting tension . there are a lot worse movies out there in the genre and in general . if you wanna fill 90 minutes or so , you could do a lot worse , and you may even enjoy it . my vote for " Shark Attack 2 " is
473630	11423174	452598	7.0	i found it higher energy and more entertaining than the 1st one	i actually think this is a better movie than the 1st one . i don't think it has as many funny moments , but there are some . i just think it is more entertaining and has an even higher energy level . i also liked the story more . it has a bit more to it . Eugene levy is in this one , and i think he really adds something to the movie . the rivalry between his and Steve Martin's character is quite fun to watch . The original cast are all back , and the acting is once again good . this time around Steve Martin did not over exaggerate his facial expressions and movements during the physical comedy moments . if he did , i didn't notice . at the end of the movie , i wondered if they would make a third entry in the series , which i really hope they do . anyway , for me " Cheaper by the Dozen 2 " is a strong
473900	11423174	1097636	7.0	lots of fast paced fun	this is a pretty good Scooby Doo movie . it's fast paced , with some interesting characters , and the story is interesting . beyond that , the movie is fun to watch . Scooby and the gang are supposed to be vacationing in Paris , but end up in Nepal , battling the abominable snowman , and trying to unravel the mystery as they go . this Scooby Doo movie has a lot more action than many i've seen so far , and it's also quite funny . fans of Scooby and the gang are sure to like it , and even people who have never seen a Scooby Doo adventure should find it entertaining . if you haven't seen it you should check it out . for me , Chill Out Scooby Doo is a
472882	11423174	117624	7.0	Locklear is very convincing	Shattered Mind , AKA The terror Inside stars Heather Locklear as a woman tormented by multiple personalities . Locklear is very convincing here , in a very non glamorous role . the movie is engrossing at times , but very dreary and depressing . it's also hard to follow at times and , moves ponderously slow . it's hard to watch , to say the least . i don't think it's a movie you could enjoy , but i think it's enlightening . the performances are all good . the problem is , the story is almost all hopeless despair , with no real bright side . i think it would have been better if there had been a few lighter moments , though i realize it's not always easy to do with this type of movie . it's a made for TV movie , but it's very well made . because of that and the performances , especially Locklear , i give Shattered Mind a
472580	11423174	117626	7.0	pretty decent made for TV movie	" She Cried No " AKA " Freshman Fall , is a pretty good TV movie , but it is pretty generic for the genre . it doesn't stand out or anything , but it is well made . the acting performances are pretty good and the characters are pretty believable . the one thing that does set this movie apart would be the ending , which is unexpected and unconventional for this type of movie , at least in my experience . it's nice to see a movie that doesn't cop out in the end . it's also nice to see a strong female character . the movie is certainly watchable and well paced , though there isn't really a lot of tension . still , it's a decent way to spend 90 minutes . i give " She Cried No " a
472983	11423174	401997	7.0	solid espionage movie	i thought this was a well done movie . it moves along at a good clip . it's never boring , and it was much more straight forward than i expected it to be , making it easy to follow . this is a movie that i didn't find overly compelling , but more than enough to maintain interest . there isn't a lot of suspense or tension . we are shown at the beginning how the movie will end up , but it is interesting seeing how it gets to that that point . that's a credit to the good writing . but i think it the acting in this one that really elevates it . Chris Cooper was terrific as usual . but Ryan Phillippe really impressed me here . i thought he was outstanding . Laura Linney was good as well , although i wish she had been given a more substantial role . all things considered , this is a low key movie . it won't blow you socks off or anything , but it works . i would watch this movie again , as i found it interesting . for me , Breach is a solid
473462	11423174	366174	7.0	fun and thrilling ( but as deep as a puddle )	Anacondas is the second of the anaconda films , but is not a sequel to the original . it is a stand alone film , and a fairly decent effort . there are no cast members from the original film . the film take s a more serious tone than its predecessor with no campy elements . The action scenes are much more plentiful and intense . and instead of just one anaconda , there are several , hence the title . there is an ensemble cast , which are all competent , given the material . there an eclectic character mix here ranging from the likable to the not so likable and the completely hate inspiring . the motivations of the characters are well fleshed out , always a good thing . the film itself delves into the territory of implausibility at times , but there would be no movie otherwise . Entertaining , fast paced with some thrilling sequences , combine to make Anacondas a worthwhile experience . just don't expect anything deep .
472673	11423174	79227	7.0	one of Chuck Norris's earlier films heavier on the story , lighter on the fighting	this is one of Chuck Norris's earlier films . this movie i ( belive it or not ) more story driven , rather than focusing on martial arts action . Chuck Plays John T . Booker , an ex commando who suddenly finds that members of his former unit are being assassinated . Booker tries to warn those that are still alive and find out why they are being targeted . He believes he is also on the list , so his time is limited to find both the killer and the reason for the murders . Chuck actually uses his acting chops more than his fists and feet in this outing . he actually does an okay job in that dept . there are still some fight scenes in the movie , which actually look more realistic than in today's martial arts flicks . there are no flashy camera tricks here . back in the 70's people liked their action more authentic . i liked that about his film . if you are looking for an all out action movie , this 1 is not for you . however , if you like a little story in the mix , check it out .
473591	11423174	100157	7.0	one of the better Stephen King novels adapted for the screen	this is one of the best Stephen King novels adapted for the big screen . this movie is well acted , well written and well directed . Kathy bates makes a great homicidal maniac . James Caan plays novelist Paul Sheldon who ends up being tormented by Annie Wilkes , who is his biggest fan . she goes to great lengths to prove just how big a fan she is . of course , she is also very angry at Sheldon , so of course he must be punished . i won't reveal how he comes to be tormented by her , or why she is angry at him , but she has her reasons , sick and twisted they may be . Caan is also convincing as a man who believes his life is in danger and is desperate to survive . anyway , the suspense factor is high in this one , as is the creepiness factor . for me , Misery is a
473785	11423174	84602	7.0	2nd sequel in Rocky series	Rocky 3 is not a bad movie , as far as the series goes . it has lots of action , some good training sequences and some dramatic moments . however it lacks something that the first 2 have . and that is heart . it just doesn't have the depth of that they have . this is not a tangible thing , but more a feeling . if you watch Rocky 3 , you will understand . the antagonist , ( villain ) Clubber Lang , Rocky's rival , is fairly strong as portrayed by Mr . T . though i get the sense this movie was made just to keep the franchise going . I say this because if you watch the next installment , Rocky 4 , you will notice there is more intent to the whole movie . The antagonist is much more developed and there is more at stake . there are actually 2 antagonists and you will understand if you watch the movie . anyway , back to 3 . the filmmakers could have done without this installment and went right to 4 . as for Rocky 3 - - 7 stars / 10
473606	11423174	216620	7.0	decent suspense movie , but a bit slow a times	this is a pretty good movie , all things considered . it has its moments of suspense and tension , and there are a few possible suspects for the psycho , at least in the first half or so . the acting is fairly decent , and the writing is fair . i will say that i found that sometimes the build up to some scenes is a bit too drawn out . and the ending is a bit too ambiguous for me . however , having Jerry Wasserman as the creepy town sheriff is a stroke of casting genius . you never really know what's going on in his mind , and whether he's a good guy or a bad guy , at least until near the end of the movie . he steals every scene he's in . John Savage is also good as the creepy father . when you add everything up , this movie is certainly watchable and more than that at times . for me , " Christina's House " is a
473167	11423174	164184	7.0	fourth movie in the Jack Ryan Series ( second best next to The Hunt for red October )	this fourth movie in the Jack Ryan series , features Ben Affexk as Ryan , who surprisingly does an OK job . but there are two supporting performances that really stand out for me , first is Morgan Freeman , who is amazing in his role . and Liev Schreiber , . both are equally effective . for me , the movie is almost worth it just because of those two performances . the rest of the supporting cast is also very good . i like the story . i found it very relevant and realistic . i also thought way the characters behave in the movie is realistic , as well . the special effects in this movie blew me out of my seat . they were seamless , as far as i can tell . there's also the unpredictable aspect of the movie . and there is a lot of suspense and tension to keep you riveted . by the way , the first movie of the Jack Ryan series is The Hunt for red October with Alec Baldwin as Ryan . the second one is patriot Games , with Harrison Ford as the title character . the third is Clear and Present Danger , also with Ford . but for me , The Sum of all Fears is the second best of the series , next to The Hunt for Red October . the other two , i didn't really care for too much . for me , The Sum of all Fears is a
473793	11423174	107889	7.0	i didn't like it as much as Friday Night Lights . . . , but	i still liked it . i just felt that . . . Nights had a stronger story , and i was more emotionally involved . i also found the characters mote compelling . for me the program dragged at times , when there were scenes not involving football . fortunately these scenes weren't very long , and there weren't a lot of them . of all the actors in the movie , i was most impressed with Kristy Swanson and Halle Berry , though bad had fairly small roles . the program was entertaining enough to keep watching , i just didn't think it was spectacular . is it worth buying ? hard to say . but i do think it's certainly worth catching on premium cable or as rental . these are just my thoughts . my vote for the program :
473269	11423174	339135	7.0	Van Damme shows some acting ability in this one	as far as i know , this movie represents a big departure for Jean Claude Van Damme . to me , it marks the first time he has put in a good acting performance . this movie is more of a drama than anything . there are some fight scenes , but they are much more realistic and gritty than his past films , at the one i have seen . the movie also contains some very brutal moments , some implied , others shown . Van Damme's character is shown as very human in this movie . there was also a point to the film , something sorely lacking in previous efforts . it was entertaining , but also very hard to watch at times . if you are expecting over the top fights and stunts , you won't find it here . instead you will find what seems to me to be a fairly accurate portrayal of life in prison , and the horrors that occur there . for me " In Hell " is a strong based largely on its realism and Van Damme ' heart wrenching performance .
472699	11423174	49431	7.0	there's lots to like about this western	this is another good western , which i enjoyed . it's not an epic or anything , but it is good for what it is . it ' about 3 fur trappers , led by a men named Jed , who is crude and uncivilized . Jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and Indian band , who resent the Americans on their land , and want to take it back . that's the gist of the story . what follows is action , excitement , even a bit of humour , and forbidden romance . one of Jed's friends , Gus , reminded me a lot of the character Quint ( played by Robert Shaw ) in the movie Jaws . they both have that crusty , gruff demeanor . anyway , if you're a western fan , you should find lots to like about this particular entry . i think it deserves a
472646	11423174	443706	7.0	the movie itself is pretty decent , but the disc is bare bones ( 2 disc special edition comes out in ' 08 )	i didn't find too many problems with this movie . i mean , it is 157 minutes , but that doesn't really have a negative effect on the film . the acting is good all around , but no standout performances . the story is well written , and easy to follow . by the way , if you're not familiar with the story , Zodiac is a killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 60's early 70's . the case was never officially solved . a lot of the movie consists of quiet , dramatic moments , with a bit of subdued action here and there . the movie is compelling enough to maintain interest , but not outstanding . i did think , however , that the tone of the film was a bit too light for the subject matter . otherwise , though , it's pretty good . the DVD is bare bones , but there is a preview of a special 2 disc edition coming in 2008 , which promises insights into the case with in depth interviews from those involved in the original case and much more . i actually think this stuff will be more compelling than the movie . my advice , rent the bare bones edition and wait for the special edition .
472754	11423174	848557	7.0	well done	i enjoyed this film . it's the latest installment in George A . Romero's Dead series of films . it's not really a sequel to any of the other movies . it's more of a standalone feature . i thought this movie did a good job of portraying the paranoia and despair that would occur if such a situation were to happen . it follows a groups of college students and a professor as they document the events as they are happening on a video camera , so it's shot documentary style . i think this movie is an indictment of society and our morbid fascination with death . it's also an indictment of the media and how they can twist and spin everything , so you never really know what the truth is . and it also shows out dependence on technology . there's also plenty of gore here , if you're a gore hound . all in all , a well done movie . my vote for Diary of the Dead : a
473206	11423174	42895	7.0	final film in John Ford's Cavalry " trilogy "	to me , this third and final film of John Ford's Cavalry " trilogy " is better than the second entry , She Wore a yellow Ribbon , but not quite as good as the first entry , Fort Apache . this one has some exciting moments and a few funny moments , which were lacking in Ribbon . this one has quite a strong romance angle to it , which i didn't like that much . however , John Wayne is very good in these sensitive moments . we get to see more of Wayne in this one than in Ribbon , which is a good thing . Maureen O'Hara is also good as the romantic interest . however , i thought Claude Jarman Jr . was strong as as Trooper Jeff Yorke , son of the commanding officer , Lt . Col . Kirby Yorke , played by John Wayne . i was also impressed by Harry Carey Jr . ( one of Ford's regulars ) as Trooper Daniel ' Sandy ' Boone . i felt there were some slow moments here and there , but overall , i liked it . for me , Rio Grande is a
473203	11423174	111756	7.0	fascinating	this movie is quite a bit different than 1993's Tombstone . obviously it focuses on Wyatt Earp , more than anything . this movie paints quite a different picture of Earp than Tombstone does . it depicts him in a much different light . Kevin Costner's portrayal of Earp is much different than Kurt Russel's in Tombstone . i think i liked Russel's portrayal a bit more . Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday , and his portrayal is much different than Val Kilmer's in Tombstone . i actually liked Val Kilmer's performance better , and i liked his character more . Quaid does a good job though . the supporting cast is also very good . another big difference between this movie and Tombstone , is that this movie is very deliberately paced , and more in depth . the story is much deeper . there is not that much action , and some may be turned of by the length of the movie at over 3hrs . but if you can view it as character study , you might enjoy it . one thing i really liked rising the musical score . i found it very rousing and poetic . for me , Wyatt Earp is a
473645	11423174	53271	7.0	i liked it	sure , it may seem cheesy by todays ' standards , but it's good clean fun for the whole family , for the most part . really young children might be a bit scared from a few scenes , but other than that , it's fun for everyone . i chuckled quite a bit t some of the comedic bits , and i also thought the story was interesting . it's not just about the Shaggy Dog . there's another story in there as well . some of the facial expressions and reactions may seem a bit hokey and overdone , but so what . that was how they acted back then . if i recall correctly , this was the first motion picture made by Disney . i wouldn't say the comedic parts are laugh out loud , rolling in the aisles funny . , but they were certainly amusing . you could do a lot worse with 102 minutes or so . my vote for The Shaggy Dog :
473044	11423174	408345	7.0	suspenseful , thrilling ( if unoriginal ) action film	firewall stars Harrison Ford as a bank security specialist , who is forced into breaking into the system he has designed by a vicious criminal played by Paul Bettany . jack Stanfield ( Ford ) must steal millions of dollars from several bank accounts or his family will be killed . Bettany plays Bill Cox , the ringleader . Viginia Madsen plays Beth Stanfield . As far as this type of movie goes , this one is okay . it is suspenseful and thrilling , but aside from the basic premise , nothing new . Virginia Madsen is a standout in her performance as the wife who is terrified but must keep it together for the sake of her children . Ford is his usual reliable self , but it seems he is simply playing the same character he usually plays . he is also getting up there in age , so it might be time to retire the action hero persona , and try something more character driven . Paul Bettany is outstanding as the antagonist . he personifies evil . this is a departure for him , but he may have a career playing the baddie . His performance elevates this film . i give this film
472740	11423174	107978	7.0	now , thats more like it	after seeing how disappointing " RoboCop 2 " was , i did not have high hopes for this one . however , i was pleasantly surprised . while i didn't feel it was quite as good as the original , it was pretty close . it had a different kind of storyline than i was expecting . this story was pretty coherent , and had some unpredictability about it , which i liked . it also had some depth to it . there was a good mix of action , drama and humour , and the humour worked here . this movie has some genuinely funny moments . the movie is certainly less violent than the previous 2 , but that doesn't matter here . there's still plenty of explosions and car chases . the special effects in this one were pretty good , in my opinion . this movie is the most fun of the 3 . i believe most of the laughs were intentional , at least they came off that way . the series redeems itself with this installment . for me , " RoboCop 3 " is a strong
473191	11423174	486576	7.0	again , lacks the epic quality it should have , but it doesn't exactly suck	well , at least it didn't suck . but it wasn't as good as the potential hinted at . i guess it's maybe slightly better than the first one , but barely . the story is interesting and has some merit , but the execution of the film left me empty . the Silver Surfer is a pretty cool looking character , but i wish the character had been developed more . Having Laurence Fishburne voice the Surfer was a definite plus , as his voice fit the character perfectly . no disrespect to Doug Jones , who physically played the character . i'm mot sure i've heard Doug Jone's voice , so all i can comment on is Fishburne . like the first one , this movie is too short and seems rushed . it lacks the epic quality this type of movie should have . another problem is the characters didn't really have to do much more or different than they did in the first one . having said that , the movie is entertaining , if not compelling . even with it's problems , i'd give " Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer " . as a final word , if another installment or a possible Silver Surfer spin off , is planned as rumored , one can only hope they pull out all the stops and make whatever's next into what it really should be : an epic tale worthy of its source material . otherwise , there's no point and they should stop right now .
473256	11423174	74958	7.0	very bleak , but thought provoking , and ahead of its time	this is a pretty good movie , all things considered . the acting was really good , as was the writing , there is some great dialogue here . i think the movie could have been a bit shorter . i also found it kinda bleak . the whole idea that we only know what big conglomerates that own the media , specifically TV news , want us to know . since this movie was mad In 1976 , it was certainly ahead of its time , in that viewpoint . whether all that is true or not , i don't know . i do know that i never watch TV news or read news in the paper , mostly because it's all stuff . as for this movie , it is certainly very thought provoking and brings up interesting issues . based on that , and the acting and writing , i give Network a .
472625	11423174	109707	7.0	different	this is an interesting film , sort of a biopic of Edward D . Wood Jr . , or Ed Wood , as he is more famously known . Wood apparently was one of the most inept filmmakers , ever . but he was also passionate about film . he just had trouble raising money , so he had to make his films on the cheap , usually with his friends in the cast . he also had no real idea about how to make a movie . his Plan Nine from Outer Space was at one time considered the worst movie ever made , and Wood became world famous for that reason . unfortunately this was two years after he died . anyway , Johny Depp plays the title character . there are some other well known actors here as well . the movie is at times sad , funny , enlightening , and certainly interesting . i mostly liked it , though i don't think it was a masterpiece . for me , Ed Wood is a
472567	11423174	81071	7.0	above average western with some great gun battles	this is a movie about the James / Younger Gang of the old west and their exploits . the gang is known for robbing banks and they also rob trains . it's sort of told from a sympathetic view of the gang . the movie doesn't really show them as bad men , but rather men who are a product of their time . David Carradine plays Cole Younger , Keith Carradine plays Jim Younger and Robert Carradine plays Bob Younger . Stacy Keach plays Frank James , while James Keach plays Jesse James . Dennis Quaid plays Ed Miller and Randy Quaid Plays Clell Miller , who also ride with the gang . for me , this western is above average . there's lots of action and some intense and ( in my opinion ) spectacular gunfights . this movie may have the distinction of being the 1st movie to have real life brothers playing brothers on screen . i thought the acting was pretty convincing , and the filmmakers did a good job in making me feel some empathy for the gang . if you like westerns , you should like this movie . for me , " The Long Riders " is a
473531	11423174	257076	7.0	entertaining popcorn movie fills the gap	this is an entertaining movie , though there's not a lot of depth to it . it's not what i would call great by any stretch . i don't think it's too original either , but then again in today's movie climate , what movie is ? if it's not a remake , it's a sequel . in this case , it's a remake of a bad 1970 TV series . watching it won't make you feel any different than if you hadn't watched it . there's no lack of action and the characters are decent enough though no one really stands out . as far as popcorn movies goes , this one fills the gap for 117 minutes , but won't likely leave much of an impact when finished . you could do a lot worse than " Swat " to kill some time . just don't expect too much realism or originality .
472561	11423174	207333	7.0	decent ghost story , though not very intense ( very family friendly )	i didn't find this movie too bad . i was expecting something more intense . this is a fairly family friendly ghost story and there's nothing wrong with that . Elisha Cuthbert is the leading female character , while Ricky Mabe ( whose career so far has been mostly TV series and a one or two TV movies ) is the lead male character . the acting is fine , and the movie has bit of an eerie feel to it . however , i didn't really buy into the reason for the ghost haunting the estate . it just seemed too weak of an explanation to me . other than that , i don't have any major gripe with movie . like i said , it's pretty lite family fare , so you want see any blood or violence , and there's no bad language that i recall . it's rated PG for thematic material , but i don't think too many children over ten would have a problem with it . for me , " Believe " is a
473022	11423174	315885	7.0	quality family friendly viewing	i liked this movie a bit more than the first one . this one has more of a story , the characters have a bit more to do and the pace is quicker . there is some action , though i still wouldn't call it action packed . like the first , this is a decent family movie , though there are a few mild scenes of peril and some mild language . again , it might be a bit too much for very young children . still , it is quality family viewing . there's no real violence or sexual content . and there is a bit of humour in this one , which there really wasn't in the first one . there is also a bit more realism to this movie and it has a message of sorts , but it is not at all preachy . this movie isn't for everybody's taste , but if you like your movies low key and family friendly , this might be your movie . for me , Gentle Ben 2 is a
473472	11423174	465624	7.0	not super , but definitely worth watching	okay , the basic plot of the movie . guy ( Luke Wilson ) asks girl ( Uma Thurman ) on date . things go not too bad at first . guy discover girl has a secret super identity . also discovers she is crazy , neurotic , jealous , possessive-just plain nuts . so , guy breaks up with girl . she get angry and decides to get even . and since she has super powers , she can really get even . i'll leave it at that . i had higher hopes for this one . it isn't bad Per Se-it just had so much potential . it is billed as a comedy / romance / sc / fi . okay , there is some comedy , in fact a few very funny scenes , but most of the comedy consisted of the light chuckle , sort of amusing variety . now , romance . there is some romance involved and it is a bit schmaltzy at times , almost too much . there is a little bit of sc / fi , but that is the least developed area in the movie . there are some pretty decent special effects . the acting is good . Luke Wilson gives off a sort of " aw shucks " , ma'am " kind of vibe , which is amusing . Uma Thurman is credible in the lead role , and looks hot as always . Anna Farris is cast in a slightly more serious , less ditsy role than usual , and pulls it off nicely . there is no doubt she can act . she has been in some dramatic movies and fared well . but the stand out in this movie is Wanda Sykes , who provides most of the very funny scenes . she has a small , but brilliant role . i hope we see a lot more of her in the future . i should also mention the music . not good for this movie . we are treated to lots of sweeping majestic , almost inspirational sort of arias ( let's raise everyone's spirits ) . it is really just too much . and one last little observation . much of the sc / fi aspect is a rip-off of superman . this probably an homage , more than anything . not really a criticism , just an observation . but still worth mentioning . anyway , to sum up , not a bad movie , definitely watchable , just don't expect to be laughing hysterically all that frequently . this movie gets a strong
473054	11423174	313443	7.0	pretty good , if unoriginal	for this genre ( crime drama / thriller ) this movie is pretty good . it's certainly entertaining and thrilling . it's also pretty fast paced . the acting is decent but not spectacular . Denzel Washington plays the main character , and he has been better . Eva Mendes is also in the movie , and depending on your taste in women , may be reason enough to watch the movie . though the movie is of a serious nature it still comes off as a fluff piece . it isn't really original for the genre . there are a few twists and turns , for sure , but many movies of the genre have those . you probably won't be fooled too much , since most of the film is predictable . still , it's fun getting there . for me , Out of Time is a
472532	11423174	102059	7.0	an amusing , sometimes hysterical spoof on top gun	the movie hot shots is obviously a broad comedy . you really have to look at the big picture to understand its genius . it's sort of like the monty python gang doing their take on hamlet and playing it straight . that's the genius of hotshots , that the actors play it as if they too were doing hamlet . of course there are several funny bits contained in the movie , and two sequences which are absolutely hysterical . but it is the intentional over the top acting that really makes this movie . i suspect they may have had to do numerous takes for many scenes , because the actors could not keep a straight face . the dialogue is brilliant in this movie and delivered perfectly deadpan every time . and of course there is also some physical comedy , which doesn't hurt . this was a much more enjoyable movie than the naked gun series . i also must mention lloyd bridges who played a very important , and very dimwitted admiral . there are many absurd scenes which are brilliantly overacted . this is a fast paced movie , which kept me interested to the very end .
473275	11423174	403016	8.0	great stunts ( gives a new appreciation of the athletes in this sport ) wow !	this movie is not bad at all . some of the stunts these guys ( and girls ) do in Supercross is absolutely astounding . the way they flip in mid air and the heights they can reach . i have a new respect for these people . the stunts were mind blowing , but very realistic , as far as i could tell . there are some hot women in this movie , naturally . the acting is OK and to me , the plot is thin , but that is not the draw for this movie . the real reason to watch this movie , or any of the genre , are the amazing stunts these guys can do . to say they are talented is a huge understatement . i found this movie pretty exciting . it is only during the dramatic scenes that i didn't like it as much . i just wanted to see those stunts . thankfully , that is what most of the movie is . if you're a Supercross fan , you should love this movie . if you're not , you might still really enjoy it . at the very least , you should have a new appreciation for the athletes involved . my vote for " Supercross " :
473091	11423174	89945	8.0	entertaining spoof of the western genre and its conventions	i found this movie quite entertaining , and even amusing . i didn't think it was laugh out loud funny , ( i don't think it's that type of movie ) but it was still a good watch . it's a send up ( spoof ) of the western genre ) . one thing it pokes fun at is the strong macho image of the good guy . if you've seen many westerns , you'll get a lot of the jokes , some of which are accurate , and some of which exaggerate things a bit , or even a great deal . i've seen quite a few westerns , but even if you haven't seen even one , you'll likely still find the movie amusing . the movie is short , at under 90 minutes , and goes by very quickly . for me , Rustler's Rhapsody is an
473674	11423174	116705	8.0	great fun	i truly fail to see how this movie has such a low rating ( ) on this site . i mean not only is it funny , but it's action packed , and family friendly . this is one fast paced movie , that doesn't let up . it's a true comedy of errors . the acting is also great in this one Schwarzenegger is in great comedic form here , as is Sinbad . i don't usually find Sinbad funny , but he was in this movie . and Arnie has shown his comedic side in a few movies , but i never expected him to be this funny in a comedy that fires on all cylinders . the only negative thing i would say about this movie is that it strays a bit into sappy territory briefly . there are a few suggestive scenes , but these would be above the heads of most kids , so like i said , this is a family friendly movie . there are some very funny moments throughout , and the movie is always entertaining . for me , Jingle All the way is an
473455	11423174	105104	8.0	lots of great action and superb fight scenes	OK , i won't waste much time getting into the specifics of the film . here's all you really need to know . great action with superb fight scenes . awesome twisted villain . Wesley snipes plays the lead character , a no nonsense , kick ass terrorist buster . Bruce Payne portrays the truly evil baddie named Charles Rayne who has hijacked a plane which Snipes character just happens to be on . too bad for for Rayne . . there are also great supporting performances , most notably from Liz Hurley in a departure of sorts ( as far as i know ) there's a bit more to the movie which briefly sets the stage in the beginning of the movie . after that , mayhem . - people are shot and or killed , and bad guy and underlings attempt to kick the crap out of the god guy without getting killed . it's obvious who wins of course , but the fun is in getting there . and i can't'n forget that there's some dark humour and great one liners . thrown in for good measure , if you like your action movies lean and mean , and to the point , without any excess baggage aboard , this is your movie . so , buckle up , it's gonna be a bumpy ride .
473741	11423174	116731	8.0	terrific , well acted suspense thriller with a few twists	" The Juror " is a well paced suspenseful film , with great performances from the two main actors , Alec Baldwin , and Demi Moore . the supporting cast includes Anne Heche , James Gandolfini and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt . Demi Moore Plays Annie Laird , mother to Oliver , ( Levitt ) and also a juror juror in a high profile murder case against a mob leader . Annie is forced by a mob associate to convince the other jurors to render a verdict of non-guilty or her son or others she cares for will be harmed . the problem is , the jury is convinced of the guilt of the mobster and the evidence seems to indicate guilt . I won't say any more about the plot . i will say that what follows is loads of suspense and nail biting tension . Demi Moore is so convincing as the mother who feels helpless and Alec Baldwin is Brilliant as her tormentor . the movie doesn't end the way i thought it would ( and i mean that in a good way ) instead offering up a few twists i wasn't expecting right up until the final moments . A terrificly entertaining film , which relies ( very successfully ) on suspense and great performances .
473784	11423174	89927	8.0	better than the 3rd film in the series	Rocky 4 is a better movie than Rocky 3 . there is more depth to the story . The villain is a mush greater threat and there is more at stake . the is a second antagonist which Rocky must fight , but you will have to watch the movie to understand . the setting for the movie is also a positive . it is set in Russia in 1985 . the movie also has a moral which the three previous ones do not . this movie focuses much more om the training for the final fight than actual fight itself . the fight scenes are well done , but there is less realism . by that , i mean no man could tale any where near the punishment endured by Rocky and remain alive for the duration . other than that , the movie is well done . though not as good as Rocky2 , it is a close second to the original . A fine addition to the series .
473299	11423174	120512	8.0	pretty decent family viewing	this movie has the based on a true story tag , but i'm sure there were dramatic licenses taken . the people in the story are real and some of them are probably still around . that much is certain . beyond that , this movie makes for light , though pretty entertaining viewing . it does seem a bit far fetched at times , though . and the story is pretty thin . there is really nothing offensive about the movie that i can tell . there's is no foul language or nudity . there are a few intense scenes with animals that might be a bit too much for young children . i think the movie would be suitable for kids 10 or older , but parents should always use their discretion . overall , this is a fun movie the family could enjoy . for me , Wild America is
472600	11423174	102975	8.0	blew away my expectations	wow . going into this movie , my expectations were pretty low . i though it would be a decent movie , but not great . well , i don't no if it's great or not , but it's pretty darn close . this one has it all . sure , there's action , and quite a bit of it . and there also plenty of excitement to go along with it . and in liberal doses of humour coupled with the high intensity and suspense factor and you have one heck of a fun film . there are also the added elements of intrigue and mystery , which the previous had little of , if any . this is also the darkest installment up to that point . i think it is also the most ambitious of the six films . for me , this movie ranked right up there with the fourth installment The Voyage Home . there are some nail biting moments here . this movie is a for sure .
473349	11423174	78158	8.0	sequel to " Escape to Witch Mountain " and a bit better movie	in this follow up to " Escape to Witch Mountain " , Toni and Tia Malone ( Ike Eisenmann , Kim Richards ) , leave the safe confines of their home on Witch Mountain , to visit New York . They are a few years older and their psychic abilities have grown . once again an evil madman finds out about their powers and will stop at nothing to gain control of them . there is bit of a twist in this movie , which i liked . there is more humour in this than the first movie and there is more action . there are also a few scenes of mild peril , compared to the 1st one . the stakes are a lot higher in this one , not just for Toni and Tia , but the world . Toni and Tia are less naive this time around , so they provide better resistance against the bad guy . i really enjoyed this film , a bit more so than the 1st . if you liked " Escape to Witch Mountain " you should not be disappointed with this film . a strong
472989	11423174	1059786	8.0	a blockbuster popcorn flick	while this may be an action packed , thrilling movie , it is certainly full of holes and not too improbable , nor is it terribly original . it is fun though and fast paced , and if that's what your looking for , you'll enjoy it . conspiracy theorists will love this , and if you're not a fan of government / military , this will be right up your alley as well . there are plenty of explosions an car chases / accident . Shia LeBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are the main stars . Billy Bob Thornton . Rosario Dawson , Ethan Embry , Michael Chiklis and Anthony Mackie also star . it's basically a blockbuster popcorn movie . as a piece of entertainment , i think it does its job . it's not high art , or anything , but it's not supposed to be . i was quite entertained throughout . for me , Eagle Eye is an
472995	11423174	1325753	8.0	Hulk smash ! ! !	this is two stories in one . one is The Hulk against Wolverine , and the other is Hulk vs Thor . the first disc is Hulk vs Wolverine . i thought his feature was OK , but not great . the animation is great and there are some great characters besides the Hulk and Wolverine . we also have lady DeathStrike , which i love , as well Omega Red , Deadpool , and Sabretooth , all great villains . the action sequences are decent enough , though not stellar . i thought the story lacked a bit , and i was hoping for something more epic . as for Hulk vs Thor , to me , this is the better of the two . i liked the story better , the characters are more defined , the battle scenes between Hulk and Thor are epic , and the animation is outstanding . based on this feature alone , i think it's worth getting the package . right now , both stories are only sold together . down the road , they may be sold separately , in which case i would say , Hulk vs Thor is well worth the purchase , while i'd be a bit iffy on Hulk Vs Wolverine . right now , i would say , the package is worth buying for vs Thor alone .
472959	11423174	110657	8.0	Hilary Swank in an early role	this is the 4th movie in the Karate Kid series . however it has nothing to do with the previous 3 . the only character remaining is Mr Myagi . this time around Mr Myagi meets troubled teen Julie pierce ( Hliary Swank , before she was famous ) Julie having all kinds of Problem including being bullied at school by a guy , belonging to a pseudo military club on campus . Naturally she is trained how to fight . Anyway , through Myagi , Julie learns Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns how to respect herself and in the end regains her respect . i like the unique idea of the antagonist being a female and having a male as her enemy . i there are also some fight scenes which are done quite well , very low key and minimal violence . none of the fighting is graphic . the ending is also good and a bit surprising . it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film . the film has echoes of the original obviously , especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned . it is not as good as the 1st movie , and certainly not as good as the 2nd . it is however , a giant leap forward compared to the underwhelming 3rd entry . this is a very entertaining under dog movie that is suitable for the whole family .
473511	11423174	97659	8.0	the movie is pretty good , the songs are crap	" kickboxer " is one of Jean Claude Van Damme's earlier and better efforts . for a fan of the martial arts , it should satisfy . there aren't a lot of fight scenes , but what there is - - is pretty good . there is however , complaint i do have with this movie , and it's not so much the movie itself . it's the sht songs in it . once again , we have bad songs by a band that wouldn't rate in the worst fleabag bar . if you can't have decent music ( and i use that word very loosely ) , don't have any music at all . i did like the training montages . i thought they were kind of cool to watch , although they are pretty much the same as in " Bloodsport " , a previous Van Damme Vehicle . i don't think this movie is as good as " Bloodsport " , but it is still entertaining . for me , " Kickboxer is a
473779	11423174	118583	8.0	better than Alien3	Alien Resurrection , while not as good as Alien and Aliens , is better than Alien 3 . true , it is fairly light in tone , and not a lot of suspense . however it has a very eclectic group of characters . Ripley is back . there is some humour in this series , much more than the other Alien films . there is lots of action , but less gore than Alien 3 . there are also some surprising revelations in this one . it is not as predictable as Alien 3 . the aliens have undergone a transformation in this movie , as they have in each film in the series . they have a capability which was not explored in the original 3 . there was talk at one time of a fourth sequel , but let's hope they leave the series as is - - on a high note .
473118	11423174	75922	8.0	home invasion nightmare	i wouldn't call this movie a horror movie in the usual sense . it's certainly a thriller , and it is terrifying . it's a lot like deliverance but it takes place an isolated area , with no none around for miles , except the psychopaths and their victims . this is a very disturbing movie , with lots of very coarse , and crude sexual language and strong sexual references . but the most disturbing thing is that the events could happen as they did in the movie . it's very authentic . the performances are terrific from everyone and the intensity is through the roof in this one . if you're squeamish or don't like strong language or sexual references , you might want to avoid this movie . once it gets going , it doesn't let up . but for me , Death Weekend is an
473112	11423174	106770	8.0	entertaining	while it's hard to say how accurate this depiction of Bruce Lee is , there's no denying it is entertaining . one thing that is probably depicted fairly accurately is the racism Lee faced from street punks to those in the entertainment industry , all of whom should have known better . but the movie also has it's lite side . there is some humour to lighten things up . the action sequences are done pretty well , but maybe a bit over the top . Jason Scoot Lee handles the role of Lee very well , even though he may not fit Lee physically . he is much larger than Lee was . Lauren Holley is good as Lee's love interest ( and eventual wife ) Linda Emery . Michael Learned is particularly good as the mother of Linda Emery who does not approve of the union of the two , because Lee is Asian and her daughter is white . no doubt there are things this movie leaves out , and many things which are changed to make it more appealing to audiences , if you look at it as entertainment , you shouldn't be disappointed . for me , Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story is an
472903	11423174	433400	8.0	funny , very funny	" Just Friends is a pretty good movie . it's funny , ( sometimes ridiculously so ) well acted and very well written . The basic plot is this : it is 1995 , And fat , sensitive and unpopular high school student Chris Brande ( Ryan Reynolds ) is about to reveal his true , deeper feelings for his longtime best friend Jamie Palamino ( Amy Smart ) . However , Chris becomes the victim of a horrible prank and is humiliated . on top of that he discovers that Jamie sees him a just a friend . So Chris leaves town and never looks back . flash forward 10 years , and Chris is a successful , rich ( and thin ) music executive who has no problem with the ladies . Through a series of events , Chris ends up back in his hometown . you can guess the rest . Anna Faris ( absolutely hysterical ) also stars in the movie as a ditsy , sex starved client of Chris's who ends up in tow with him back to his hometown . Aside from being a funny , well done movie , the movie also has a lesson to teach . however it is not preachy or heavy handed . the movie is also one of those rare examples of a film being funny , but not vulgar , or offensive or sick . ( Though those movies can be good too ) no potty humor here . summing up , i liked the movie a lot , much more than i thought i would .
472656	11423174	466909	8.0	stands well on its own merit , nearly as good as the original	after finally seeing the Omen ( 2006 version ) i have to say it is not as bad as i had thought it would be . as the two leads ambassador thorn and his wife , Liev Schrieber and Julia Styles are cast well . however , the child cast as Damien is not so well cast . he is more annoying than terrifying . Mia Farrow is brilliantly cast as the sinister nanny . Pete Postlewaite does quite well as the anguished Father Brennan , and David Thewlis is adequate as reporter Keith Jennings . now to the plot of the film . the movie follows the plot of the 1976 original structurally , with a few minor alteration within its composition . I won't go into all of these differences , but there is one noteworthy change i must mention . the death of Mrs Thorn is done in a much more subtle way than the original . this scene may be the one aspect of the remake that is superior to the original . it does retain much of the original Jerry Goldsmith music , which of course elevates its fright factor . as a stand alone movie , it is at times very effective and quite well done . as a remake it is nearly equal to the original . out of 10
473535	11423174	407304	8.0	focuses more on the human element	when i first saw this film in the theatres , i was not too impressed . the movie didn't have much of an impact . however , upon watching on DVD recently i have a different impression . i really liked it this time around . there are some terrifying scenes , which gave me goose bumps . I recently reviewed another movie with Tom Cruise , where i said that although he has screen presence , i didn't think he is a good actor . i may have to adjust my opinion on that subject , at least as far as this movie is concerned . in this movie Cruise plays the everyman , and does a very good job of it . he had me convinced . Dakota Fanning so far , seems to be quite talented , but she annoyed me little in this movie . i found her too whiny at times . Tim Robbins has what amounts to little more than a cameo , and was just used as a plot device . as for the movie , the effects were very good . there was CG used , but it's pretty seamless . the aliens were very well done . this movie is more character driven , then effects and noise . i put this movie way above " Independence Day " in terms of the alien Invasion genre . but then , that movie focused on special effects and spectacle more than anything else . for me " War of the Worlds is an
473107	11423174	89901	8.0	fun , but insubstantial	i can only speak for myself , but i enjoyed this movie . i thought it moved along at a good clip . Fred Ward was good as the title character , but Joel Grey was a real hoot as his Korean mentor Chiun . Wifred Brimley plays the head of the organisation that recruits Remo . Kate Mulgrew ( Captain Janeway in Star Trek Voyager ) is also in the movie . even though i liked the movie , i didn't fell it was very substantial , and after watching it , it felt incomplete . i suspect they were hoping to do a franchise , but the movie wasn't a commercial success , so they abandoned the idea . too bad , because it would have been good to see Remo progress in his training and take on new adventures . for me , Remo Williams : The Adventure Begins is an
473649	11423174	47706	8.0	i liked it	i really liked this TV show of Robin Hood . the acting is quite good , the stories are good , and the episodes are very well paced , not too fast , and not too slow . plus , as far as i can tell , this is a show the whole family can enjoy . it's not really violent . the fight scenes are more hokey than anything . but i mean that in a good way . it works in this case . plus i think it has a good moral , although it doesn't hit you over the head with it . each episode is a fun 25 minutes or so . apart from this , the only other Robin Hood i have seen is the 1938 film with Errol Flynn , which i also liked . Richard Greene plays the title character , and seems pretty natural in the role , in my opinion . the supporting players are also very good . all in all , a well done series .
473665	11423174	30491	8.0	well done	even thought this movie was made in 1938 , the picture and sound quality are excellent . there are also subtitles , which was good . the movie itself is funny , fast paced , and well acted . Bonita Granville plays the title character , and brings some sassiness to the role . i also liked the supporting cast , particularly her Sidekick Ted . i thought he had some funny lines . the chief of police was also a funny character . i thought the writing was good and i liked the story . even though the movie is 66 minutes , it didn't feel rushed or incomplete . it was well paced . this is the first of four movies in which Bonita Granville portrays Nancy , and if this any indication , i can't wait to watch the other three . for me Nancy Drew - - Detective is an
472934	11423174	493464	8.0	logic ? what's that ?	if you go into this movie , expecting logic and / or realism , you will be disappointed . it has almost neither of those elements . nor is it original . what it is , however , is wall to wall action , with death defying stunts and explosions galore . the acting is adequate , though it doesn't really mater here , as it ( and everything else ) takes a back seat to the spectacle . however , i will say that the casting of Morgan Freeman was a very inspired choice . you get to see him in a role quite different than usual for him , and you get to hear him say words you wouldn't normally hear from him . James McAvoy plays the hero , and does a flawless Shia Labeouf impression . Angelina Jolie plays a prominent role , and Terrence Stamp has what is pretty much a cameo appearance . as for the movie itself , it is intense , loud , and frenetic and there is one plot twist i didn't see coming , though most people probably will . anyway , found it to be a fun waste of time , thought not really memorable .
473830	11423174	106977	8.0	three words : Tommy Lee Jones	this action / thriller / murder mystery is directed By Andrew Davis ( Under Siege ) it is intended to be a Harrison Ford vehicle , but the movie is really owned by Tommy Lee Jones . Jones plays a U . S . Marshall on the trial of a a high profile , respected doctor ( Ford ) who finds himself accused of the murder of his wife ( Sela Ward ) . Jones brings some great intensity to role , yet at the same time he manages to be understated . not an easy task , but Jones is more than equal to the task . this movie is based The series of the same name from the 60's , but how accurate It is to its source material is anyones guess . obviously the film has been updated for contemporary audiences . the movie is quite exciting and fast paced , with some good suspenseful moments . there's also a few plot twists to keep you guessing . i rather enjoyed it . for me , " The Fugitive " is an
472923	11423174	66193	8.0	check this one out if you have a chance	this is a very cleverly written movie by Neil Simon . it's directed by Arthur Hiller . it's a ' everything that can go wrong does ' comedy . and it is funny . it's not dirty or filled with foul language , like many of our modern film use for laughs , or try to anyway . it stars jack Lemmon as a strait laced , high strung worry wart salesman , and Sandy Dennis as his down to earth calming influence wife . George Kellertman ( Lemmon ) and his wife ( Gwen ) are on a trip from small town life to the big city , ( New York ) where George has a very important interview that could put his career on the fast track . it should be aroutine trip . the only problem will be getting there . Neil Simon really has a gift for words . the dialogue i this is witty , intelligent and sharp . the words just seem to flow smoothly , whether it's subtle conversation or rapid fire interplay between George nd Gwen , or themselves and others . But Lemmon and Dennis deserve a lot of credit . they work perfectly off each other . bringing realism to the characters and sympathy . whoever cast these 2 together hopefully got a huge bonus for doing so . there are also some funny cameo appearances by some stars of the day . this is one terrific little movie . it's charming and warm and has heart . it may be low key , but it works . i vaguely remember watching the remake with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and being less than impressed . for me , the original " The Out of Towners " is a definite
473233	11423174	337960	8.0	under-appreciated man floats away in deck chair to a new life	what a gem this movie is . i had seen it advertised several times , and thought it would be boring . however , it happened to be on today , and there was nothing else on , so i thought i'd take a chance . boy , am i glad i did . this movie has a very original premise , great characters , good writing , and good acting . the movie basically tells the story of Danny Morgan ( Rhys Ifans ) a cement worker who finds out his girlfriend thinks very lowly of him and may have cheated on him . anyway , long story short , Danny ends up floating away in a deck chair to a new life . i won't say any more because i don't want to spoil it . let's just say Danny meets some new people and learns some life altering lessons . this is a romantic comedy of sorts , but 1 that most guys would appreciate and enjoy . the beautiful Miranda Otto plays the romantic interest . the romance isn't the heart of the movie , though . the movie is concerned more with the life of Danny ( Ifans ) and those who he meets on his travel . this is a small Australian movie , and it proves you don't need a huge budget or big name stars to make a movie work . but you do need an original story with likable characters , which this one has . if you have a chance to see this movie , i urge you to do so .
473292	11423174	277296	8.0	not quite up to the standard of " The Mummy " films , but still rates pretty high	this film is a prequel to both of " The Mummy " films stars " The Rock ( Dwayne Johnson ) in the title role . i don't think this film measures up to either of the two " Muumy " films , but it's still pretty good . the fight scenes are quite good , there is some humour , tons of action and good acting . The Rock actually impressed me with his acting ability . he showed a lot of potential in this film and didn't stink up the theatre , as i thought he would . this movie doesn't have a lot to do with the previous entries . the story is quite a bit different . there is a lot more mysticism and romance and none of the main characters from the first two have returned for this movie . this is really The Rock's movie , and he has to carry it . he does a pretty good job for his first big starring feature . though not as good as the two " Mummy " films , tit still rates high in my book . for me , " The Scorpion King " is a solid
472545	11423174	427392	8.0	it's a heart thumper ,	but it's also thought provoking . it makes you wonder what you might do if a similar scenario were to occur . how would you react ? would you resist , or would you quietly accept your fate . i liked the movie , myself . i'm not usually a fan of Nicole Kidman , but i liked her in this movie . i wish Daniel Craig had had a more significant role . he really didn't have a lot to do . there are a lot of intense moments in the film , lots of action . in fact , the film focuses more on action than the psychology of the events taking place . had it been the other way around , this would have been a very different movie . i still liked it . i'm not sure why it did so poorly at the box office . it's very relevant in today's climate . for me , The Invasion is an

Steven ( Brody ) still lives at home with his parents and his sister Heid . i ( Illeana Douglas ) to say his family is dysfunctional is an understatement . Milla Jovovvich plays Fangora Steven's friend and aspiring singer . she lives with her mother , who is a total bch and seems to think the only reason Fangora is around is to run errands for her . Vera Farmiga plays Lorena , who works in the employment office where Steven Shows up one day after being fired from his job . Farmiga puts in another great performance . She has built a career out of small , sometimes supporting character roles . regardless , she is possibly the most underrated actress out there . as for Jovovich , she is barely recognizable in a very unglamorous , tomboy kind of role , but she pulls it off convincingly . overall this movie is a real gem and should not be missed . if you haven't seen it , you should do so . a very strong
472919	11423174	221218	8.0	pretty good suspense thriller	i enjoyed this movie . it has suspense , action , drama , and decent acting . it has a pretty dark tone to it , which i liked . while it have the same high octane adrenaline rush of " Joy Ride " which also starred Leelee Sobieski and also came out the same year , it's still pretty good in its own right . there's more of a slow build up to tension in this movie . i also think this movie demands a bit mote of its actors , especially for the the quiet dramatic moments . the cast acquit themselves fairly well here . the movie is fairly well written , though not wholly original ( but there are some original elements to it ) for me " The Glass House " is an
472564	11423174	112692	8.0	i found it suspenseful and unpredictable ( i liked it )	you know , i really liked this movie . i thought it was suspenseful and exciting , with some twists i didn't see coming . i also didn't see the ending coming either , which , for me , is a good thing in a movie . there are a number of suspects in the movie and it really keeps you guessing . i also like Kim Delaney a lot . i think she's a pretty decent actress . i'm still not sure why she was let go from CSI : Miami , but that's another story . she plays the lead in this movie , a thriller writer named Kate Saunders . Kate begins receiving these strange e-mails from someone calling himself Thrillkill . Thrillkill has apparently been inspired by a villain in one of Kate's novels . his messages even claim he was created by Kate . Thrillkil begins killing women in exactly the same way as the villain in Kate's novels . i won't say anymore about the plot . lets just say what follows is suspense and excitement , and some twists . i liked " Closer and Closer " quite a bit . for me , it's a strong
473037	11423174	105046	8.0	good movie , but i thought the original was a bit better	this almost exactly the same as the original 1939 version , yet i found it a bit slow and not quite as compelling . Gary Sinise directed and stars in the movie , along with John Malkovich . Sinise is very good as Gary , one half of a drifter duo , who travel the countryside looking for work and trying too stay out of trouble . Malkovich is mesmerizing in the role of Lenny the large man with the intellect of a child . Lenny is the reason they must keep moving . Gary tires to keep him out of trouble , but when that fails , they must movie on . i found this version lighter in tone than the original , but again , it is also tragic , just like the original . it's a good movie , but i just didn't like it as much as the original . for me , Of Mice and Men is an
473198	11423174	50468	8.0	Kirk Douglas is great as Doc Holliday	i thought this was a good movie . the actual gunfight referred to in the movie is a very small part and happens close to the end . most of the movie is a buildup to that point . we get to know the characters and their motivations . The character of Wyatt Earp is portrayed by Burt Lancaster , and it took me awhile to warm up to his characterization , but eventually he won me over . Kirk Douglas plays Doc Holliday and he is brilliant . his charisma just jumps off the screen . Deforest Kelley plays one of the Earp brothers and a very young Dennis Hopper plays one of the Clanton gang . i liked the fact that the story was developed . it moves at a good pace , and i never found it boring .
473650	11423174	66249	8.0	a different type of Sherlock Holmes movie	though i haven't seen every Sherlock Holmes movie ever made , i have seen a few , and this one is much different . i found it darker in tone , and with a very compelling story . it also delves deeper into the character of Holmes , in a personal light . i liked the story and i also liked the acting . i had not seen a Billy Wilder film before , and probably never would have , if it weren't for this being a Sherlock Holmes movie . but i thought his was a well done movie . there's a definite sadness to it that isn't in any of the other Holmes movies i have seen . there a few comic bits . actually more like dark humour . it's around 2 hours in length , but doesn't feel long at all . for me , The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is an
472982	11423174	422720	8.0	witty and stylish	for a period movie , i felt this was more lite hearted than most . i found it witty , even funny at times . it movies along at a good pace , and is never boring . the movie is also virtually very nice to look at . even though the overall tone of the film is fairly lite , it does treat the more serious issues with the darker tone the deserve . much of the music for the movie is contemporary , which might not work for some people , but i didn't mind it . at first , i didn't care for much of the acting , but the performances grew on me quickly . Kirtsen Dunst shines in the title role . Jason Schwartzman is also good . in a what seems a strange casting choice , Rip Torn also appears in the movie . but Torn makes his character work . though i thought this movie was exceedingly entertaining , i wish the ending had been different . it just didn't work for me . many people may not liker the fact that the movie is done in a lite hearted way , but that didn't bother me here . if it wasn't for the ending , i would have given this movie a higher vote . but as it stands , i give Mare Antoinette an
472976	11423174	118670	8.0	good tension filled , high pressure movie	this is one movie that doesn't hold back in its depiction of a racist , ignorant pig who also happens to be a psychopath . this movie is not for the faint of heart . Charles Sheen puts in very convincing performance as a firefighter named Lyle Wilder , who in public is a hero but in reality is is a very unhinged deranged nut case with serious mental issues . in short , he's a loon , and a deadly one at that . Mare Winningham plays the mother of the family that is lucky enough to be his neighbour . i don't recall this movie being in theatres , but it's not listed as being straight to video . anyway , Winningham is good in her role and plays her character as very understated . i have to make special mention of two other actors in this movie . that would be John Ratzenberger ( Cliff , from " Cheers " fame ) and Dawn Lewis ( Jaleesa from the sitcom " A Different World ) who play the two police officers who end up dealing with Wilder ( Sheen ) . both were very impressive in fairly small roles . i though they were both standouts . i had never seen either in a serious role , and they seemed to fit their characters like a glove . the movie itself is tense , to say the least and you are really waiting for the pressure to burst and the psycho to come completely unraveled , which he does . in my mind , this is a pretty good movie . for me , " Bad Day on the Block " AKA " Under pressure is an
473204	11423174	90022	8.0	very good western	this is another western i thoroughly enjoyed . i really liked the story and the interesting mix of characters . this was Kevin Costner's first big role , and he certainly has fun with his character . Kevin Kline though is really a standout here . but there are also some other great actors involved . Brian Dennehy is good , as is Scott Glenn , and Danny Glover . I also really liked Linda Hunt as Stella . but again , there is one actor who i felt just didn't fit in this movie . that was Jeff Goldblume . he just seemed out of place to me . the movie itself is well paced , and has a very rousing score , which is perfect for this film . so far though , there are two westerns which are my favourite up to this point . both Open Range , also with Kostner ( and Robert Duvall ) and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford . however , Silverado is still an immensely entertaining film . for me , it's a strong
473839	11423174	118661	8.0	what is so bad about this movie ? c'mon people	i fail to see what was so wrong about this movie . the low rating ( on this site ) doesn't do it justice . i know the studio did little or no advance viewings or promotion . i'm guessing people jumped on the bandwagon , making sure they slammed it in earshot of every one they knew , before even seeing . trust me , there's a lot worse movies out there than this , many of which should never have been made , let alone released . this movie had action , some romance , some humour and excitement yes this is not Sean Connery's finest hour as he is way over the top . and yes , there are a couple of pretty absurd scenes . but honestly , it's not that bad a movie . i was very entertained . Uma Thurman was in it , for crying out loud . and in a skintight black leather outfit . what more do you need ? OK , that last part would appeal mostly to guys , but still . i am definitely bucking a trend here and giving " The Avengers " an
473611	11423174	457513	8.0	A very well executed murder mystery comedy from Woody Allen	having only seen one Woody Allen Movie prior to this , ( Purple Rose of Cairo ) and years ago , i didn't know what to expect . i was very impressed with this movie . i liked the directing style and the writing . Allen wrote directed , and starred in the movie . Scoop is a murder mystery comedy starring Scarlett Johansson , Hugh Jackman and Allen himself . Johansson plays Sondra Pransky , an American journalism student ( visiting London ) who receives a major scoop about a series of murders in London . Allen plays Sid Waterman a quirky , nervous , magician , who Sondra meets while participating in one of his tricks . it is here that Sondra receives the Scoop . Sondra drags Sid into the mystery and together they look for clues about the murders . Along the way , they meet Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman ) son of Lord Lyamn ( Julian Glover ) who plays a prominent role in the mystery . Ian McShane has a small but pivotal cameo . at first , Allen is annoying and grating what with his quirky mannerisms and all ( stuttering , fast talking hyper activity , nervousness ) but he quickly becomes very endearing . Allen is very quick with the wit in this movie and he's so natural at it . Scarlett Johansson also has some funny lines and her and Allen work off each other brilliantly , there is no denying the chemistry between them . the whole movie is very well written , with sharp , crisp dialogue all through . the method in which Sondra receives the scoop is ingenious , but i won't reveal it here . the movie is very low key and subtle but very effective . a strong
472573	11423174	120776	8.0	Streep is brilliant	this is one very good movie . it's all about love and loss , two pretty heavy themes . it's not at all depressing , but there's a lot of depth her , bot to the story and to the performance of Meryl Streep . there are good supporting performances , such as Renee Zellwegger , and William Hurt . James Ekhouse ( The dad from the Original Bevery hills 90210 ) who i really like as an actor , has a small role , as does Tom Everett Scott . but the movie belongs to Streep , who who is brilliant here . also the makeup artists did brilliant work here , as well . this is no lite drama . it's pretty thought provoking . it's pretty intense , so it's not for everyone . but if heavy drama is your thing , you might want to check out this movie .
473846	11423174	375210	8.0	solid " voices from the grave " thriller	once again , we have a movie with an inexplicably low rating . it's a movie about the afterlife , and one way the dead may contact the living . whether you believe in the science of it or not , isn't really the point . after all , it's not a documentary . it's a psychological suspense thriller . and in my mind , it succeeds as such . it is genuinely eerie and creepy , and i don't mind saying , the hair on my neck stood up more than once . the performances are good , at least i thought so and the movie is as good as any of the genre so far . is undeserved , in my mind . i'ts not perfect by any means , but not too many movies are . i'd give " White Noise " an
472701	11423174	59017	8.0	lite hearted and funny western romp	this was a fun , mostly lite heated western romp . the emphasis is on comedy here , but there is also plenty of action . this is also a musical of sorts , with some great songs sung by Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole . the movie starts off as Cat Ballou ( Jane Fonda ) waits to be hanged . from there , though , we get a flashback that tells of us of the events that led up to that point . for me , this was an action packed comedic movie . there are a few dark moments , but not too many . aside from Jane Fonda in the title role , Lee Marvin stars as a former gunfighter , but now a washed up drunk . i thought he was very amusing . the rest of the supporting cast is also good , providing some more comedic moments . for me , this was a fun , and fast paced western well worth watching .
472720	11423174	219653	8.0	stylish	this is one stylish take on the Dracula mythos . it certainly looks great . Gerard Butler is great as the tile character . this next sentence could be deemed a major spoileras far as i know this is the first movie about Dracula which puts a biblical slant on his origin . if you're Christian , especially Catholic , there's a lot in this movie that might offend you . in fact , the movie pretty much bashes ( subtly , if that's possible ) all things Catholic . for myself , i wasn't offended by it at all . i liked the new slant on an old idea . this is quite a dark movie , but it does have splashes of macabre humour throughout . the music was also great . all in all , it's lots of fun
473509	11423174	478073	8.0	way , way above average for this genre	this is a really good TV mini-series . it starts off really slow though . but once it gets going , it really improves . you get little hints at a time of what's happening , so you really get hooked . for an alien invasion movie , this one is low key and on a lower scope . this is not a criticism , and if you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean . i really got caught up in this thing . the special effects are not spectacular , but they aren't bad enough to take away from the movie . believe me , there are a lot worse in that dept . the strong part of this movie is the story and the acting of Daryl Hannah . she puts in a very strong performance in this movie . as for the story itself , while it may not be wholly unique , it is well written and well paced . the only thing i was disappointed in is the ending . it wasn't a bad ending , but it just seemed anti-climatic and not that realistic . otherwise , a very good movie . i highly recommend it . for me , " Final Days of Planet Earth " is an
473280	11423174	451262	8.0	low budget , but creepy and suspenseful	WithIN aka " The Cavern " starts off slow and has some dialogue and scenes in the beginning which should have been cut from the movie , as they weren't necessary . however , once it gets going , it's actually not a bad movie . i liked the camera work , especially the tight shots in the cavern . also in certain scenes it was hard to tell it where the characters were or if they were moving up or down . this was done deliberately to keep the viewer off balance and uneasy . it worked quite well as i was unsettled throughout most of the movie . the movie also had sort of a documentary style to it , which i thought added to the atmosphere and gave it a more authentic feel and i liked the inventive use of the camera . i'm fairly sure it had a very modest budget , yet that didn't detract from the quality of the film . i didn't recognize any of the actors , but they all did a good job and were believable . this was good , since big name actors would have taken the focus away from the story , and taken the viewer out of the movie . the cavern wasn't a particularly scary movie , but it was creepy and suspenseful . I don't recall seeing anything quite like it . there are some scenes which may be a bit to gory for some people and there is one fairly intense violent scene . the ending was different than i expected , but not in a bad way . the filmmakers managed to fit a lot into the short running time , but i still believe it could have been a bit longer . otherwise , a pretty good , not quite great movie that will keep you entertained . i bought it and have no regrets . definitely worth renting , at least .
473777	11423174	457495	8.0	danger , excitement and fun , for both adults and kids	i really enjoyed this movie . it's similar to James Bond , except the spy is a 14 year old kid . there's even a bunch of gadgets , just like In Bond , and there's a version of Q , the guy in charge of the gadgets . this movie has a pretty serious bent , overall , but it also has it's campy , over the top moments . there's plenty of action , intrigue and suspense . and of course , it is also funny at times . the acting is also top topnotch , in my mind anyway . kids and adults will equally enjoy this movie , though it's probably not appropriate for young kids , due to a few dark themes . the ending sets up nicely for a sequel , which was probably planned , but the movie did not do so great at the box office . If you liked Agent Cody Banks , which was similar , but more of comedy , you might want to give this one a try . my vote for Alex Rider : Stormbreaker is a
473705	11423174	134619	8.0	Disturbing behavior-to say the least	Disturbing behavior is the tale of a small coastal town where once unruly teens are transformed into academic geniuses . even stranger is that they all dress the same , join the same clubs , act the same . like soulless automatons . when Steve Clark ( James Marsden ) moves into town , he makes friends with the three misfits : Rachel Wagner ( Katie Holmes ) , Gavin Strick ( Nick Stahl ) and U . V ( Chad Donela ) . once the three realize the reason for the abrupt behavior changes , they must find a way to stop it , before they are next . Bruce Greenwood , ( Thirteen Days , Deja Vu ) William Sadler , ( The Green Mile , Hard to Kill , Ethan Embry ( Harold and Kumar go to White Castle , Sweet Home Alabama ) and Katherine Isabelle ( Earthsea , Insomnia ) also have roles in the film . i thought this was a pretty good film . the premise is not original , but so what . the movie is very dark and will be thought provoking for some , while others will simply enjoy it for it's entertainment value . either way , it's worth watching .
472932	11423174	460651	8.0	a fresh approach to the the alien invasion theme	i mostly enjoyed this sci / fi entry . the take on the alien ( if that's what they are ) invasion concept is done differently here than in other movies / TV shows of the genre . the concept is clever , the script is well written , and the suspense builds at just the right pace . right from the get go , curious things happen in the town , with more than one explanation offered . as more and more people begin to suspect something is wrong , things really heat up ( the only minor quibble i have is that there did tend to be some repetitiveness at times ) . hard to believe this gem was created by Shaun Cassidy , former 70's teen heartthrob . but Cassidy has come up with an original , inventive show that i wish had found an audience , and lasted more than one season . the way the series ended was quite the cliffhanger , and so there is no resolution . you will have to use your imagination . anyway , i enjoyed the show , and would recommend it to others . for me , Invasion is an
473881	11423174	91624	8.0	TV news anchor faces moral dilemma	this movie basically about a moral and ethical dilemma facing a popular news anchor . martin Sheen Plays news anchor Frank Kenley , newly hired by a news station flailing in low ratings . Kenley is brought on board because he is respected int thee field , and it is hoped he will bring the stations ratings up . things go well , until Frank is faced with moral dilemma , whether to go public with some information that may damage a certain individual'd reputation , or withhold the information , and not letting the public know the story , possibly endangering others in the process . Kendry is faced with 2 obstacles - rookie reporter / co anchor Christine Arnold ( Sheree . J . Wilson ) whose enthusiasm and inexperience only make things worse-and his boss Eric Ross ( Peter Riegert ) who has no moral centre and will do whatever it takes to increase ratings , no matter who gets hurt . this is a made for TV movie ( 1985 ) but it is pretty well done . good acting all around and an important issue : morals and ethics . this can be applied to life in general , not just in the news room and you can't help but think about it after the credits roll . i've said this before , i don't normally go in for issue and moral type movies , but this movie is also entertaining , and well done .
472583	11423174	80007	8.0	very entertaining movie with likable characters	call me crazy , but i enjoyed this movie . it won't win any awards or anything , but it is is entertaining and well paced . the acting is okay for this type of movie . it feels like a made for TV movie , but that's not necessarily a bad thing . from watching it , i got the impression it is a sequel , since they showed some flashbacks involving one of the main characters . i found out later that it is a sequel to " the Savage Bees " . but it works well on its own , although i do plan on seeing the prequel sometime . if your looking for lots of tension and suspense , you won't find too much here , although there are one or two mildly suspenseful moments . i think the appeal of this movie is the likability of the characters . also it moves at a decent pace and isn't at all boring . i give " Terror Out of the Sky "
472890	11423174	357507	8.0	better than average for the genre	this movie is similar plot wise to two other films in the genre . very similar to 2003's Darkness Falls and to a lesser extent 2002's They . however , i felt that Boogeyman had a well developed back story , which the other are lacking , in my opinion . i also felt there was more depth to this story and a dark sinister feel . there are seems to me to be a subplot which suggests there's more going on . but i could be out to lunch here . it wouldn't be the first time . i found the creature was much more evil by what's implied , more than what's shown . i sorta wish they had developed this area even a bit more . but at least they give subtle clues to the monster's origin . as for the ending , i thought it was decent enough for the genre , although nothing is really resolved . but i thought there were other reasons this film works . the first is the casting of Emily Deschanel , who plays the role of Kate , former childhood friend of Tim , the lead character . i felt she really had some screen presence presence , plus some good emotional depth and range . i realize this genre of film isn't the best indicator of acting ability , but i noticed it anyway another reason i thought this movie stood out is the performance of young Skye McCole Bartusiak . i will refer to her simply as Skye from hereon due to her long name . Skye plays a pivotal role in the film , which i will not give away . the astonishing thing about her performance is her young age . i thought she had great depth and range for someone so young . n my mind , the film is elevated by these two performances . as an aside , Emily can now be seen in the forensic themed TV show Bones as one of the the lead characters . any way back to the movie . my overall overall impression is that the movie is better than average for its genre-very spooky at times to-be sure . and even without some great acting , i think this is still an effective movie . anyway , for me , this movie is much more than a standard horror film . but that's just me . i think Boogeyman is a
473047	11423174	396752	8.0	I quite enjoyed it ( a good family film )	this is a good movie . it is directed by Kirk Jones , writer and director of " Waking Ned Devine " it has something for everyone . mild rude humour for the kids , bit of romance for the adults . okay maybe teens won't like it . It is a fantasy movie , so it obviously much of it is not realistic of course . it echoes 1964's sound of music , but is more complex and has more depth . Ther are some dark moments which may be a little frightening for really young children , so use your discretion . the film is very colourful and well photographed . The acting is very good , although this not a film where the actors had to dig deep to find their characters . Anyway , Mr . Brown ( Colin Firth - " Bridget Jonse's Diary 1 and 2 " , " Love Actually " ) has a problem . he is a single father with 7 uncontrollable children . They have managed to drive away every Nanny he has hired , usually in days or less . the local Nanny agency will no longer supply him with a nanny telling him at one point something along the lines of " they're all gone " , you've driven them all away " . So , one day , in walks the mysterious Nanny Mcphee ( Emma Thompson , Love actually , " Stranger Than Fiction " , also wrote the screenplay based on the children's novels " Nurse Matilda , by Christianna Brand ) . but she is no ordinary Nanny , as is quickly revealed . what follows is chaos , comedy romance until what should by now be the obvious ending . the beautiful and very talented Kelly Macdonald ( " Finding Neverland " , " The Girl in the Cafe " plays the love interest . Angela Lansbury also appears in the movie as does Imelda Staunton . overall , a fun family film .
473486	11423174	97368	8.0	i thought it was as good as the original , but definitely not for the squeamish	this sequel to " The Fly " isn't all that bad , all things considered . it is however , more disgusting , believe it or not . a lot of the really gross stuff was overkill and gratuitous , i thought . in the original , the gross scenes were sort of necessary to the story . not so in this movie . also found the movie to have some slow spots at times , which in my mind , took away from the flow of the story . as well , this movie had a slicker more polished look than the original , which i think kind of takes away from the effect . the acting is not bad , and i liked the direction the story went . i really liked the ironic ending . i won't give it away , but let's just say that one S . OB really got what he deserved . i actually almost cheered at this . if you watch the movie , you'll know why . a word of caution : this movie is definitely not for the squeamish . for me , overall , i'd say i liked this movie as well as the first one . therefore , i give " The Fly 2 "
473283	11423174	301470	8.0	the creeper returns	" jeepers creepers 2 " is what jeepers creepers 1 should have been-a good movie . there are plenty of hair raising moments in the movie , and enough action to keep the movie going . the acting was good , for the most part and the look of the " creeper " was well done . jonathan breck was great as the title character . ( the creeper ) this a case where the sequel far surpasses the original in all respects . whereas the original was lame i . e boring and stupid , with no scares to mention , number two was neither lame , boring or stupid , but a genuinely creepy movie . the original also tended to be downright disgusting at times , where this movie relied more on suspense rather than some lame attempt at shock value . if a movie is well made , there is no need to gross out the audience . also , this movie will stick with you long after you watch it and for all the right reasons . the only thing that really lingers from the original is how sick it was-and not in a good way . as well , you can easily watch this movie without first subjecting yourself to the original . it stands on it own as an original movie . rent ( or buy ) this movie , you won't regret it . avoid the original . it should never have been made , and the fact that it was is the only scary thing about it
473384	11423174	120755	8.0	not hard to follow , but the script blew up in the first of way too many explosions	this movie is a different beast than the first one . oh , sure , it has some of the same characters and is also a spy movie / secret agent film . whereas the first one was so convoluted , you needed a map to follow it , this sequel doesn't suffer from that same deficiency . it's much easier to follow alright . the reason being that they sacrificed story and character for nothing but wall to wall action . now , i'm all for action , but not at the expense of everything else . when this was over , i felt liked i'd been in the Iron Man Triathlon . not only that , but there is next to now believability in this , at least in the stunt dept . the could have made the costumer's job a lot easier by having the characters all wear a red cape and blue underwear . at least there would have been some believability . also , it seems everything in the movie blew up somewhere along the way . i think the script blew up as well . certainly this movie was more exciting than the first one , but there be some balance . i'll give " Mission Impossible 2 a
472841	11423174	852842	8.0	can be purchased on it's own without buying a collection	i don't actually enjoy the show MythBusters , but this episode intrigued me . i thought it would be really interesting to see if some of the things they do in the movies could be plausible or even possible . these guys really do their research and they leave nothing to chance . they try really hard to replicate the conditions as they would be in the movies . it's possible that they may overlook something , but it's not for lack of trying , and nobodie's perfect . anyway i was a bit surprised at some of their results . turns out some of the movie myths could actually happen ( or at least be possible ) like they are portrayed on the big screen . and there are some things that just would not happen , or at least wouldn't be practical . for me , this was a very highly entertaining episode Of Mythbusters . and if you don't particularly like the show itself , you can purchase this particular episode on it own . for me , MythBusters : Mega Movie Myths is an
473488	11423174	113010	8.0	high intensity fun	i fail to see why this movie has such a low rating on this site ( ) . and i also seem to remember critics blasting it . again , i fail to see why . for me , Fair game is an intense , exciting chase movie . so what if it's generic and not that original . to me , it's more about what you do with the material . in this case , the filmmakers made an entertaining movie . it even had some funny one liners . and the stakes in this movie are a bit higher . the bad guys are not your typical bad guys . they're smart and deadly and have no problem killing people . William Baldwin plays Max , a cop who must protect Kate , ( Cindy Crawford ) a high powered attorney who has angered the wrong people . from this point , the movie is basically a high intensity chase down to the wire . William Baldwin does a good job , but that's not surprising . Cindy Crawford , not having acted before , did a fine job as well . she was i think the brunt of the criticism of this movie , and undeservedly . there are many actresses out there who are much worse than she is in this film . unfortunately her acting career ended before it began thanks to unfair critics and movie goers . if i were a filmmaker , i would cast her in a film , but then i saw potential where almost nobody else does . but that just shows how shortsighted people are . for me , Fair Game is easily an
473684	11423174	349710	8.0	surprisingly entertaining	i was surprised about this movie . it was much more entertaining than i though it would be . it also moves along at a good pace . Joaquin Phoenix's character is the main focus of the story , but i think John Travolta steals the show . he has less screen time , but he gives a very credible and commanding performance . Robert Patrick is also in the movie , although he doesn't have a substantial role . still , i thought he was great with the scenes he had . he is one of the most underrated actors out there , in my book . Phoenix does a god job as the main character , bu like i said , this movie is Travolta all the way . anyway , there is one scene in the movie which is a bit of a downer . other than that though , for entertainment value you can't beat his movie . my vote for Ladder 49 is a
472727	11423174	120660	8.0	what if ?	this was a well done movie dealing with big brother , invasion of privacy and conspiracy theory . it poses the question what if the conspiracy theories with government tracking you every movie and knowing all your intimate details were actually true . what if they could erase your life in an instant . Will Smith plays an ordinary joe , who is Caitrin up , through no fault of his own in just that scenario . if you have any paranoia regarding , this sort of thing , this movie will heighten it . i don't think it's completely realistic . some things are added for dramatic affect and to heighten tension and keep the story moving . nevertheless , it is thought provoking . it poses the question what would you do in this situation . it's also very exciting at times . Gene Hackman John Voigt and Lisa Bonet also star . for me , Enemy of the State is a solid
472781	11423174	338188	8.0	echoes of John Ford's The Searchers	this western reminded me a great deal of John Ford's epic western The Searchers , ( 1956 ) both style wise and story wise . this film has some mysticism added in to the mix , which The Searchers does not . this may be blasphemous to some , but i liked The Missing more . The Missing is a fairly deliberately paced movie , with pockets of action here and there . i liked Tommy Lee Jones's character a lot . i found him very interesting . he plays Samuel Jones / Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan . he is the estranged father of Cate Blanchett's character , Maggie . Sam spent a lot of time with the native indians , hence his Indian name . anyway , i really liked the look and style of the film , and the story . you have to have patience to watch it , but it is well worth sitting through to the end
473016	11423174	11130	8.0	the good side vs the dark side	so far , this is the only version of this movie i have seen . it's a silent film starring John Barrymore in the dual roles of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde . the movie does start off slow but picks up quite quickly . once it gets going it is very compelling and engrossing . Barrymore is amazing and pulls of both roles very convincingly . the makeup is amazing , and some of the transformation scenes are very good . the movie is very dark for that time period . it takes the age old struggle between the good side and the dark side and elevates to its extreme . the musical accompaniment is very good and really adds to the tension , and to the the darkness of the film . overall , i liked it and would recommend it .
473301	11423174	95271	8.0	the best of the Michael Myers movies	( this is actually the third Michael Myers film i ) found Halloween 4 : the Return of Michael Myers to be a better movie than the first two Michael Myers movies . i actually felt there were some tense and suspenseful moments in this one , unlike the previous two . i'm not including number three here , because it is a stand alone movie that has nothing to do with the Michael Myers character . the movie also has a much eerier feel to it . i also thought the acting was actually pretty good in this one . in the first two , i didn't think too much of the acting . even though i found the movie to be good overall , the best part for me , was the ending . i thought it was great . maybe predictable , but still great . for , me this movie came closest in the series to delivering the goods for this genre . i didn't find it scary , but like i said , it was tense and suspenseful , and had a great atmosphere . for me , Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers is an
473868	11423174	245046	8.0	very good movie set during the time of the second World War	" Charlotte Gray " takes place during the second World War . Charlotte becomes a courier in France , to help the war effort . but she has her own reasons for joining . being a courier is a dangerous job and most do not survive . the movie , while not depressing , is certainly sad at times . it is quite compelling and well written , and very well acted . Cate Blanchett is an extraordinary actress . it's hard to take your eyes . she is very beautiful , but also talented beyond belief . there are some other great actors in the movie as well . this is one of the better war tome movie out there . i say war time because , although the movie takes place during the second World War , we don't see a lot of the war action . we do , however , get to see its results . for me , " Charlotte Gray " is a very good movie . i give it a strong
473541	11423174	396555	8.0	enjoyable animated family fare from Disney	this film has something for everyone , in my opinion . there's comedy , action , excitement . the movie is also inspirational and uplifting , but without being overbearing . there are also some references to other popular movies . i also thought all the characters were likable , even the bad guy , who isn't really bad . he's more misunderstood and harmless . he's also fairly inept as a villain , in a funny way . his plans are basically a comedy of errors . there's a time travel plot at the core of the movie . and there a few unexpected twists as well . there's a good moral to the movie , which i didn't feel was preachy at all , a refreshing quality for this type of movie . and finally , i liked the music a lot . there are some great songs here , something i find lacking in many movies . for me , Meet The Robinsons is an
472733	11423174	455447	8.0	very well done , suspenseful TV movie	as a made for TV movie , this is actually quite good . the acting , especially by Kristy Swanson is above par . she makes a credible protagonist . the movie has plenty of suspense and is less predictable than most . the story concerns a woman ( Swanson ) who , despite years of therapy is still haunted with nightmares / memories of a traumatic childhood event . it turns out there is a mystery behind it all , and Alexandra must discover the truth before it's too late . there are a few suspects who could be the villain ( along with a few scenarios ) and , though i did eventually figure out the mystery and the villain , it took longer than i thought it would . even so , i wasn't completely sure until almost the end . to me , this is a sign of a good mystery movie . i'd recommend this movie to anyone , who wants a movie with some intelligence behind it . i give " Forbidden Secrets " a strong
472649	11423174	120685	8.0	Roland Emmerich and co . redeem themselves after independence day	i really enjoyed this movie . the filmmakers took an old premise and added a new twist : Godzilla in Manhattan . in this movie , Godzilla looks very realistic . beyond that , however there are some other great positives to this movie . the acting is believable , in part because the writing is much better than it was in independence day , which ironically had some of the same writers . this movie has no maudlin speeches , and things are kept low key here . the monster becomes , as the movie goes along , sympathetic up to a point , and almost humanized , which i thought was a nice touch and worked brilliantly . the motives for its destructive rampage are revealed as something more than just creating mindless carnage . you can feel the pain the creature endures , both physical and emotional . i actually felt sorry for the beast and its inevitable fate . of course the ending was designed as a lead in to the almost certainly inevitable sequel . but given the disappointing box office , a sequel did not happen and likely will not . Roland Emmerich , who also directed Independence Day , redeems himself with this effort . the writers , some of whom also had a hand in Independence Day , also deserve credit for this movie . they got it right this time . it is ironic that movie goers turned out in droves for Independence Day , yet largely ignored Godzilla , which i think is a superior film in every way . go figure .
473884	11423174	268380	8.0	animated hi-jinx and adventure during ( what else ) the ice age	if you have a pulse and can fog up a mirror , you should like this movie . it an animated ( in 3d ) movie that takes place during the ice age . it's a comedy , action , adventure flick that is very fast paced , and a lot of fun for both kids and adults . there are quite a few good laughs in this movie . the voice casting is brilliant . Ray Ramano , Legiuzama , and Dennis Leary , among others provide the voice work . this one of the funnier animated movies in along time . it is rated g , so the whole family can enjoy it . as far as i can tell , there is nothing which should be offensive or unsuitable for children . my advice , gather the family around , pop in the DVD and enjoy .
473622	11423174	95243	8.0	very fine movie " based on " the life of Primate expert Dian Fossey	this movie is based on the life of Dian Fossey and her work with the gorillas in a remote part of Africa . " based on " usually means that some of the content is true and parts of it are fictionalized for dramatic effect . for sure Dian Fossey did work with gorillas in Africa and was instrumental in the increase of their population . some of the details may have been altered , but the gist of the story is true . i thought it was a very entertaining , touching and heartbreaking story . i think Sigourney weaver did a great job as Dian Fossey . she really brought some passion to the character . the movie was also thought provoking and i actually became angry more than a few times about some of the incidents that occurred . i find it rare to become so actively involved with a movie nowadays . for me " Gorillas in the Mist " is at a strong
473250	11423174	111070	8.0	fun for the whole family	i thought his movie was quite good . it's loaded with some great laughs , it's heartwarming , and it's original . Tim Allen is in fine comedic form here , way back in 1994 . this is truly a movie the whole family can enjoy . the jokes are appealing to both kids and adults . my sister and both laughed quite hard more than a few times . the movie moves at a quick pace , so you don't really get to know the characters that well . but for this movie , that's OK . you get all the information you need for the story . it's also nice to see a movie like this that isn't preachy . sure there's a message , but it's subtle , and not the main focus of the film . for me , the Santa Clause is a .
473737	11423174	72251	8.0	quite decent suspense thriller from the 70's	this is a pretty good suspense thriller from the 70s . it's about a group of armed gunmen who take over a subway train and hold the passengers hostage , demanding 1million dollar ransom for their safe return . the film takes place in New York . i really loved some of the accents , and i don't mean that in a bad way . i also found it amusing how some of the characters behaved in the film . for example one of the men most responsible for keeping the trains running , is a complete jerk and cares more about the train than the passengers . also , it was comical to see the mayor of New york bitch and moan about 1 million dollars , saying they didn't have that kind of money . that's absurd . true , a million dollars was more back than , compared to today , but this is New York we're talking about . anyway , i'm about to go off on a tangent , so i better move on . the movie has some suspense and has 1 really thrilling sequence . there's no big explosions or anything like that . this movie is much simpler . there are some big names from that time in the movie , and all have good performances . but i especially liked Walter Matthau . i had never seen him in a dramatic role before . the last movie i saw him in was the comedy " Grumpy OLd Men " ( and it's sequel ) with Jack Lemmon . some people may find this movie slow compared to today , or quaint even , which is probably true , to some degree , but i liked it . For me , " The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three " is an
473017	11423174	76054	8.0	good , wholesome , squeaky clean fun	this movie may be squeaky clean entertainment , but that's not a bad thing . for every teenager who's always who wishes their parents could be in their shoes , and every adult who wishes their teenager could see things from their point of view , this is your movie . minor spoilerteenage Annabelle and her mother get to switch places ( literally ) , or at least bodies , and see how what the other side lives . along the way , there's some comic moments , and revelations . i think the movie is just as relevant today as it was then . society has changed quite a bit since then , it's true , and woman today have different dreams and aspirations , but the basic premise is still relevant . it's certainly interesting to see Jodie Foster as a young teenager over 30 years ago . as for the movie itself , it's funny , fast paced and fun for the whole family . my vote for Freaky Friday is an
472783	11423174	275140	8.0	thought provoking and insightful	while i don't like this entry of the Law and Order franchise as much as Special Victims Unit , i still think it is pretty good . i like it more than the original series . this entry is much more thought provoking than the other two . it's more into the psychology of things , which can be very compelling sometimes . we sort of gain some insight into criminal behaviour , at least from the perspective of the show . the characters are fairly interesting , but not as interesting as SVU . i haven't seen the show for awhile , but from what i have seen , the show doesn't delve too deeply in to the lives of the main characters . it sort of lends and air of mystery to things . when all is said and one , Law and Order : CI is a fairly well written , interesting show . for me , it's an
473858	11423174	91474	8.0	classic action / thriller	" man hunter " was released in 1986 and is a prequel to " the silence of the lambs . it was remade in 2002 , with different actors under the name " red dragon " and while both movies are very good , there are some differences . man hunter is very atmospheric in tone , utilizing music more . it is very stylistic , yet also has substance . the action and drama scenes are well done and lit very effectively . the film is much darker in its mood or tone than red dragon , and very effective in building suspense . the acting is well done , particularly william peterson in one of his earliest performances . i really enjoyed the movie and cared about the characters and became emotionally involved . well done movie . will more than satisfy fans of the genre .
473300	11423174	97474	8.0	almost as good as number 4	call me crazy , but i liked this fourth Michael Myers movie . i liked the way they went with the storyline . the storyline may be predictable , but i still liked it . plus , there are a few tiny little clues suggesting a possible reason why Michal came to be the way he is . found this part intriguing . the movie has an air of mystery about it , as these hints are dropped . it's all very vague and nothing big is revealed here , just some clues as to what may come next . enough to keep you hooked . just like the first movie , i thought the acting was pretty good here , though it does get a bit silly at times . there is some suspense and tension here again , maybe not quite as much as number 4 , but it's there nonetheless . i'm not sure if this measure up to number 4 or not , but i still liked it quite a bit . for me , Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers is still an
472898	11423174	120611	8.0	a very well executed vampire film	Blade is the first in the Blade trilogy ( Blade , Blade2 , Blade : Trinity ) It stars Wesley Snipes in the title role as a human vampire hybrid , who has ( almost ) none of the vampires ' weaknesses and all their strengths . Blade has made it his mission to hunt down and destroy the evil vampires . His one weakness is his thirst for human blood . Blade is aided in his quest by Abraham Whistler , Played by Kris Kristofferson , who has developed a serum to curb Blade's blood lust and to keep his vampire side in check . Stephen Dorrf , plays Deacon Frost , the main baddie and Blade's adversary . Snipes is very convincing as an action hero , he is athletic , charismatic , and the camera loves him . Kristofferson is cast well in the supporting role of Whistler . Dorrf is also very convincing as the villain . he too , is very charismatic . Stephen Norrington directed the film . his previous directing experience was 1995's " Death Machine " . he also directed " The League of Extrordinary Gentleman " ( 2003 ) . his other credit include special effects work on films such as " Hardware , Aliens , and the Exorcist : the Beginning , as well as makeup effects for " Hellraiser : Bloodline " . David S Goyer wrote the script for " Blade " . he previously wrote the script for The crow : City of angels , as well " Blade 2 " and " Blade : Trinity " He also wrote the screenplay and story for Batman Begins , as well as the story for its sequel , 2008's Dark Knight " . anyway , back to " Blade " . the film moves along at a brisk pace , is well directed and well written , with good dialogue . the film is also well photographed , is visually very appealing . the tone of the film is dark , without being oppressive and the music is appropriate . there is a lot of graphic vampire violence ( the film is quite blood soaked at times ) and some language . and obviously there are many action sequences , sometimes over the top , but this is no criticism . it works well with this movie . finally , the special effects are plentiful and generally well done . overall , a very well execute movie in the vampire genre . a strong
473477	11423174	368891	8.0	very enjoyable , thrilling , action flick	National Treaure is the story of Bejamin Gates ( Nicholas Cage ) who has been obsessed with finding the mythical ( but perhaps real ) treasure of the Knights Templar , the greatest fortune mankind has ever known , since he was a child . Along the way , Gates makes an enemy ( Sean bean ) who also wants the treasure for himself ( for purely selfish reasons ) . in a twist , it turns out that Gates must steal The Declaration Of Independence , ( which contains a key clue to the Mystery ) so it does not fall into enemy hands . along for the ride are Diane Kruger , Harvey Keitel , and John Voight . Christopher plummer also appears in the movie . what follows is one intense chase scene after chase in a race against time . National Treasure is basically one long chase movie , but well done . the acting is good , and the characters are convincing . the movie is very enjoyable - - even thrilling , as long as you know what you are expecting . very few dramatic scenes , little character development ( except for the character of Benjamin ) and much of the movie is implausible , even unrealistic , but so what . sometimes you just have to turn your brain off and enjoy .
472642	11423174	475944	8.0	Gothic style supernatural thriller	i like this movie . yeah , it may not be original , but it is action packed with some great visual effects . and i also like the style , kind of Gothic . it's a ghost story of sorts . if you're into supernatural stuff , you might like it . it won't win any awards , but so what . it's a great popcorn flick that doesn't try to be anything else . the acting is decent enough . i'm just glad they didn't use big name actors , which may have taken the focus off the movie and onto themselves . besides this is an ensemble picture , so there shouldn't be any personality or ego clashes . i like the way ti ended . the viewer can sort of draw their own conclusions . anyway , for me , this was a fun , action filled 90 minutes or so . i recommend it .
473076	11423174	116225	8.0	as good as the original , with a few differences	this sequel to " Escape From New York " isn't half bad . it doesn't have the gritty , unpolished look of the original , and it's not as edgy . however , i did find it more humorous , and it's more of an action adventure movie , than pure drama , unlike the the original . the movie had a lighter feel to it . i didn't find it had the same sense of loss and decay . i did find it entertaining , and fairly fast paced , though there were a few mildly ridiculous scenes that felt out of place . i also noticed ( as anyone who watches it will ) that the general plot line was almost a carbon copy of the original , with a few variations in detail . i still liked it , and thought it was as good as the original , though , like i said , if you're expecting a departure from the formula of the first , you won't find it . For me , " Escape From L . A . is an
473311	11423174	43456	8.0	an important movie with a message	though this movie was released in 1951 , it's just as relevant today as it was then . it's about an alien who lands on earth , for reasons unknown at first . it shows the army and people in general panicking and acting stupid without knowing all the facts . but it's really a moral about how stupid humanity is , with our wars , ' our petty squabbles , killing each other , and probably eventually leading to the destruction of the human race . we haven't learned anything since then . in fact , we've become worse . the other ridiculous thing is that if a an alien being or alien beings did travel to earth , from a far planet , they would obviously be technologically advanced , yet , as the movie depicts , we would use our primitive technology to shoot first , and ask questions later . i have no doubt this would be the same in real life , considering how arrogant we are as a race . anyway , i liked the movie , and it's positive message . it doesn't try to utilize special effects that seem would eventually become dated and hokey . in fact , the use of special effects is limited . instead it focuses more on story . it's actually , i think , a very important movie . for me , The day the Earth Stood Still is a solid
473110	11423174	217505	8.0	long , but doesn't feel like it	this is a Martin Scorsese epic , and it certainly has that epic feel . i'm not sure how accurate it is historically , or if things really looked the way they do in the movie . i still liked the look of it . to me , it seems a lot of work went into the whole production and it shows . Daniel Day Lewis is astonishing ( nothing new for him ) . Leonardo DiCaprio was also good . Cameron Diaz was not bad , but she didn't really impress me all that much . her character wasn't as substantial as it could have been . like in many movie , there's a good supporting cast . the movie is brutally violent , which is probably an accurate depiction of that time . it is over two and a half hours long , but it doesn't feel like it . i found myself becoming very quickly and easily involved in the story , a sign of a good movie . i wouldn't call it a masterpiece , but it is a very good movie . for me , Gangs of New York is an
473525	11423174	309377	8.0	compelling and engaging	sure this movie takes awhile to get going , but it does work . there's a bit of a murder ( and more ) mystery to solve , but unlike most formulaic movies of the genre this takes a different approach to things . i found it refreshing actually . this is really a thinking person's movie , and it's nice to have your brain engaged . it's very intelligent , with a good mix of characters . it's not predictable , even though you may think you have it figured out . it has more than one surprising revelation . if you only looking for an action packed , high suspense film , this probably isn't it . i think it's a testament to the strong writing and direction that a slower paced movie such as this succeeds as well as it does . i never found it boring once . you are always given enough to maintain a steady level of interest . and that's all that's needed you guessing and hooked . i won't say this is a masterpiece . i don't think it's that kind of movie . it's low key and character ( as well as story ) driven . an easy

Pacino puts on an acting clinic in this one , which is the main reason this movie works . i always assumed this movie was in the top 250 here , but it turns out it isn't . that's a bit sad and strange , since in my opinion it's a lot better than some of the other movies on the list . Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson wrote the film while Norman Jewison directed it . beside Pacino , there are a lot of other name actors involved , such as Jack Warden , John Forsythe , Christine Lahti , Craig T . Nelson , Jeffrey Tambor , and famous acting teacher Lee Strasberg . anyway , for me , . . . and Justice for All is a
473179	11423174	212985	8.0	Part three in the Hannibal Lecter series ( beautifully stylistic but less substance )	" Hannibal " is directed by Ridley Scott . it takes place after the events in the Silence of the Lambs . Here we have the great Anthony Hopkins reprising his Role as Hannibal Lecter , serial killer and one time psychiatrist . and Jullianne Moore takes over as FBI agent Clarice Starling . in this movie Hannibal comes out of hiding to bait Clarice . The movie starts in Florence Italy , where Lecter has been living in disguise as an art scholar . however events force him back to America . once there , he of course baits agent Starling and he himself becomes the focus of revenge by a former patient who barley escaped being killed by Lecter . Gary Oldman plays the former patient . the movie is very stylish with beautiful photography and scenery , especially in Italy . we are shown the old buildings with their impressive architecture . the movie is very well lit , giving the perfect atmosphere . the movie on the whole focuses more on style than substance and the fact that Lecter comes out of hiding takes away the air of mystery the film could have had . so , the film while beautiful to look at , seems hollow at times and incomplete . it can also be slow and overly dramatic at times , lacking the pace of the previous incarnations . Lecter is also played more for camp in this film , with his witty one liners . he just doesn't seem as frightening here . The acting is very good in the movie , especially by Moore , who inhabits the character of Starling with the same affectations mannerisms and accent as her predecessor , Jodi Foster . despite it's failings , i still enjoyed the movie - more so than " silence " but less so than " RedDragon Or " Manhunter " . i would have to give this movie an , for its beautiful style and the acting of Jullianne Moore .
473905	11423174	804461	8.0	unrated version	this movie is basically Death Wish updated for the year 2007 . there are a few differences , but the overall plot is the same . it's a revenge / drama . action / movie . it's not realistic , but it sure has lots of action , and lots of blood . this a a very violent film throughout . there's also quite a few strong swear words . one thing i did like about the movie was it's unconventional ending . i also liked the acting , particularly by Garret Hedlund , who plays the main bad guy . John Goodman has a small and needless role . he has one ridiculous scene where he goes off on a profanity laced tirade . Kelly Preston has a small role as the wife of Kevin Bacon's character . and Kevin bacon is the main character , who decides to get revenge for a tragedy that occurs against him and his family . but i really liked Aisha Tyler , who has a small but memorable role in the movie . Brian Garfield wrote the novel that is the basis for the movie , and he also wrote the novel Death Wish , so it's no surprise the two movies are very similar . i recently saw The Brave One , another revenge thriller , starring Jodi Foster , which i like more than this movie . i felt it had more depth to it and stronger acting performances . still , i did like Death Sentence . for me , this movie gets an
473723	11423174	100814	8.0	lots of fun	this is quite an entertaining movie . it has lots of elements that work , including action , excitement , danger , fun , and even some comedy . combine that with an intelligent script and good acting , and you have all the ingredients needed for a successful movie . the chemistry between the actors , especially , but not limited to , Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward is one reason this movie works . Bacon and Ward provide much of the laughs . Having Micheal Gross and Reba MaCyntire along for the ride is a masterstroke , as well . the sense of urgency and danger also help . really , there's a lot to like about this picture . for me , Tremors is a strong
472588	11423174	399201	8.0	drama , action suspense . this movie has it all	i enjoyed this movie quite a bit . the 1st half or so is very dramatic , while the 2nd half is action packed and suspenseful . there are a lot chase scenes and things blowing up . the action is frenetic . i also liked the subject matter dealing with clones and the whole ethical / moral ramifications aspect . i thought it was very thought provoking . plus , it was fun . movies like this don't win too many awards , but that is not the intent . and , yes , there may be elements of implausibility , but if you go to the movies to escape the doldrums and routine of ordinary life , then whether something is realistic or not , is not likely a huge concern for you . i know for me , it's not . of course there are always exception . sometimes believability is thrown completely out the window over and over and over , to the point where almost nothing about the movie has any degree of realism . that bothers me . as for " The Island " i think it contained enough realism for this kind of movie . i liked it , and though i wouldn't say it's a masterpiece , i'd give it a strong
473761	11423174	93773	8.0	Arnie at his best	Predator is another classic Arnold Schwarzenegger Movie . Basically the movie is about a group of commandos in the jungle of Central America , who fall victim to a alien warrior . but this is no ordinary warrior . this warrior has great strength and advanced weaponry and is able to blend into his surroundings . One by one the commandos are dispatched , until only , Dutch , played by Arnie , is left . this movie is not for the squeamish . there are some very gory scenes , as the soldiers are killed in gruesome ways . again there are some great action sequences , leading to a the ultimate showdown between Dutch and the " Predator " . there are also some good one liners in the film , as with any Arnie movie . a very entertaining film
472702	11423174	35798	8.0	i thought it was a good western	i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford . it's got pretty much everything a western should have . there's gunfights , action , chases on horseback . there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at . there's some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan , who plays Uncle Willie McLeod , a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool , but is actually aware of everything going on . Randolph Scott plays the town Sheriff , and Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith , a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways . i liked the different mix of characters in the movie . i didn't find it always fast paced , but i never found it boring either . even though the movie is in 1943 , it is in colour .
473010	11423174	24368	8.0	i liked it	this movie is more of a lite comedy , murder mystery than a horror . but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie . in fact , i liked it quite a bit . it's very fast moving , has some eccentric and intriguing characters , and it's comedic . it has a sinister feeling to it , but it's not what i would call horror . there is a little bit of overacting , but that's too be expected in an early sound picture , since peop0le were so used to using their facial expression and body language in silent films . Fay Wray is one of the stars in the movie , but her part is not that large , though her character plays an important role in the film , and does a lot of screaming , which is something Fay Wray is known for . the movie really belongs to Glenda Farrel , whose tough talking , sarcastic reporter steals the show . her character is sort of Nancy Drew like . i found her very likable and appealing . my vote for The Mystery of The wax museum :
473825	11423174	111143	8.0	fun from the get go	i thought his was a great movie all around . Alec Baldwin was a great choice to play the The Shadow / Lamont Cranston . Penelope Ann Miller is also good as his sometimes sidekick Margo Lane . and Peter Boyle is hilarious as Moe Shrevnitz , the Shadow's personal taxi driver . the movie moves along at a good pace and i never found it boring . i'm not sure , but i think it sticks pretty close to its source material . Russel Mulcahy ( Resident Evil : Extinction ) directed the movie . for me , this movie is just all around fun from start to finish . but i also liked the look of the film . i think they put a lot of effort into recreating the 1930's look and atmosphere , and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it wasn't very well received . anyway , for me The Shadow is a strong

473246	11423174	297884	8.0	very well done but should have been rated 14A ( in my opinion )	in this film which takes place in the 1950's , Dennis Quaid and Julianne Moore play your typical happily married couple . and then change . the film is about the intolerance and ignorance of the time , and also the hypocrisy in people's attitudes . Both Moore and Quaid are pitch perfect in their characterizations , and Dennis Haysbert is very good as , well . there are some very touching moments here . this is no film for children . it is rated PG , which i don't happen to agree with . obviously it contains dark themes and implication , so i wouldn't suggest anyone under 14 view it . maybe i'm just becoming a prude in my old age . in any event , the film is very well done , from the acting , to the dialogue , to the authentic feel . for me , Far From heaven is an
473849	11423174	53221	8.0	review of Ultimate Collector's edition	i really like this Western . it stars John Wayne , Ricky Nelson , Dean martin and Angie Dickinson , to name a few . the acting is superb in this movie . but what i really like is the dialogue and the unique mix of characters . the story is also good . it's straightforward and simple . Unlike The Searchers , another John Wayne movie . Rio bravo is not a sweeping , grand epic . it takes place in basically one town . nevertheless , i found it engaging and compelling . this edition contains a raft of extras , including two documentaries and a short featurette . Like the Ultimate edition of The Searchers , here is also a reproduction of the 1959 Dell comic book , a reproduction of the original press book from 1959 , and 8 full colour lobby cards . as for the movie itself , i think it's pretty well done , and deserves a . the collection is definitely worth having , and i give that an .
473493	11423174	107497	8.0	some nice twists and intensity in this one	this is one very good movie . it's got suspense , a twisting plot , great intensity , and a good story . it may not be wholly original , but it think it works , thanks to its three main actors , Alec Baldwin ( The Good Shepherd ) Nicole Kidman ( The Interpreter ) and Bill Pullman . But Kidman really surprised me with the intensity she brought to her role . i'm generally not a fan , but she is effective in this movie . the supporting performances are also good . i also like the fact that the movie isn't completely predictable , like happens in so many movies . the movie is also very well paced . there are no lagging spots to slow things down to the point of boredom . anyway , i really enjoyed it .
472547	11423174	315297	8.0	nice little crime drama / murder mystery	pretty good for the genre . it has suspense , plot twists , a nice creepy , dark atmosphere . it drop some nice tantalizing clues as to who the killer may be . Ashley Judd make a real kick ass heroine . she's certainly credible in he role , as a new homicide inspector with a more than a little baggage . Sam Jackson is great ( once again , as her mentor , as well as the commissioner . Andy Garcia plays her new partner . he was OK , but i didn't really feel he completely fit the movie . there was just something . . . i really liked David Strathairn , as a police shrink . his role wasn't that big , but i thought he was impressive , none the less . i also liked the great Jazz soundtrack . despite all the good things about this movie , i wouldn't call it great . for one thing , it lacks any intense action , it's not really riveting or harrowing . so i wouldn't classify it as a thriller , but more a straight crime drama / murder mystery . i would have preferred it to be a bit more exciting . for me , Twisted is a
472742	11423174	93870	8.0	action packed with humour and irony ( and ultra violent )	i liked this movie quite a bit . it's very well paced , the acting is pretty good and it is ultra violent . it's basically about a part human , part cyborg cop who cleans up the streets of the city . there are some glitches along the way , of course . i think the movie , at its heart is a social satire . it's very relevant , even more so today . there are touches of irony and humour through out . Paul Verhoeven directed it and it's his first Americna movie . Verhoeven doesn't shy away from violence and if that sort of thing bothers you , you'll want to skip this movie . there is another , maybe more futuristic robotic cop , which i really like the look of . ( possible minor spoiler ahead ) there are two showdowns between RoboCop and this other futuristic , more advanced robot , both of which i found exciting and well done . for , me RoboCop is an
473507	11423174	107504	8.0	" Don't make this dog angry - - you wouldn't like him when he's angry "	this movie was better than i thought it would be . i thought it would be good , but it exceeded my expectations . the acting was fairly decent , but there was one standout - - the dog . all the other characters were secondary . this dog was very well trained and had a personality-to boot . intelligent , lovable , sad and even romantic . there is a brief back story to the dog and how it came to be where it was . this is basically a very genetically enhanced animal , with all senses heightened , great strength , speed and intelligence . the story flowed very well and the dog ( whose mane is Max ) soon becomes endearing to the viewer the filmmakers even added a brief touch of whimsy , which i thought was a hint of brilliance . we feel pain when Max feels pain . Because this dog is such a highly developed character , it becomes very easy to sympathize with him . Even when Max slowly evolves from being a lovable " mutt " into a vicious killing machine we still feel for him . and that ' because we are told early on that Max is not completely under his own control , and every second he is away from the " lab " his killing instincts exert themselves until he becomes psychotic . I was very entertained by this film , having also recently seen " Rottweiller " which is fairly similar , containing some-of the same subject matter but it takes a different tact than " Man's Best Friend " I give this movie an / 10
473907	11423174	381971	8.0	terrific family entertainment	this movie was better than i was expecting . it's lite heated , funny and great fun for the whole family . it's also very touching . there nothing in this movie that can't be watched by any age group . kids should lobe it , and it's also engaging enough for adults . i think the story is interesting enough for both kids and adults . it's n9ice to know there is still some quality family entertainment that really is for the whole family . i also thought the voice actors fit the characters perfectly . if you're a parent , you can set your r child down by themselves , knowing they are watching something which is perfectly kid friendly , and you might like it as well . for me Curious George is an
473617	11423174	109402	8.0	high speed romance comedy chase movie with predictable but satisfying ending	" The Chase " is sort of an action adventure romance with some light comedy . it is a case of mistaken identity ( sortof ) . Charlie Sheen and Kristi Swanson play the two leads in the movie . Charlie Sheen is Jackson Davis Hammond , a falsely convicted armed bank robber who escapes from custody . As Jackson makes a quick stop at a gas station to fill up ( in a stolen car ) the report of the stolen car is heard by two police officers in the store . the officers attempt arrest Jackson , and rather than go back to jail , he kidnaps the woman standing next to him in line . This woman just happens to be Natalie Voss , ( Kristi Swanson ) daughter of wealthy industrialist DaltonVoss . ( Ray Wise ) Jackson escapes with Natalie and leads the police on a much publicized car chase , which takes up most of the movie . the ending is predictable but satisfying . Obviously , there is a lot of action , some of it quite intense . there is also humour , courtesy of Sheen and Swanson . much of what occurs in the movie is somewhat improbable but the movie is entertaining and fun .
472792	11423174	87363	8.0	great horror / comedy blend	i liked " Gremlins " a lot . i thought it was well acted and funny . it also had some black humour , which i liked . i liked the look of the gremlins . they would probably be scary for some children . they are quite freaky looking . i thought the puppetry was amazing . for the most part it really looked like these creatures were doing what the movie showed them doing . the gremlins were hysterical at times in what they said and how they acted . this is my idea of a good horror / comedy . it balances both elements well . it think the potential was there for the movie to be really awful , but good writing makes all the difference . the only real complaint i have about the movie , is you could really tell it was all a set , which looked suspiciously like many movie sets of the time . i'm sure they used that particular set for several movies . anyway , this is just a small complaint . and i'm probably being petty . otherwise , i really enjoyed the movie . for me , " Gremlins " is an .
472951	11423174	386907	8.0	professor discovers he is murdered in 5 days ( thanks to an anonymous tip from the future )	i did'nt mind this mini series . for a TV science fiction movie , it's not half bad . it kept me interested through out , and even riveted at times . the acting is very good in this movie . i'm not sure how accurate the movie is from a physics point of view , but so what , i enjoyed it . the basic premise is that physics professor J . T . Neumeyer ( Timothy Hutton ) discovers that he is murdered in 5 days ( thanks to an anonymous tip from the future . so he must try to figure out who the murderer is and try to prevent his own killing thereby altering his destiny and maybe that of others . the whole thing involves theoretical time travel ( sort of ) in the present and in the future . i have to say , the ending caught me completely by surprise . i wasn't expecting it at all . i honestly thought this was a well done mini series . i'd give ' 5 days to Midnite '
473911	11423174	85244	8.0	good	i thought this was a pretty decent drama . it's about a group of former friends who have gone their own ways , and years later are reunited at the funeral of a close friend . it's well acted , for the most part , but there were a few moments which felt a bit contrived . maybe that's just me . the music soundtrack is outstanding with classics from the 60's and 70's . i might have had a higher opinion of this movie , had i not just watched Ordinary People , which was a brilliant movie . The Big Chill , to me , just didn't have quite the same emotional resonance or impact . still , it's a good movie . Lawrence Kasdan directed the movie and co-wrote it with Barbara Benedek . apparently there is remake in the works as well . for me , The Big Chill is an
473399	11423174	111257	8.0	solid action , nail biting tension	before this movie , who knew Keanu Reeves could be a credible action hero ? Reeves impressed me with this effort . he put on a few ponds of muscle for this one . Sandra Bullock is also in this one , and although her character is likable , she just doesn't make the same impression as Reeves does . i guess part of the reason is that her character really isn't the focus , which can't really be blamed on her . Dennis hopper has a nice turn as a sadistic villain . aside from the acting though , there are a lot of good things about this movie . one is the relentless action . this thing really movies . it's also a real nail biter at times . the writing by Graham Yost is also good , as is the direction of Jan de Bont . as far as action movies go , this one is right up there , in my opinion . i give " Speed " a solid
472874	11423174	50976	8.0	Knight challenges " Death " to chess match for his life	this is the first Ingmar Bergman i have seen . Bergman is a very revered Swedish director . i wasn't sure what to expect with this film , but i had wanted to see it for some time . basically the story is about a knight named Antonius Block ( Max von Sydow ) during the time of the Black Plague in Europe . Block finds himself visited by " Death " himself ( Bengt Ekerot ) , who reveals that Block's time is soon up . Bock himself already has suspicions so is not surprised , and in weird way , is resigned to his fate . and yet , to avoid or at least delay the inevitable , he challenges " Death " to a game of chess . if he wins , Death will leave him alone , at least for the time being . of course if he loses , his time is nearly up . as the match unfolds , we are shown various people who struggle to deal with the plague and its devastation , each in their own way . also , during breaks in the game , Block goes on a personal journey , to try to find some meaning in life in general , and in his own life . we see he is a very conflicted , tortured soul and longs to believe ( that is have faith in God ) . the movie is very low key , very dramatic , yet really is compelling . i did not understand every nuance of the movie , not knowing what to look for , and the movie is subtitled in German , which makes it a bit harder to follow . this is mainly due to the fact that the subtitles sometimes omit parts of pertinent conversation . at least , it seems that way . either way , this film demands a 2nd viewing , which should fill in things missed the 1st time . one thing i do know is that Bergman is a very passionate director , and that shows , although ironically in subtle ways . the point is , although the movie is melancholy at times , i did enjoy it . For now , a strong
473223	11423174	35706	8.0	terrific little murder mystery	it may be an old movie , but i liked it . it's a very interesting , well acted murder mystery . the dialogue was quite good , the writing was good and the music adds a real atmosphere of creepiness to the proceedings . there's ' not a lot of action . it's more of a psychological character study . and for me , unt9il near the very end , i wasn't sure who the murderer was . Lon Chaney Jr . is the main star . he plays a neurologist / hypnotist who ends up being accused of his wife's murder . the thing about it is , he can't remember the last couple of days , including the day his wife was killed . at least that's what he says . this is part of the Universal Pictures Inner Sanctum Mysteries movie collection . basically , an anthology series along the lines of Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits . anyway , i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , and if you are a Lon Chaney Jr . fan , you might want to check out not only this movie , but the box set collection ( five other movies ) all starring Chaney . i give Calling Dr . Death a solid
473769	11423174	78767	8.0	good , old school terror	for a few really good scares , this movie works pretty good . it's not fast paced , but it slowly builds tension , while throwing in some real scary sequences . the acting by James Brolin and Margot Kidder is really credible here . They play George and Kathy Luts , who with their children , move into their nightmare , i mean - - dream house . the movie is supposedly based on a true story , though depending on who you believe , the whole thing was fabricated and has been debunked as a hoax . either way , it makes for riveting , disturbing entertainment . i know i got chills down my spine more than a few times . Rod Steiger is also in the movie and is very strong as a concerned and then involved priest . the children are also portrayed very well . there are no cheap scare here . the movie earns every shiver and gasp . for me , The Amityville Horror is an
473644	11423174	27899	8.0	Popeye takes Swee ' Pea to the Zoo	in this animated short , Popeye takes Swee ' Pea to the zoo , and of course chaos and hi jinx ensue , with Popeye being pretty much oblivious . this is the 1st Popeye short i have seen , and i thought it was quite funny , and of course absurd . this is one of the short films from the Fleisher studio , who also did a number of Superman animated shorts , 17 in all , i think . one of the funniest things about Popeye is his strange way of speaking , or mumbling rather . that and the fact that he always has a can of spinach on him no matter where he goes . of course , as soon as the can of spinach is drained , Popeye becomes super strong . in just over 7 minutes , there is a lot packed into this short . i really enjoyed it . for me , Popeye : Little Swee'Pea is an
473341	11423174	276816	8.0	spooky and intelligent	combine some of the tension and suspense of U571 with some good old fashioned horror , and you get an idea of this movie . not hack and slash , slice and dice gore , but horror . there some chilling moments here , with not too much gore . there is a very strong psychological aspect to this movie . some thought was really put into the story . the acting was good , but i think it takes a backseat to the story . the tension , as well as the body count , mounts , with each successive , bizarre , happening . it also keeps you guessing until the end . i found it all worthwhile even satisfying . lately , it seems i've been on a role with horror movies . that's a nice change from a lot of the crap i had been seeing . for me , Below is an 8 maybe not a really strong 8 , but a solid .
473810	11423174	847161	8.0	i liked it	while i can't say whether this adaption of the Dracula myth is true to Bram Stoker's novel , ( since i haven't read it ) i still liked it . i liked the look of Dracula as an old man and as the young man . i also really liked the almost unrecognizable David ( Poirot ) Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing . i don't think i've ever seen an episode of Masterpiece theatre , but i think they did a fine job with the Dracula lore . Marc Warren was good as the count and i could see how the character could be seductive to women . i liked the look of the film . it is certainly beautifully photographed . i think this is the most romanticized version of Dracula i've seen so far . it's just as good as any of the others i have seen . i give this version of " Dracula "
473050	11423174	338526	8.0	one wild ride	i don't understand the low rating for ( ) for this movie on this site . i thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout . the basic Gist of the story is this : Van Helsing take son Count Dracula , The Wolfman , and the Frankenstein Monster in one adventure . what more could you ask for ? this is one fast paced thrill ride , with spectacular action and fight sequences . Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing , and makes the character larger than life . Kate Beckinsale is Anna Valerious , whose family has for centuries tried to rid the world of evil . she teams up with Van Helsing , and the sparks fly . there is no denying the chemistry between the two . i wouldn't call this a scary movie , but it is very intense at times , and a bit morbid . it doesn't take itself seriously though , which works in this case . for me , Van Helsing is an
473108	11423174	408790	8.0	very harrowing , but	i don't think it's realistic . plus , there are a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies , in my mind . but the acting is first rate from all , and it had me guessing to the end . it was unpredictable enough that i wasn't sure who was good or bad , until the end . plus , the ending was different than i thought it would be . and the movie is certainly harrowing and will get your adrenaline pumping . the only problem is , i just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get around all the unanswered questions . normally that isn't an issues for me , but it just becomes too much . despite that , i still give it high mark due to how harrowing and entertaining it is . for me , Flightplan is an . if you can suspend your disbelief enough , you will probably really like this movie .
473642	11423174	55254	8.0	fun for the whole family	i really enjoyed this animated Disney classic . it's just a lot of fun . lots of action and excitement , and an excellent choice for the villain in Cruella Devil . whose is iconic ( or should be ) in my opinion . very young children may be a bit frightened of her , as she certainly is scary looking . her 2 henchman are quite inept , and provide a lot of comic relief . i also really liked the voice acting . i thought it fit well with the characters . the animation is also good , considering it is from 1961 , though i'm sure it took a few years before that to complete . anyway , in my opinion , this classic is good fun for the whole family . my vote for 101 Dalmatians is an
472533	11423174	441796	8.0	too cool ! ! !	wow . i had real negative preconceptions about this movie . i thought it would be like hostel , blood and guts and nothing else . but then i decided what the heck . so i bought it . i was very impressed . there was very little blood and guts . there was however , suspense and atmosphere . there was at least a semblance of a plot , enough so that what little blood and guts there was , was not gratuitous . the music was very appropriate , very moody . i liked the characters and really hoped they would STAY ALIVE . of course naturally people die in a movie like this , but i still rooted for them anyway . these characters were more intelligent than in most horror movies yet most of them still died . there were some inventive kills in this movie , which i really liked . i also liked the fact that the villain is often unseen . this movie also had some " jump out of your seat moments " . the ending was pretty good , but it definitely sets up for a sequel . one other thing this movie has going for it is the character of abigail , played by samaire armstrong . boy is she hot . kind of looks like elishia cuthbert , but maybe hotter . i hope we see her again in movies . there is one other thing about the movie i liked , and that was the cinematography . really well done . forget hostel , this is how horror movies should be made . cool . this comment refers to the unrated DVD version , not the pg 13 version
473871	11423174	286214	8.0	informative and entertaining	this documentary is contained on the bonus disc of the original " Texas Chainsaw Massacre ultimate edition released in 2006 . the documentary was originally produced in 2000 , though i think it has some material added since then . either way , it's a pretty good documentary , with revealing interviews with many of the original cast and crew . it reveals a few surprising things about the production itself , but also about the aftermath . i was surprised at how much money the movie made . keep in mind this is 1974 . as far as documentaries go , this is one of the better ones . many documentaries merely repeat things everybody already knows , but this one has is refreshing , and actually shows new insight into the movie . it's also highly entertaining . at least i think so . i also like that it gives you updates on where the cast and crew are now . all in all , a very good documentary , well worth watching . for me " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " : The Shocking Truth " is an
472535	11423174	182789	8.0	a highly underrated gem	i really liked bicentennial man . i thought the premise was original , the acting was very good . i liked the humour sprinkled throughout . this was certainly a dramatic movie , with no frenetic " in your face action " . as a result the story is more flushed out , as are the characters . the movie was intended to be dramatic and succeeds very well at it . people who watch this movie expecting huge action sequences are missing the point . the basic idea of the story is about an android who discovers he wants to become human and sets out a journey which spans nearly two hundred years to fulfill his quest . i did not find this movie boring at all , but became very drawn in to the story and emotionally attached to the characters . this movie gets a well deserved out of 10
473808	11423174	115963	8.0	think mean girls with an edge ( and multiply that to the nth degree )	i liked this movie . i found it entertaining , creepy and amusing , for all the right reasons . the cast was perfect for this movie . the four main actresses seemed so natural together and really worked well off each other . it's fairly obvious this movie inspired others as well as some TV shows , one in particular . i loved the soundtrack . it just seemed so fitting not just for the movie but for the subject material . i think they the subject matter well , without making it ridiculous and campy . plus , the movie has many relevant issues for that age group ( teenagers in high school ) as well as society in general . it also has a great moral lesson , which i won't give away , but is probably fairly obvious . overall , the movie is a fun and thrilling 90 plus minutes . " The Craft " is easily an from me .
473417	11423174	358135	8.0	Bored lawyer adds spice to his life by secretly taking ballroom dance lessons	this movie is a remake of a Japanese film made in 1996 . i haven't seen the original , so i'll only comment on this , the 2004 version . This movie is about a bored lawyer who has been married for nearly 20 years and had the same job for a long time . he decides to spice up his life and without telling anyone begins taking ball room dance lessons . Richard Gere is John Clark , the bored lawyer . Susan Sarandon is his wife . Jennifer Lopez is the dance instructor who John feels a connection to . Stanley Tucci provides some light comic relief as one of the students . This is a whimsical , light hearted movie . it is enjoyable and there are some good performances . Gere in particular seems to really be having fun with his character during the dance scenes . Lopez , however , comes off a bit stiff and forced at times . Tucci turns in another great supporting performance and is very funny at times . Lisa Ann Walter also provides some laughs with her character Bobby . Richard Jenkins plays a detective named Devine , hired by Clark's wife Beverly ( Susan Sarandon ) who suspects he may be having an affair . Nick Cannon plays Devine's assistant . Susan Sarandon is very good as Beverly Clark , but has a fairly small role in the film . the film is a romantic comedy , emphasis on romantic , but as previously mentioned , does have some comedic elements . the comedy is more of the amusing , chuckling type of laughs . there is nothing which could be called hysterical . if that's what you're looking for , this is not your movie . the movie is fairly predictable , and has the usual feel good ending , but arrives there a bit differently than i expected . Overall , i really enjoyed this movie .
473254	11423174	97825	8.0	excellent , but terrifying	this movie is based on the true story of Richard Ramirez , dubbed The Night Stalker , who terrorised California in the summer of 1985 with a series of brutal crimes . the story focuses mainly on the two main detectives who try to identify and capture him . the movie is a very well done TV movie , but is not only disturbing , but terrifying , all the more so , because it is based on a true story . the movie does a great job of capturing the fear people felt during The Night Stalker's reign of terror . the acting is superb . it would have been nice if the movie had delved into why Ramirez committed those awful crimes , but there is only a vague hint given by Ramirez himself at the end of the movie . for me , Manhunt : Search for the Night Stalker is an .
473610	11423174	416320	8.0	another well crafted effort by Woody Allen	Match Point , written and directed by Woody Allen , is a romantic drama set in London . Jonathon Rys Meyers plays Chris Wilton , a former pro tennis player who tales a job as a tennis instructor at a an upper class club in London . he quickly forms a friendship with Tom Hewitt ( Matthew Goode ) one of his students , who introduces him to his upper crust family , including his sister Chloe . ( Emily Mortimer ) Chris and Chloe soon begin a romance . However , Chris becomes smitten with Tom's fiancé , Nola Rice ( Scarlet Johansson ) . Chris and Nola have a brief affair . Nola moves away and Chris does not see her for a year . However , in a chance meeting , he runs into her again and they begin a prolonged , torrid affair . Chris and Chloe have Married by this time , and Chris has risen quickly in the ranks of his father in law's ( Brian Cox ) company . eventually the time comes when Chris must decide between his wife , Chloe and his mistress Nola . remaining with Chloe assures Chris of the continued extravagant lifestyle he has become accustomed to , while leaving Chloe for Nola would mean losing all the wealth and privilege he has achieved . More complication arise as something unexpected occurs , forcing Chris to make a surprising and life altering decision . this movie is well written , with very good dialogue and interesting characters and dilemmas . Tom Hewitt plays Chris Wilton as charming , suave , and self confident . His seduction of Nola comes across as real and authentic . Nola , played by Scarlett Johansson is woman who knows the effect she has on men and is more than eager to play the game . However , she lacks self confidence as an aspiring actress and is emotionally vulnerable . Johansson is very credible playing a character more mature than her age would suggest . Emily Mortimer , as Chloe , gives a wonderfully understated performance as the neglected wife who has self confidence issues of her own . as the film moves toward its concluding stages , Chris make his decision , leading to a startling and unexpected conclusion . this movie is very well executed and very entertaining , as well thought provoking . a strong
473170	11423174	109279	8.0	great family fare	this is a wonderful movie that is suitable for the whole family . it's very touching and heartwarming . it is a bit sad though and very young kids should be prepared beforehand . there is nothing that should be traumatic though . the story is told from the perspective of Black beauty himself , voiced by Alan Cumming . this is just one of many adaptations of the novel and i have no idea how faithful this particular movie is to the novel by Anna Sewell , but i do know it is a well made movie . there are moments when you may cry tears of joy , and even tears of sadness , but ultimately the movie is uplifting and hopeful . for me , Black Beauty is an
473145	11423174	89175	8.0	entertaining and amusing	as vampire movies go , this one is quite fun and entertaining . it even has some humor mixed in with everything else . sure , it is a bit hokey by today's standards , but it's still a very good movie . there are a few good , and gross transformations and there are some genuinely creepy moments . Chris Sarandon , who plays Jerry Dandridge ( the vampire ) , William Ragsdale as Charley the next Door neighbor and Roddy McDowall , as Peter Vincent , vampire killer and are all really good here . Amanda Bearse , as Amy , Charlie's girlfriend is also good . but for me , it was Ed , Charlie's friend , who i thought provided some great laughs , as did Dorothy Fielding , as Charlie's mother who had a very small part but was nonetheless funny . i also thought Jonathon Stark was very good , as Jerry Dandridge's companion / man servant . i also thought the music for this movie was terrific , adding some style to the proceedings . for me , Fright Night is an
472825	11423174	95963	8.0	great odd couple buddy cop movie ( east vs west )	if you like buddy cop movies , you should like this one . the film stars Arnie as strait laced , no nonsense Moscow detective Captain Ivan Danko , who must team up with loose cannon , goof ball , undisciplined Chicago cop Sgt . Art Ridzik ( James Belushi ) . i won't give away why they have to team up . i'll let you watch the movie to find out yourself . these two are about as mismatched a pair as possible . the movie is ripe with misunderstandings and comedic moments owing to the different tactics each employ on the case . Belushi and Arnie work great off each other . this is really a fun movie . in my mind , it's better than that other buddy movie " 48 Hours " which pairs up Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy . if you like that movie , i can't see how you would not like " Red Heat " . one of the elements that make this film work is the fact it takes place in 1988 , where the political climate between Russia and the U . S was much different than today . anyway , for me , " this movie is funny , action packed and all around entertaining . i give " Red Heat "
473213	11423174	197924	8.0	as good as part 2	Treat Williams returns as the " Substitute " . this time , mercenary Carl Tomassonfullfils a wish from his dead friend and fellow mercenary . he has promised to find his friend's daughter and give her a something he father wanted her to have . he tracks her down at university where she is a teacher . however , when she is viciously attacked and hospitalized , Carltakes it upon himself to find answers , so he becomes her substitute . there is another subplot to the movie , but i won't reveal it here . lets just say , there is tons of action , and some great fight scenes , just like the 2nd 0ne . i liked this movie as much as the 2nd one , mainly because of the action . it's almost the same movie as far as the general plot , but again , some details have been changed . nevertheless , i still enjoyed it . if you liked " the Substitute 2 " you will probably like part3 . just as i gave part 2 , i also give " The Substitute 3 "
473484	11423174	463944	8.0	very good morality tale	i liked this movie . it's a movie about football , but it's much more than that . it's really about honor , truth , and loyalty . it is set in 1950 , and chronicles the " Army " - the West Point football team . West point is the very esteemed military academy . as the movie begins , " army is coming off of 27 consecutive wins and hope to win the championship once again . along the way , many on the team will go through some trials that will test their morality and pledge to uphold the principle of honor at any cost . the backdrop to the story is the Korean War . i like the fact the the story has some depth to it . the very fine performances go along way in anchoring the story . Scott Glenn gives a nice understated , quietly intense performance as one of of the coaches . even though this is a morality tale , it doesn't hit you over the head , or preach to you . all in all a pretty good movie . for me " Code Breakers " is an
473105	11423174	27996	8.0	you never really know who your friends are	this movie is all about being true to yourself and sticking to your convictions . Gary Cooper is Longfellow Deeds , a simple , small town humble man who inherits a large fortune of 20 millions dollars . soon , everybody wants money from him and many people try to change him . this movie succeeds for a number of reasons , one of which is the appeal of star Cooper . he's just so likable , you can't help but empathize with the character . but the message of the film also helps a great deal . it's not preachy at all , and it's very relevant . even more so today . it's nice to see a movie that has a moral centre to it . there's also some humorous and romantic moments that work well . the supporting cast is also effective .
473014	11423174	28010	8.0	funny with witty dialogue	this screwball comedy starring William Powell and Carole Lombard was really enjoyable on all levels . Lombard is always great to watch , and has great comedic timing and skills . i haven't seen too much of Powell , although i think he starred in the Thin Man mysteries of the 30's . he was very good in this film , . the supporting actors are are good . this movie shows that family dysfunction does not discriminate against class or status . the movie also touches on social issues of the day , ( the 1930's ) which it handles very deftly . there are some touching moments between the comedy and drama , which are also played well . i like the witty and snappy dialogue as well . the ending is a bit different than i though it would be , though not in a bad way . for me , My Man Godfrey is an
473392	11423174	1045312	8.0	Attack of The Lizard	this is a 70 minute feature from season one of The Spectacular Spiderman , A new animated series , focusing on the younger years of Spiderman / Peter Parker . in this one , he's 16 years old and in high school . i'm not sure if this is an episode of the series or a standalone feature , i can't find an accurate listing for it anywhere . it may be actually under another title but on the cover it's called : Attack of the Lizard . anyway , i did like it , regardless . it presents Peter Parker as very cheeky and smart-alecy , also fairly immature and somewhat selfish , in that he craves recognition for his heroic as Spiderman , yet he knows this isn't possible . there is lot s of action here , butSpoilerthe Lizard does not even appear until the last 15 or so minutes . still , this is the best looking Lizard of any of the animated Spiderman series so far . by that , i mean the physicality and ferocity of the character . he is very impressive , very strong and deadly . and there is a good battle scene between him and Spidey . other well known villains also appear , but i won't give away which ones . i give this animated episode / feature a good
472695	11423174	102724	8.0	very entertaining and engrossing	i enjoyed this movie a lot . i thought it was well made . it gives a good amount of insight into why Norman Bates became the killer that he was . we are given just the right amount of detail on his past , and not so much that the film gets bogged down in the details . the movie is also tense and suspenseful . there are also some great performances all around , but i was particularly impressed with Olivia Hussey , who plays young Norman's mother . Henry Thomas is also good as young Norman . as far as i recall this movie is less graphic than the sequels , but it is still pretty violent . there is also lots of sexual innuendo . overall , i found this movie very engrossing and compelling . For me , Psycho IV : The Beginning is a strong
473357	11423174	97889	8.0	countdown to extinction	this thriller starts out slow , but after about 30 min picks up steam very quickly . once it gets going , it is a fast paced , tightly wound nail biter . the basic premise is that a a man ( Anthony Edwards ) picks up a ringing payphone and hears something startling , to say the least . according to the caller , the countdown to nuclear war and the end of the world has begun . in less than 90 minutes , every man , woman and child will be extinct . the film then follows Harry Washello ( Edwards ) as he tries to convince others of the threat . and then things get even tenser . without giving any thing away , lets just say this movie reinforces the notion of mob mentality and human ignorance in the face of possible extinction , or even just in the case of horrible tragedy . this view is very accurate , as witnessed by the actions of some of the waste of skin sht heads in new Orleans last year after the hurricane . not all people act that way , in fact most of us are probably decent people who would react like someone with a brain should . but the fact that any do means that among us civilized beings , there are some knuckle dragging sh-t for brain retards sucking up our air , and taking up our space . those animals should be put onto a deserted island , where they can hopefully fight amongst themselves and end up killing each other . anyway , the movie clearly illustrates the point in one powerful scene . it also provokes the question-what would you do if you knew the end was near ? terrific , thoughtful thriller .
473490	11423174	910865	8.0	the best of the four Marvel Animated features so far	i liked this movie much more than i thought i would . it starts off slow , but somewhere along the line , it becomes interesting . i'm not sure how faithful it is to the comic book . either way , i thought it was pretty good . the voice talent fit the characters perfectly . the animation is excellent . the action scenes are very well done . i also thought the back-story was really good and nicely developed , as was the character of Dr . Strange . the people behind this film put a lot of effort into it . of the four animated movies made by Marvel ( the other ones being The Invincible iron man , and Ultimate Avengers 1 and 2 ) , i think this is the best one so far . it is also the one i had the lowest hopes for going in . it is much darker in tone than the previous animated marvel films , but that is definitely appropriate for the subject matter . for me , Doctor Strange is an .

Escalante ( Olmos ) is the man who will change all that . but unlike many similar movies of the genre , he does it gently with subtlety and humour . this is a very inspiring movie , without being maudlin or preachy . i liked it quite a bit . i will say though , that it is not fast paced , by any means . but , if you have patience , you will be rewarded . for me , Stand and Deliver is an
473342	11423174	286306	8.0	clever little gem combining the horrors of with with the horror genre	there aren't a lot of movies set during World War I ( that i know of , though i could be wrong ) and there are probably even fewer combining that subject with the horror genre . but it really works , for this movie . combining the the horror of war with a different type of horror is quite clever . the movie certainly has the atmosphere of dread and doom down . it's not overly gory , but there are a few grisly moments , and some very disturbing images . you never really know what's going on , or what might happen next . i really like the fact that there was actually some intelligent thought process involved in the making of this movie . it wasn't just random , slice and dice gore fest . finally , i thought the acting was outstanding . overall , i found the whole experience quite satisfying . for me , Deathwatch gets a strong
473244	11423174	113497	8.0	once it gets going it's pretty darn fun	i have t say , this movie started out pretty slow , and i thought it was gonna be a dud . i'm glad i kept watching . it turned into a pretty good movie . if you're into action and adventure , you'll certainly find it in abundance here . there are some great action sequences , providing scads of excitement . but there are also a lot of very funny moments , and there's even a hint or 2 of romance . there are some fantastic creatures here . the only downside i can think of is the visual effects . i found them kinda cheesy , and sometimes they didn't quite look real . the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky , but other times were pretty realistic . but that's a small downside , since the movie is so much fun . Robin Williams is the featured performer here , but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific . Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well . but David Alan Grier was a riot . Kirsten Dunst was good too . overall , this is a good movie for both kids and adults . for me , Jumani is a
473526	11423174	210616	8.0	high energy fun	i quite enjoyed this movie . it follows a group of people as they try to make it as as dancers with a prestigious ballet company . as soon as i saw it was about ballet , i groaned inwardly . i thought there's no way this could be anything other than boring . but i was proved wrong very quickly . this movie is not just about ballet . there's more going on . lets just say this is a very high energy movie , with some great dance sequences . if you don't like ballet , i feel very confident in saying that won't matter in this case . for one thing the performances are all very good , both the dancing and the acting . and the movie is choreographed very well . not to mention the great soundtrack . for me , this is a really good 115 minutes .
472944	11423174	429573	8.0	a creepy ghost story based ( maybe ) on true events	An American Haunting is a very well made film . it boasts solid acting , good dialogue and is well paced . it also has some good special effects . there is also a very haunting musical score which elevates this movie . beyond that though this is a creepy film . there is one sequence in particular which made my blood run cold . overall , though , i wouldn't call it terrifying , but it make you uneasy . the movie presents a twist toward the latter half which carries over into the final scene . An American Haunting has the tag-line based on true events , and again what that means is anyone's guess . if you want a film that will give you the creeps , check this one out .
473028	11423174	1164621	8.0	my introduction into the genre of short films	i haven't seen very many short films . in fact , i think this may be the only one i've seen but i liked this one . i could really relate to the man , as i have been in similar situations . i liked the voice over from the two characters . this doesn't always work , but i found it effective here . it gives us a glimpse into the characters . obviously , you won't have a lot of character development in 2 . 5 minutes , but like i said , the voice over helps . it also conveys the humorous aspect quite well . i also like the camera work . as for the ending , i thought it was OK . maybe it could have been expanded a bit , but i think it works the way it is . i think this is a very good short film and also a good introduction to the genre for me . i give Nightwalking an
473733	11423174	397078	8.0	what happens when the luckiest woman and the unluckiest man kiss ?	this is a funny movie , very funny at times . it's about a woman ( Lindsay Lohan ) who has everything . perfect job , perfect apt , perfect life , or so it seems . Ashley ( Lohan ) i s gifted with good luck . everything seems to go her way . then , after kissing Jake ( Chris Pine ) , someone she meets at a masquerade party , her luck changes . . . for the worse . it just so happens that Jake had been cursed with the worst luck in the world . everything bad that could happen to him , did . the kiss has transferred all of Ashley's good luck to Jake and , and Jake's bad luck to Ashley . what follows is a very funny movie . the ending is predictable . actually most of the movie is predictable , but it's funny enough that it doesn't matter . i think the basic premise is unique . it's sort of a variation on the body / personality switching genre of movie . i guess you would call it a chick flick / romantics comedy . either way , it works for me . i should also mention the music . i thought it was very fun and infectious . the movie has a " feel good " tone about , but i don't think it overdoes it . i think it's just the right amount . basically , i liked " Just My Luck " quite a bit . i give it a strong
473005	11423174	454970	8.0	i really liked it	this movie was way better than i thought it would be . i had very low expectations , but i was pleasantly surprised . it had some story development to it . once it gets going , it continually builds suspense and tension , and even gets exciting . there is also a definite atmosphere of panic and fear in the movie and the characters . when we find out what's in store for our characters , it's not quite what you think . there is a bit of graphic violence and gore , but nothing gratuitous . the trailers for the movie are bit misleading and do not do it justice . they make the movie out to be similar to Hostel , when it is much different and a much better movie . i found Hostel to be nothing but blood and guts just for the sake of blood and guts . it served no purpose . With Turistas , the violence and gore served the story . for me , Turistas is an
473574	11423174	397101	8.0	old fashioned ghost story with some surprising twists	this is a pretty good , old fashioned style ghost story . it's genuinely creepy and eerie , with great performances all round . Kate Hudson is in this one , along with the great Gena Rowlands , John Hurt and Peter Sarsgaard . it basically involves an old house on a plantation , a woman who answers an ad to look after an elderly woman's frail , stroke affected husband in said house and some deep dark secrets . throw in some mysticism and some " guests " and you have the ingredients for a real chiller . if you're into ghosts stories with a twist , this might be your movie . there's couple of twists , and some of them are unexpected . this isn't a real action packed movie ( though there is a bit of that here ) it's more psychological , but just as entertaining . i don't think you could go wrong with this movie . for me , " The Skeleton Key " is a strong
472957	11423174	83296	8.0	a very " smart " horror movie	i really enjoyed this movie . the pace is frantic at times ( in a good way ) there's lots of suspense . the villain is definitely menacing , to say the least . even better is the fact that this movie contains no stoned or drunk , easy target teenagers . the victims are all adults and the killer is not just some faceless murdering machine . he has a personality ( not a good personality , but at least he has 1 ) the other thing i liked is that we are shown some insight into why this particular psycho kills women . this is a Canadian movie , which may surprise some people , given how good the movie is . William Shatner is in this movie , but thankfully his role is small enough not to torpedo the movie . others in the movie include Michael Ironside , Lee Grant and Linda purl . 1 other thing i should say is that " Visiting Hours " is a " smart " horror flick . easily / 10
472602	11423174	92007	8.0	great fun ( not your conventional StarTrek movie )	i enjoyed this installment of the Star Trek franchise quite a bit . in my opinion , it's better than the previous ones . i think they did a very good job here , balancing many different elements . there is certainly the action / adventure element here but there is also so quite a bit of humour . the writing is very intelligent and witty . there is also the element of danger , which is very real in this one . the threat is very grave and imminent . the suspense factor is high here too . the story itself is very well written and well paced . this is almost a comedy at its heart . the dialogue is very sharp and fresh . it's more of a family movie than the previous ones . there is some mild language , but it is not used maliciously . it does actually serve the story . the movie is also a cautionary tale i think , to humanity . i think it's just as relevant today as it was then , maybe more so . generally , this movie is probably the most fun of the original Star Trek movies , in terms of comedic value . i also think it is probably the best of the original movies . for me , Star Trek 4 : The Voyage Home is a definite .
473289	11423174	117894	8.0	a Stephen King novel that actually translates well to the screen . yay !	as far as Stephen King adaptations go , this is one of the better ones . the story is very creative and inventive . it's dark and mysterious and very creepy . i wouldn't call it scary , but i could see how some people might think it is . there's a lot of mysticism in this one . it's a real morality fable . it basically shows that everything you do , good or bad , comes back to you . in this case , it's bad , very bad evil , in fact . even though an innocent act is to blame for a deadly occurrence that act comes back to haunt the characters involved , in spades . the innocent act which starts the chain of events is actually very amusing . anyway , i really liked this movie . for some inexplicable reason the story translates well to the screen . don't ask me why . have no idea . but the thing is , it works . For me , " Thinner " is a strong
472540	11423174	266915	8.0	funnier and more action packed than the first one	i found this movie to be better than the first one . there's still lots of action , but it's even funnier than the first . there's some really good fight scenes , and Jackie Chan's moves are even more outrageous this time around . the banter between Chan and Tucker is much funnier and more natural . once again , although there is some violence it's not excessive or gratuitous . i think there is also less coarse language than the first , and like the first , there is no nudity , but there is a bit of suggestiveness . overall , i though this movie was a great ride from start to finish . it's even faster paced than the original , and Tucker and Chan have even better general and comedic chemistry . for me , Rush Hour 2 is an
472775	11423174	115759	8.0	exhilarating action from John Woo	a madman has stolen two nuclear warheads and threatens to detonate them over a populated area if his demand for money is not met . that's the gist of the story . it stars John Travolta , Christian Slater , Samantha Mathis and Delroy Lindo , to name a few . it's a pulse pounding thriller from John Woo ( mission Impossible 2 ) . there's obviously a lot of action , and suspense , and the movie goes right down to the wire . John Travolta is good , as is Christian Slater , but i really liked Samantha Mathis , who i feel is and underrated actress . the action scenes are are exhilarating , though admittedly over the top . but for thrills , you can't beat it . for me , Broken Arrow is an
472671	11423174	71771	8.0	comedy , drama , and action	Burt Reynolds Plays Paul Crewe , a former pro quarterback , whose life takes a turn for the worse as he find himself in jail . The warden ( Eddie Albert ) has a sadistic mean streak . he petitions Crewe to form a football team from the inmates to play against the guards ( a semi pro team ) in four weeks as a warm up match before the semi pro season begins . the warden assumes an easy brutal victory against the inmates . But Crewe and his ragtag bunch have other ideas . this movie has everything , lots of one liners , some very funny situations . even some drama , and action . oh , yeah , there's football too . i would classify this movie as as dramedy , a drama / comedy hybrid , with some action . i laughed quite a bit . the football scenes , especially the hits , are very authentic and there is a lot of violence , though nothing very graphic . overall , the Longest Yard is a very good movie , that is more than a football movie . even if you don't like football , you should still enjoy this film . a strong
473165	11423174	372183	8.0	almost as good as the first Bourne film ( The Bourne Identity )	while not quite as good as The Bourne Identity , this is still a great movie . Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne , and is outstanding . Franka Potente returns , as well , and puts in a good performance . again , we have a strong supporting cast . like " Identity " this one has a lot of action , which is spectacular . the fight scenes are once again superb . again there's lots of tension and suspense , and twists and turns . the only real drawback i found to this movie , is that the dramatic scenes don't seem as compelling , and they seem to go on a bit too long sometimes . other than that , it's pretty much as good as as " Identity " . for me " The Bourne Supremacy " is an
472894	11423174	383574	8.0	less hype , much better movie than the first one	i must say , i quite enjoyed this movie , i think mostly because my expectations were very low . this is due to the fact that i was disappointed in the first installment , because my expectations were too high . how ironic . this entry had more action , better action sequences and more humour . it was at times also darker than the original and the acting had more depth . there were also more characters and various sub plots , but the movie was still easy to follow . the one thing that irritated me at first was that they made captain Jack Sparrow's character even gayer than the first . Johnny Depp does somehow pull it off , though , give him credit for that . so this was only a temporary annoyance and then the character'quirks , or foibles , if you will , grew on me . i don't perceive being annoyed by this in the next installment . this movie also had some more suspense and the action sequences were at times very intense , in a good way . there was an abundance of cgi in this movie , which was exceptionally well done , the best i have seen in a long time , possibly ever . the filmmakers did a great job of balancing humour suspense , action and some darker material together . the story also had more depth and i cared more for the characters this time around . i think most of the characters were better written , for whatever reason . the only other complaint i have is that the movie was a bit too long . i did however like the ending . nothing fancy , just a low key setup for the third installment . basically , this is a case of the sequel surpassing the original in every way . i can't wait for the third entry , though i have higher hopes and it has a lot to live up to 7 . 5 + / 10
473139	11423174	79116	8.0	not action packed , but worth watching to the end	this movie is the story of the one and only documented case of any prisoners escaping from the infamous prison . three men , apparently did the impossible , although they were never heard from or seen again , so how successful they were is anyone's . guess . Clint Eastwood heads up the cast as the mastermind behind the escape , while Patrick McGoohan portrays the warden . though i did enjoy this movie , it's not exactly fast paced , so you really need patience to watch it . but , i didn't think it was boring , and it it ultimately worth it in the end . Don Siegel ( who also worked with Eastwood on several of his Westerns ) directed the movie . if you are a Clint Eastwood fan or Don Siegel fan , you might like this movie .
472856	11423174	107818	8.0	pleasant surprise ( )	i figured this would be good movie , given that it stars Denzel Washington , two acting greats . but given its subject matter ( homosexuality , and AIDS discrimination ) i thought it would also be depressing . in fact , it isn't at all . there are some sombre moments , to be sure . it is very touching at times . i liked how the film doesn't take side on this issue . it merely present a story , and it's up to the viewer how they respond to it . i mentioned Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks . however , Mary Steenburgen also impressed me a lot . Antonia Banderas was also good in what i believe is his first English speaking role . the reasons this film is so good ( in no particular order ) are three fold . one-the acting . 2-the confident direction of Johnathon ( silence of the Lambs ) Demme . 3-the economical writing . i also have to mention the musical score as well as the theme song by Bruce Springsteen . both really complemented the movie well . overall , this was a good movie . one thing i didn't like is that one or two scenes went on a bit too long . however , those were few and far between . my vote for Philadelphia is a
473062	11423174	934935	8.0	the documentary that inspired the movie We are Marshall	i thought this was a good documentary . it was well done all around . i liked the fax that the filmmakers interviewed interesting people that were relevant to the event depicted in the documentary . i've found that that isn't always the case . the documentary is basically about the 1970 Marshall College Football team , almost all of who perished in a plane crash on their way back home . as well as the team , the coaching staff and several community leaders also lost their lives . the documentary also gives some background in to the team before the crash . it shows how the town lived and breathed the team . and of course it details the aftermath of the crash and the effect it had on those who , for whatever reason , were not on board the plane that fateful day as well as family members and friends left behind . these people are interviewed , and you can tell the impact the tragedy had and still does to this day . the documentary is very touching , without being maudlin , and is done in a way that is not horribly depressing . it is sad for sure and tragic , but the filmmakers also focus on the good that came from the tragedy . , which i will leave up to you to watch . . also , they talk about the team today . overall , a fascinating documentary which inspired the movie We are Marshall . anyway , i hope people read this comment and check the documentary out .
473177	11423174	341334	8.0	fast paced , but doesn't seem like it till it's over	this is the complete pilot episode for the TV show of the same name . it's surprisingly very entertaining . it's from the novel by Stephen King , and directed by Robert Lieberman . it's very tautly directed and well acted , especially by Anthony Michael Hall , who is the lead character . i liked his character a lot . he was sympathetic and likable . this is one of the better Stephen King adaptations . it isn't necessarily original , but i liked what they did with the material . it doesn't seem fast paced while you're watching it , but it's over before you know it . it is only 87 minutes , but it doesn't feel incomplete at all . the ending is ambiguous , but obviously there are more episodes in the series . for me , The Dead Zone is an
473242	11423174	406375	8.0	Jumanji in space	from the same world as Jumanji , Zathura is exciting and thrilling . it gets going fairly quickly and doesn't let up until the end . there is not as much comedy in this one , but i think it's more exciting . the special effects are much better here . of course this movie is a decade older , so that makes sense . Kristen Stewart is barely in the movie and Tim Robbins has what amounts to a cameo . Dax Shepherd is quite entertaining here . there are lot of plot holes here , for sure , but once you get caught up in the story , that probably won't matter . this is a movie the whole family can enjoy , although there are a few mild sear words . for me , Zathura is an
472916	11423174	81376	8.0	great harmless fun	i really liked this spoof of Sherlock Holmes , starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway . Knotts is Inpector Winship and Conway is Dr . Tart . Winship is a variation of the Holmes character , but dumber . tart is a variation of Watson , but also dumber . the story is that Winship and Tart are dispatched by Scotland yard to investigate the death of a British aristocrat and his wife . the kicker is , both are American . it's funny seeing two Americans detectives working for Scotland Yard . Winship dresses just like Holmes and Tart dresses just like Watson . both are inept and clueless , and have caused no shortage of chaos and trouble in the states . apparently they are put on the case as punishment or to keep them from trouble , as they are an embarrassment to their superiors . as part of their investigation , they end up at the huge mansion of the aristocrat , questioning the large staff contingent ( who are also very quirky ) , and bumbling from one false clue to the next . from the opening scene slapstick is the order of the day , and there is a lot of it . the characters are so dimwitted and the situations so absurd , it's hard not to laugh out loud frequently . i really had a blast . it's not high art , but it is entertaining .
473576	11423174	278435	8.0	good writing , good intensity and a real sense of peril	this movie deals with the same theme as " sleeping With the Enemy " which came out over a decade earlier . the theme is spousal abuse . as in " Enemy " a woman ( Jennifer Lopez ) meets the man of her dreams , ( Bill Campbell ) only to find out he's actually the man of her nightmares . so she runs away , only to be tracked relentlessly at every turn by psycho husband who has no qualms about killing her . faced with no other options , she learns to protect herself and decides to confront him . this element added a bit of originality to the film . daughter , fathered by her psycho husband Mitch ( Campbell ) and has to protect her as well . i liked this movie more than " Sleeping With the Enemy " mainly because of the added element of a child to protect and that the abused wife decides to physically confront her abuser . their's obviously more action , but i also think the writing is very good . you can feel the intensity and the peril that Slim is in . the only knock i have against this movie is that at times it strays into unreality territory . other than that , i liked it . my vote for " Enough " is
473348	11423174	259324	8.0	Ghost Rider makes the leap from comic book to screen	as far as comic book adaptations go , this is not a bad movie , i can't say how accurate it is to its source material , but i didn't mind it . it's basically about a young motorcycle stuntman named Johnny Blaze . as a young man . johnny is tricked into selling his soul to the devil for reasons revealed in the movie . years later , the devil calls upon his services as " Ghost Rider " a flame skulled entity from the dark side who is basically the devil's bounty hunter . i liked this movie quite a bit , although it seemed a bit rushed . i think they could have fleshed it out a bit more . but to be fair , there is some voice over narration in the film , which does provide an overview of the whole Ghost Rider Legend . if you're a fan of the comic , you probably know all you need to know . Nic Cage , as the older Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider is well cast . he seems to suit the role well and is believable ( in the context of the movie ) . i like the music . it went well with the movie . there is a lot of action in the movie and some cgi , which is well done , but not groundbreaking or anything . ( although Ghost Rider's flaming skull was kinda cool ) The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the love interest , but her screen time is far too short . her character should have had more to do . she is very charismatic , so the scenes she was in left me wanting more . oh , well , hopefully her character will play a larger role in the sequel . as for the movie itself , my friend and i had free passes , so i can't really complain . it is a fun movie to watch , but doesn't linger long after viewing . i will go see the sequel when it comes out , as i believe it will probably improve on this one .
473182	11423174	331468	8.0	very suspenseful , psychological thriller	this movie is about a family that moves into what they believe will be their dream home . it is old and falling apart , but they believe that once they fix it up , it will be the home they've always wanted . sounds alright so far . however , they notice something strange . when they move in the house is filled with possessions of the previous owners . then weird thongs begin to happen . they discover the house holds a dark secret . and someone else decides the house belongs to them . Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid play Cooper and Leah Tilson , the proud new owners . Stephen Dorrf is also in the film as is Juliette Lewis . The film is directed by Mike Figgis . it is a psychological suspense thriller , with out a lot of gore and graphic violence . a rare treat in these days of slice'em dice'em , hack and slash movies . this movie has a very eerie atmosphere throughout and works well as a ghost story . if you want some genuine chills , i recommend " Cold Creek Manor "
473238	11423174	74860	8.0	pretty good political thriller . ( )	this is a pretty good political thriller . aside from a few slow moments , it's well paced . it's very intense and suspenseful . i did find it a bit predictable , but that's a minor quibble with this film . Dustin Hoffman stars as a college student who unwittingly becomes caught up in political intrigue and danger . Laurence Oliver stars as well in a chilling villainous performance . William Devane co stars . but i really liked the Swiss actress Marthe Keller . she was very good here in my opinion . you may not think the title The Marathon Man means much but it actually ties in well with the movie . in any event , this is a taught well made thriller . for me , The marathon Man is a
473583	11423174	29606	8.0	what price , fame ?	this is the first version of this movie made , and the only version i have seen so far . i liked it . i thought it was touching and ironic , and also tragic . it basically tells what the movie business can do to you , and the sacrifices that are made . it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are . as long as you are the flavour of the week , everything seems fine . but when you're no longer useful , reality hits and things can come crashing down . that's what basically happens in this story . it's an indictment ( ironically ) of the movie industry , however subtle . regardless , i thought it was well done . the acting by the tow leads , Janet Gaynor , and Frederic March , as well as the supporting performances , are terrific . i also thought the writing was very good , and the movie flows very well . for me , A Star is Born gets an
472857	11423174	443701	8.0	it's a mystery to me	i finally got around to watching this second X Files movie . i didn't know what to expect , since i hadn't paid any attention to any of the news or hype surrounding it . however , i really liked . i thought it was better than the first X Files movie Fight the Future . whereas that movie focused on the alien / government conspiracy storyline from the TV series . this new movie has very little to do with the paranormal aspect . there is a little of that , but it's a small part of the story . this is a standalone movie which in my my mind works . it's much deeper in terms of storyline . i wouldn't call it a horror movie , but there are some horrific scenes in it . as far as action goes , there not a lot of it . this is more a story and character driven piece . there's a lot of suspense . at first glance , the movie may seem to move very slow , but that deliberate pacing really works in this movies favour . i also thought having Amanda Peet in the cast was a real plus . if you're an X Files purist , you probably won't like this movie . otherwise , though , i encourage you to check it out . a solid
473279	11423174	81207	8.0	teenager is picked on by school bully , hires outcast as bodyguard	my bodyguard is a great family movie , with minimal violence ( even then the violence is a necessary part of the movie ) . there is no foul language that i know of . the fight scenes are done very tastefully . there is bit of humour thrown in as well , mostly in the form of ruth gordon ( grandma ) . the subject matter ( bullying ) is still very relevant today although the movie takes a lighter approach than any movie made today would . it is also simplistic in its approach , though being a family oriented movie , one would expect it to be . the movie does go abit overboard on the inspirational factor and it paints bullying as something much easier to deal with than the reality . watching this film as an adult , it seemed like it could have had more substance . as a child , i remember enjoying it thoroughly . i like to think of it as a low rent " karate kid " even though karate kid was still five years away . my bodyguard will be enjoyed by early teens and a bit younger . parents will enjoy the fact that their kids have a kid friendly movie to watch . 8 stars for kids , 6 stars for adults
472885	11423174	519656	8.0	continuing the story The The Rubberface of Comedy	this episode is a continuation of the previous episode The Rubberface of Comedy , which i really enjoyed . this is the last episode of season 1 . i liked this episode as well as the previous . i like where they took the story . i hadn't seen a full episode of this series until i watched the previous episode . after having watched this episode and the previous one , i noticed that there is more depth to the character of Bruce Wayne . the series seems to touch more on the personal life and tragic aspect that id the Batman / Bruce Wayne . of course , i've now only seen 2 episodes , and maybe it's just my imagination . either way , this story contained in the 2 episodes was good and a good intro to the series . for me , The Batman : The Clayface of Tragedy is an
473388	11423174	119303	8.0	criminals beware	as far third movies in a series go , this one isn't half bad . it's not as lite hearted as the previous 2 , and none of the cast return for this installment . it's basically the same plot line . kid is home alone , and is the target of criminals . , but these are no ordinary , bungling burglars . these guys are serious . but , this kid is very clever , and once again his house becomes one big booby trap . again we have the slapstick and pratfalls as the crooks become victims of one painful ( and hilarious ) sequence of events after another . this is actually a very funny movie . i laughed so hard i cried a couple of times . i think it's at least as funny as the two previous movies , but it doesn't have the heart or soul of either of them . but for fun factor alone , it's well worth watching . for me , Home Alone 3 is an
472766	11423174	1185834	8.0	hardly the travesty i'd expected based on the criticisms	before watching this animated Star Wars movie , i was expecting something horrible . but , i gotta say , it isn't that horrible . true , it's slow at times , and at other times it just gets repetitive with pretty much the same action sequences happen over and over again . yet , despite that , i did find it a fairly enjoyable romp . there area some funny moments , and . teeny little spoileri liked the banter between Anakin and his Padewan ( not sure i spelled that right ) and the light saber battles were decent , if not spectacular . i didn't find the dialogue all that bad . some of the baddies are familiar from previous Star Wars movies , but there is a new bad character , who i actually liked and i wished had played a larger role . another little spoilerif you're expecting the usual iconic opening theme , you won't get it here . as well , the equably iconic crawl which sets up the story is missing , instead replaced by a brief voice over , which sounds sillyend of spoiler . and there isn't really much of a story . what story there is hangs by the most fragile of threads . but that's not unusual for a Star wars movie , so that isn't necessarily a valid complaint . for what it was , i liked it . i may get roasted alive for this but i give Star Wars : The Clone Wars an
472906	11423174	387514	8.0	A romantic comedy that is actually funny , very funny at times ( imagine that )	Finally , a decent romantic comedy . not really a chick flick , but something a guy could enjoy as much as a woman . also , very witty , with more than a few laugh out loud moments . great acting from all , good direction , and also very good writing . i won't give away any thing about the plot of the movie , for those who haven't seen it . but i will say this movie is unique for a couple of reasons . first off , it is one of the few movie billed as a romantic comedy , that has comedy . it's actually funny . Imagine that . Second , there is a romance aspect to the film , but it is not so mooshy ( I know mooshy isn't really a word , but it fits ) that guys won't like it . it's almost romance lite . so a guy can see this movie with his girlfriend and actually say he enjoyed it . and , quite frankly , a guy could watch it on his own , without his manhood being questioned . I'd recommend Prime to any one who likes comedy and romance , female or male . a strong
473878	11423174	89003	8.0	" this time , it " s War " ( where have i heard that before ? )	" Death Wish 3 " brings back Charles Bronson as one time vigilante Paul Kersey , now retired . yeah , right . before long Kersey is back to his old ways . but this time , its not just a few muggers at a time , its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city ( New York again , by the way . ) this time its war , so Kersy Hauls out the big guns ( literally ) for this . the body count int his one rivals anything Stallone or Schwarzenegger have come up with . this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch , particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die , or get severely injured in creative ways , which is always a good thing . the violence is not as personal in this one , its , obviously on a much grander scale , sort of like bombing your victims from afar , rather than one on one combat . this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2 , making it easier to watch . there's not much import to this film , its more escapism than anything . its also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspirational , but hose scenes fall flat . they should have left the original " Death Wish " on its own without sequels , but since they didn't , they should have stopped here . 8 / 10
473738	11423174	787505	8.0	very entertaining horror flick , with some brains behind it	rest stop is an enjoyable horror film for the most part . it does veer into disgusting territory for a couple of scenes , but unlike some recent films of the genre does not revel in depravity . the movie has a unique twist that keeps it from being your typical standard horror movie . there are of course , some of the necessary elements for a film of this genre , such as the character who does all the right stupid things , and it does borrow from one or two other movies . however , it is nonetheless an entertaining ride , which should get the adrenaline flowing . there do seem to be some inconsistencies in the movie , although there may be reasons for this . this movie requires more than one viewing in order to fully understand what is happening . it should make you think , and by that i mean about the subtleties of the plot and not the disgust factor . as an aside , the cop who gets his legs run over is played by Joseph Lawrence , one time child actor Joey Lawrence out of 10
472672	11423174	84684	8.0	first rate Chuck Norris movie	Silent is Ondoubtably one of Chuck Norris'best movies . Chuck plays Dan Stevens , small town sheriff who responds to a domestic disturbance and discovers a murder . but that is the least of his worries . he find out the killer is still in the house . after a very long struggle , the killer is shot by police and killed . all seems well , but then murders star happening again and Dan is called in to investigate . let's just say that Dan finds out the hard way that the killer is not so dead . and he is no ordinary man . Dan tracks the maniac down and confronts him , using all his martial arts abilities . the psycho escapes and Dan barely escapes with his life . the most refreshing thing about his movie is the fact that the villain is more than worthy of our hero . in many such films of this genre , the villain is easily and soundly beaten , while the hero sometimes escapes without a scratch . obviously not very realistic . this time , the villain is not just a punching bag . in fact the good guy is in peril at times . the fight scenes are good , especially the climax . the movie also brings up some interesting moral and ethical issues , which are way ahead of their time . aside from that , this is one of Chuck's better movies . very entertaining .
473563	11423174	387564	8.0	well done horror movie	the movie saw was well done in every aspect . i liked the opening sequence , which gave you just enough information to keep watching . i especially liked the intimate setting , which focused more on the characters than their surroundings which were very sparse . you are given background information on the characters , which is perfect for this movie . of course it helps that their are only only two main characters . you can't help but be emotionally involved as they wonder what to do next and how or even if they will survive . i liked the gritty look of the film and the lighting was well done . the actors were believable , and even though the victims were not necessarily the most morally upstanding people , they were still sympathetic enough to root for . the villain was very original and creative , the likes of which , as far as i'm aware had not been seen before , or since . i liked the fact that he wasn't your typical psychopath , in that , in his mind he was giving his victims the chance to redeem themselves , cleanse themselves of sin , and gain a new appreciation for the lives they were given . you might say he was merely doing a good deed . he was sort of a philosopher on the human condition . it was refreshing to see a villain who was behind the scenes and not actually perpetrating his crimes directly , like , say , your garden variety maniac . don't get me wrong , he was obviously crazy and had a messianic complex , holding the power of life and death over his victims . he just wasn't your typical crazy . he was actually a multi-dimensional baddie . imagine that . in a nutshell , he wore many hats . man , this movie is deep on so many levels . anyway , there was also quite a bit of blood and gore , but it was necessary for the story . the ending was also good , naturally setting up nicely for the sequel . i know i'm rambling , so i'll wrap it up . basically , saw was a very good movie . i recommend it highly , especially if you're tired of all the the slice'n dice movies with stupid characters that you actually hope get killed .
473456	11423174	339422	8.0	a movie of a true crime based on a book which may have some basis in truth	this is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid 1970's . based how much on truth it's hard to tell . this much is certain . it is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman . anyway , the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath , including the arrest of a suspect , some 25 years after , who was never considered a suspect at the time . in the movie , Fuhram of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for Martha's surviving family , in particular her mother . the narrative of the film is by the ghost of Martha Moxley , talking in the first person . this is a very effective device in this movie . to me , it adds more impact to the movie , and puts a human face on the murder victim ( if only an actress playing the part ) Maggie grace plays Martha , and i was really impressed with her . there is no way for certain to know Mark Fuhrman's motive in investigating the crime . it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared . or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book . either way , it makes for an interesting movie . it's well acted and fairly fast paced . i don't think there was a lot of extra , unnecessary stuff in the movie , just what was needed to tell the story . one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings , and one would be right . also , one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right . but , as i said , for me , i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials . anything else would have likely required a miniseries . as an aside , there is a miniseries entitled " A Season in Purgatory " which came out 6 years ealier ( 1996 ) which this movie has some parallels to , even if only faint . however , if you like this movie , " Then you may be interested in " A Season in Purgatory " . it is my belief that " a Season in Purgatory " is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime . anyway , for me , Murder in Greenwich " is an
473295	11423174	69608	8.0	very entertaining and politically incorrect 70's game show	even though this game show is from the early seventies , i still really enjoy it . it's not boring at all . in fact it is quite funny at times . there's a lot of things they say that are funny , but they would not get away with today , in this time of political correctness . it's also amusing to see what people wore back then and their hairstyles . man , that's some crazy sht . if you grew up in that era , it certainly is an interesting trip down memory lane , especially if you're the nostalgic type . people were definitely less inhibited back then , and happier , i think . nowadays , any time you wanna do something that goes against convention , it's as if a committee has to study every little detail to make sure no one or their dog ( or cat , or hamster etc . ) gets offended . to me , watching Match game is a very entertaining experience .
473186	11423174	187738	8.0	worthy follow up to the original	" Blade 2 " is obviously the sequel to the original . David S Goyer once again wrote the script , based on characters created for Marvel Comics by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan . Guillermo del Torro takes over the directing reigns from Stephen Norrington . the storyline this time around is more complex than the original . the original had a pretty basic storyline , which is fine for Blade's introduction . now that Blade's character has been somewhat fleshed out , a stronger storyline has to be established . so there is an interesting twist in this film . the stronger story makes the movie more dramatic , so there are less action sequences . the story is slower of course , but it is worth it . a more human sensitive side of blade is revealed . there are still plenty of action scenes , many of which are more spectacular this time around . Wesley Snipes reprises his role of " Blade " , naturally and Snipes really gets to show of his fighting prowess and athleticism in this installment . the direction is as good as the original , though it has its own style . the special effects are improved here , and the tone of the film is darker in generally but there are little touches of mild humour added . the music is again well suited to the movie . overall , a good followup film . a solid
473457	11423174	115348	8.0	sublime but effective mini series giving a snapshot of what the super wealthy and powerful can get away with	this is a compelling , engaging mini series based in part on a real life event and the aftermath . it's long , clocking in at over 2 and a half hours ( without commercials ) but it never once failed to maintain my interest . it's basically about how a young man of wealth and influence commits a horrendous crime , and because of the family influence and power , is able to cover it up for many years . i won't say what happens next . you'll have to watch it to find out . i'm pretty certain most people will find this movie not only fascinating and engrossing , but also illuminating . even though it's a fictional telling of an actual event with fictional characters , both the characters and the event mirror real life people of wealth and privilege and how normal laws and morals do not apply to them . so while you are being entertained , you also get a snapshot of the super wealthy and powerful as a bonus . this is really an ambitious production and it succeeds in what it sets out to do , in my mind . i wouldn't call it powerful exactly . it's more sublime and it just kind of sneaks up on you as it moves toward it conclusion . nevertheless , it is still very effective . the acting in this movie is very good from people you wouldn't necessarily associate with the kind of characters they play in this movie . Brian Dennehy plays the family patriarch and gives a commanding performance . Patrick Dempsey plays a childhood friend of the family . Sherilyn Finn plays one of the daughters of the clan . Edward Herman has a what amounts to an extended cameo , but is terrific in his scenes . but it is Bonnie Bedelia who really impressed me with her character . she isn't in the movie for very long and not until close to the end , but in my mind , she really stand out . i won't say what character she plays because i don't wan to give anything away , even the smallest detail . for me , " A Season in Purgatory " is a strong
472678	11423174	31346	8.0	the inspiration for John Ford's classic My Darling Clementine	i liked this western quite a bit . it is made in 1939 , and some may find the pace a bit sedate , but that didn't bother me . i liked the story and the cast of characters . the main character is Wyatt Earp ( Randolph Scott ) newly deputized as marshal to try to bring some law into the town of Tombstone . The character Of Doc Halliday ( Ceasar Romero ) also plays a prominent role . there were a few scenes which were meant to be funny , and they probably were back in 1939 , but they fell a bit flat for me . it's the movie that inspired the John Ford classic My Darling Clementine ( 1946 ) . the 1957 movie Gunfight at the OK Corral is also apparently inspired by this movie . one thing i should mention is that the sound and the picture were crystal clear , so kudos for Fox for the technical work that went into the DVD . anyway , when all is said and done , i thought this was a pretty good movie . easily an
472876	11423174	443536	8.0	the true ( animated ) story of Red Riding Hood ( not really of , course )	forget everything you've heard about " Little Red Riding Hood " , this is the true story . well , not really of course but is an animated take on the fairy tale . the gist of the story is that the police have been looking for the perpetrator of a series of crimes ( non-violent of course ) , well one crime , actually , committed several times . anyway , a series of events lead the police to 4 suspects : Red herself , ( Anne Hathaway ) Granny ( Glen Close ) , The Woodsman ( Jim Belushi ) The Wolf ( Patrick Warburton ) . we are treated to a series of flashbacks , one by each character depicting the events that had transpired according to their own viewpoint . By the way , almost all the characters in the movie , from the police chief on down , are characters mostly from the original rendition of the fairly tale . Some of these characters are quite amusing anyway , through the flashbacks , we are treated to some comedy , action ( including some extreme sports ) some drama , mystery , and the movie even becomes a musical for a brief time . and there are some suspenseful moments . there are also some scenes of mild to moderate peril , so it might be a bit too much for very young children , otherwise it all adds up to one very entertaining experience suitable for ( generally ) the whole family . as well , it is also unpredictable , right until nearly the very end , when the perpetrator is finally revealed ( it is not who you might think ) . finally , all the actor's voices really went well with their respective roles . truly a wacky , unique tale on the Red riding Hood Fable .
473885	11423174	77269	8.0	Hitler times 94 in modern times	at first i didn't like this movie . i mean , it is a slow paced movie . despite the fact that Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck are in it , i couldn't muster much enthusiasm for it , in the beginning . it does pick up enough in the second act to maintain more interest , so , i did watch the whole movie . the story takes place in 1977 or 78 . the basic premise is that Ezra Lieberman ( Olivier ) a Nazi Hunter ( and presumably concentration camp survivor ) has discovered a plot to make perfect clones of Hitler-94 to be exact . Barry Kohler ( a young Steve Guttenberg ) a young Jewish man has provided Lieberman with some of the intelligence on the plot . The evil mastermind behind the scheme is none other than Dr . Joseph Mengle , ( Gregory Peck ) a sadistic Nazi who tortured many Jews during the war . it is during the last act , where Peck gives a tour deforce performance , that really elevates this movie . however , the movie is something that should be watched because of the message it has . namely , the horrible cost that would be incurred if some madman decided to clone a nut job like Hitler . this movie is actually ahead of its time , but is really relevant in modern times , given the controversy over cloning . normally , i don't go for this message type of movie , but in this case i'll make an exception . the whole concept is disturbing to say , the least , especially when you consider all the nut jobs running around in the world . i'd recommend this movie to anyone .
473582	11423174	29322	8.0	when it comes right down to it , we're all phonies ( )	after watching this movie , one thing really struck me : how talented Carole Lombard was as an actress . she has a real gift for comedy , of which there is a fair amount in this film . i found i very funny , but beyond that , i just thought it was well written , and even more relevant today than back then . it basically skewers every imaginable target , including the price of fame , and paints pretty much everybody as phonies , when you you get right down to it . even your average every day person is painted with that brush . but this is also a romance and drama , and it also works on those levels . Fredric March is the male lead , and he does pretty well in the role . the supporting players are also good , but , like i said , it is Carole Lombard who steals the show . i had a great time watching this film , and highly recommend it . my vote for Nothing Sacred :
473913	11423174	84855	8.0	Newman , Paul Newman	Paul Newman stars in this story of a washed up , alcoholic lawyer , with a a long losing streak . he gets handed a case which he could settle out of court , but doesn't . instead he takes it to trial . that's the gist of The Verdict . it has it's compelling moments , especially when Newman is on screen . he's hard to take your eyes off . Charlotte Rampling is also very good here . Jack Warden has a supporting performance , but his character doesn't have a lot to do . this is really Newman's show . the film is very deliberate in it's pacing , which builds suspense for the last scene . i don't think it's to realistic , but that's not the point . the point is , it's an entertaining tale with great acting
472668	11423174	311429	8.0	very good action adventure movie , with some humour and intrigue	The title League of Extraordinary gentlemen is pretty self explanatory . basically , adventure Allan Quatermain ( Sean Connery ) recruits a group of heroes with various abilities , to take on a villain named the Fantom , and prevent him from starting a World War . the movie takes place in alternate Victorian era . the movie is directed by Stephen Norrington ( Blade ) I enjoyed this film much more than i expected . i really had low expectations , but one day , i saw it cheap and thought what the heck . this one has a lot going for it . lots of action , good special effects , a bit of intrigue and even some humour . i liked the premise and i thought they did a good job with it . i think the movie had the potential to be much worse , but it all worked well . i give this movie a strong
473554	11423174	106393	8.0	spectacular fight scenes elevate this movie	i really enjoyed this movie . it's jam packed with action . the fight scenes are spectacular and many different styles are showcased . this movie focuses more on action than story or characters , compared to the first one , in my opinion . the intensity is much higher in this one and the stakes are raised . the first one is rated PG-13 , while this one is rated R . it is certainly more brutal and graphic in its violence , though i have seen much worse . anyway , this movie is a lot of fun . it's very fast paced . the story is fairly weak , and has been done many times before , but like i said , the fight scenes are spectacular and pretty much make up for the story . all in all , i think it's certainly as good as the first one , maybe a smidgen better . for me , Best of the Best 2 is a very solid
472955	11423174	114167	8.0	a very entertaining story of possession , which does not follow the usual formula	i really enjoyed this movie . it's a movie about a man who , becomes possessed by an evil spirit . at the beginning we are told it is based on factual events , which is possible , but there's no way to verify that claim . for a made for TV , this 1 is quite well done . i think a big part of the reason for this is that the movie focuses more on the acting than than on big budget , bombastic special effects . the effects are low key , but well done . the movie also dwells on the psychological aspects of someone being posses and how they deal with it . the acting is very convincing , more so than in many movies of the genre , made for TV or not . i also like that you don't know the reason for the possession , and when the reason is revealed , it's somewhat surprising ( at least for me , it was ) the movie doesn't take the usual rouete travelled by most in the genre , which is refreshing . all in all , a very entertaining suspenseful , well acted movie . my vote : a strong
472635	11423174	395699	8.0	something different from Vin Diesel	i liked this movie . it's funny , it has action and it has a good message , but it doesn't hit you over the head with it . i will say though that the beginning of the movie is pretty violent . but once you get past those first few minutes , the tone becomes quite lite . Vin Diesel shows his comedic side , and does very well . there are a lot of funny moments in this movie , and there's also some mild action violence . there are a few mild swear words , but nothing offensive . Brad Garrett also has a funny role and is very good as well . if you liked either Cheaper by the Dozen ( 2003 ) or Cheaper by the Dozen 2 ( 2005 ) with Steve Martin , or Yours Mine and Ours ( 2005 ) , with Dennis Quaid and Renee Russo , you will probably like this movie . it is very similar in a lot of respects , but i thought it was funnier than any of those movies . it also balances comedy and action very well
473906	11423174	496436	8.0	as good as the first White Noise movie .	this sequel to white noise is actually pretty good . in terms of thrills , i found it better than the first and it's much more disturbing , and leaves you with a feeling of dread . the story though is much more implausible . it puts a religious spin on the proceedings . while electronic voice phenomena or EVP could have some reality to it , i seriously doubt that there's is any religious aspect to it , but that's just my opinion . things also get a bit muddled at times , at least i thought so . still , i thought Nathan Fillion was good in the lead role , and I like Katie Sackoff as the female lead , but i wish she had way more scenes , as she is barely in the movie . when you add everything up , i think there are more positives than negatives . for me White Noise 2 gets an
472925	11423174	230011	8.0	epic quality animated adventure without the epic length	this is a great animated adventure about the lost city of Atlantis . it has an epic feel with out the epic length . the animation is quite good , even spectacular at times . the movie is funny , dramatic and exciting . the voice actors also really fit their roles , and really put a lot of effort into their characterizations . speaking of which this a great mix of different characters that really play well off each other . plus the story is engaging and compelling . i really enjoyed myself for the 90 minutes or so run time of this movie . the rating for this movie is currently relatively low ( ) to me , the movie is much better than the rating currently reflects . i give " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " a strong
473171	11423174	99871	8.0	intriguing study on the psychological impact of war	without giving too much away , Tim Robbins is Jacob Singer , a soldier who survived Vietnam . twenty years later though , he is having flashbacks , and is losing grip on reality , not knowing what is real and what is fantasy . Elizabeth Pena , Ving Rhames , Eric La Salle , Danny Aiello , Matt Craven co-star . Jason Alexander and S . Epatha Merkerson also have small roles . Robbins gives a convincing performance , but i really liked Pena and Aiello . i thought they were both outstanding . this is a pretty good film , though i think they could have cut out 20 minutes or so . the film is also a bit of a downer at times , which is understandable given the subject matter . this isn't really a complaint , more of a personal observation . it's also very heavy on the drama , so don't expect a lot of action . anyway , for me Jacob's Ladder is an
473234	11423174	129290	8.0	" Laughter is the Best Medicine "	The story of a man who uses laughter to heal people . Hunter Adams , played by Robin Williams , goes through dark period in his life ( acquiring the nickname " Patch " along the way ) and emerges with a new outlook on life . he goes to medical school and becomes a doctor , bucking the system along the way , and butting heads with one of the Deans . the reason : Patch believes that laughter is truly the best medicine . as a result he delivers his own brand of medicine to the patients . along the way he makes some friends and teaches them the value of laughter . the movie also has dark side , and is very heart wrenching at times . but he message that laughter is the best medicine comes through strongly . ( maybe a bit to strongly ) it is a bit maudlin and overly inspirational at times , with some very cheesy scenes and it may not be completely realistic , but it has its heart in the right place .
473331	11423174	20691	8.0	John Wayne's first starring role	i really liked this film . it features John Wayne in his first starring performance . even then , you can tell Wayne has a real presence , although he wouldn't really mature into the icon he is known for until Stagecoach , 9 years later in 1939 . it's about settlers from all over the country heading to the new west to colonize it . Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins up , but for his own personal reasons . most of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film before , which makes the movie even more amazing . they managed to create believable , distinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix here . Cimarron would come out a year later , and had a very similar story , though i didn't like it as much as this movie . for me , The Big Trail is a strong .
473838	11423174	113972	8.0	a very thrilling potboiler ( solid )	this is a very thrilling and suspenseful movie . the movie take place in " real time " meaning that the same amount of time that goes by for the audience , also goes by for the characters . for action and excitement and nail biting suspense , this is the movie . great acting all around including Johhny Depp in the lead role , as well s CHristoper Walken and Roma Maffia , to name a few . i was on the edge of my seat for this potboiler , right down to the last minute . the tension was almost unbearable at times . this is one well written suspense thriller which ranks right up there , at least in my mind . but don't take my word for it . run out and rent it . i'll think you'll really enjoy it . for me " Nick of Time " is a solid
473080	11423174	31448	8.0	first filmed adaptation of Conan Doyle's novel	this is the first filmed version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel . it's also the first of fourteen Sherlock Holmes films Starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as his friend / sidekick , Dr . Watson . this is the second version i have seen , the first being the 1959 version starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee . i liked that one more . this 1939 version , while good , is slow at times . the acting is good , as one would expect . the story is interesting . as i said , this is a good adaptation , other than the slow pace . otherwise , i was entertained . interestingly , even though they are the main stars , Rathbone is billed second , and Bruce billed fourth in the film . anyway , it's a pretty good 80 minute or so diversion . for me , The Hound of the Baskervilles is an
473704	11423174	269347	8.0	a pretty good William Friedkin film ( Did i say that out loud ? )	the basic premise of this film is this : a trained special forces assassin who has gone AWOL from duty , begins killing hunters in backwood Oregen . the only man who may be able to stop is the man who trained him . and so the hunt is on . Benecio Del Torro is Aaron Hallam , the hunted , while Tommy Lee Jones is L . T Bonham , the Hunter . i should mention right away , that this movie has some very graphic and bloody violence , including scenes of war at the very beginning . both Jones and Del Tor are good in their roles . there is a lot of action and the fight scenes i thought were phenomenal , no flashy camera tricks , just well choreographed fighting . unfortunately for me , i have to admit that the director , William Friedkin made a pretty good movie here . i have been a basher of Friedkin for some time , having seen a few of his other films . however , he surprised and impressed me here , so give him credit .
472992	11423174	395584	8.0	sequel to House of 1000 Corpses	this sequel to Rob Zombies House of 1000 corpses , ( which was written and directed by Rob Zombie ) , is a bit different in tone . it's not as dark , there's more action , and there are more funny moments . it's not so much a horror as an action / crime drama . i don't feel it's as clever as House of 1000 corpses , but then , most sequels aren't . it is however , very entertaining and goes in an unexpected direction with a great ending . it's quite the thrill ride . it also sheds a bit more lite on the villains . Rob Zombie directed and wrote this movie once again , and he also produced it . for my money , it's as good as it's predecessor . for me , The Devil's rejects is an
473097	11423174	82694	8.0	very intense action sequences .	Mad Max 2 , also known as The Road Warrior is a different movie than the original . for one thing , you can watch this movie on its own , without having seen the first one . there is a voice over narration at the beginning telling you all you need to know about the events in the first one . the first movie had sustained action throughout . this one however , has less action , but the the action sequences it does have are very intense , and edge of your seat . here , the country is more desolate . the character of Max ( Mel Gibson ) is more developed . Max is no hero , more an antihero . he does what he has too to survive in the wasteland . mostly that means finding enough fuel to keep going . wherever it is he is going . he also has a continuing feud with a vicious biker gang that began in the first movie . for me , i didn't like this movie as much as part one , simply because i thought it dragged a bit . it's still a very good movie though . my vote for Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior :
473440	11423174	121766	8.0	chapter 3	of the 3 prequels , this one is the best . Anakin is now a young man , very close to the dark side . helping him to get there is supreme chancellor Palpatine ( Ian Mcdiarmid ) a dark lord of the sith . Mcdiarmid clearly relishes his role as he brings an intensity and believability that must be seen to be believed . this is an Oscar worthy performance . the movie does a fairly good job of tying things up , as the saga concludes . there are , a few problems with the time line , of course , but despite that , the movie works . what everybody was waiting for was the reveal of Anakin into Darth Varder , and those chilling words : " Rise Lord Vader " ( Palpatine ) " Yes My Master " ( voice of Darth Vader ) so was the last scene worth the wait ? for the most part yes . it treads close to being funny , but stops just short . as for the movie itself , the best of the prequels , and closer in quality to the original trilogy .
472822	11423174	317919	8.0	Keri Russel , Laurence Fishburne , Philip Seymour Hoffman . . . .	the three main reasons this " Mission Impossible " entry is the best yet . yeah , Tom Cruise is back , of course , and does a good job as the main character Ethan Hunt . however , it is the presence of the three actors mentioned in my summary which make this movie succeed . first , Laurence Fishburne , a physically imposing presence for sure , but also extremely charismatic with a very palpably intense screen presence . i think he owns any scene he is in . next , Philip Seymour Hoffman , also a very strong screen presence who manges to be both understated and mesmerizing at the same time . and Keri Russel , ( from the dramatic TV series " Felicity " very impressive here in an action movie . she impressed me the most in this movie . there is just something about her , something intangible you can't put your finger on . the rest of the supporting cast are also strong . also , this third installment in the series is not convoluted , like the first , and not as reality defying as the second . don't get me wrong , there are some stunts that are not too realistic , but to a lesser degree and not as frequent . i also think the story is better and the villain is very strong . this would be the ideal end to the franchise , since it goes out on a high note . but time will tell . the last three or four " Bond " films ( excluding the last one ) were much more unrealistic . i highly recommend Mi : III . an easy
472993	11423174	251736	8.0	bury me in a nameless grave	this may be a horror movie , but it's not a run of the mill horror movie . for one thing , it's actually clever and creative . it's also a very dark comedy . the villains in this movie aren't your typical villains . they're quite memorable , with very good characterizations . the acting is very good , but Sheri Moon ( eventually Sherri Moon Zombie ) stands out with a brilliant performance . there are some really tense moments here , thanks to some good direction and timing . the look of the film is also great . it takes place in the 70's and some scenes are grainy and gritty reflecting many movies made at the time . the soundtrack is killer , with some boffo haunting tracks , and the score is also terrific . the music is 70's era sound , like the movie Planet Terror , one half of the Grindhouse feature . House of 100 corpses is Rob Zombie's first feature film as writer and director . the only other Rob Zombie movie i have seen is The recent Halloween remake , which i liked . i was more impressed with House of 1000 copses though . for me , House of 1000 Copses is a well deserved
473121	11423174	100031	8.0	great movie . loaded with suspense and authentic performances	i was pleasantly surprised by this movie . i thought it was terrific . it's got loads of suspense and tension . i also liked the atmosphere over the movie overall . it's well acted . i found the interaction between the mother and her teenage daughter to be very authentic . the movie is not boring at all . in fact , it movies along at a very nice clip . there is one great ironic scene , which i thought was brilliant . it may not have been original , but it works in this case , regardless . the general premise isn't wholly original , but i like what they did with the material . to me , this movie is quite above average for the suspense / thriller genre . i caught this movie on cable , so it didn't cost me anything ( other than my monthly cable bill , of course ) . i think it's well worth the two hours or so spent watching . for me , Lisa , AKA The Candle Light Killer is an
472798	11423174	80999	8.0	worth watching for the the bad acting and its unintentional comedic value	i liked this movie , mainly just because of its entertainment value . there are some pretty funny moments , most of them unintentional , i imagine . it is also not very politically correct compared to most of todays movies . if you go into this movie expecting good acting , i think you will be disappointed . but , the movie does have some pretty good martial arts fighting scenes , though at times they are ridiculously absurd and unrealistic . i did like the different fighting styles shown in the movie . the sound effects are horrible , yet are great for their comedic value . the movie is very low budget and the plot is almost non existent . but for action and comedy , you can't go wrong with this movie . it is a classic and very hard to find , but if you come across it , you will likely be very amused , at the least . based on the fight scenes and the comedic value , i give " Kill or be Killed "
473859	11423174	289765	8.0	way above average thriller	i liked " red dragon " a lot . it was was well written and well directed . the acting was very good , in particular harvey keitel , in a small role . the action scenes were well done and the characters were sympathetic , so you felt their pain and anguish . the dramatic scenes were done to great effect , not simply filler , but actually serving a purpose . there was also plenty of suspense , excellent in this case , since the movie take place before the events in " the silence of the lambs " do . even though you know the story , the director still manages to keep you on edge and keep you interested in the story . i found the dialogue refreshing , not clichéd and awkward , as is the case quite often . i bought " red dragon and have watched it more than once , enjoying it each time . if this is your type of genre , you will like this movie
473070	11423174	371739	8.0	well worth watching for some good acting and chilling moments	this little movie was released in 2005 , and it is actually pretty good . there are some tense and chilling moments and some decent acting on the whole . i really like Robin Tunney as an actress . i think she is very talented , but she seemed a bit too weepy for my taste , in this movie . the movie is based on the the Zodiac murders of the late 60's . i'm sure the filmmakers took a bit of dramatic license for effect , but from what iv'e read of the case , i think most of the relevant info remained intact . the movie is very dramatic at times , although not boring . in fact , in my opinion , the movie is much more story and character driven than many similar movie in thew genre . we get some insight into a few of the characters , though not a lot . nevertheless , the movie is very engaging and compelling . to me , the most disturbing moments are hearing the Zodiac as he taunts the police . these scenes really sent shivers down my spine . . all in all , this movie is quite good . i haven't seen the newest version directed by David Fincher , so i can't compare the two . for me the 2005 release of " The Zodiac " is a strong
472548	11423174	165982	8.0	rollicking fun on the high seas	i really enjoyed this animated feature . it has something for everyone . there's lots of action and adventure and danger on the high seas . there is also plenty of suspense . i also thought the movie was very witty at times , with some great dialogue . if you're a romance buff , there's some of that too . i thought the animation was spectacular , mixing regular animation with a bit of 3D . the look of the film is fantastic . the voice work is terrific . each voice fit the character perfectly . also the movie is quite fast paced , and never really loses any momentum . i'm not sure what the rating is , but i would give it a PG rating as it gets a bit intense . anyway , all in all , a very fun movie . i give Sinbad : Legend of the Seven Seas a strong
473745	11423174	164052	8.0	Resarcher tests invisibility serum on self , becomes psychotic	" Hollow Man " is about a group of scientists working on an invisibility serum for the military . naturally this research is top secret , with only the military and the researchers knowing about it . the group is led by Sebastien Caine ( Kevin Bacon ) a brilliant if arrogant human being . also part of the team are Linda McKay ( Elisabeth Shue ) ( who also happens to be Sebastiens's ex-girlfriend ) , Matthew Kensington ( josh Brolin ) Linda's current boyfriend , and Sarah Kennedy , ( Kim Dickens ) the resident veterinarian who does her best to make sure that the animals which the serum is being tested on do not come to harm . the serum has been unsuccessful to this point , resulting in the animals dieing horrible deaths . and of course Sebastien is jealous of the relationship between Linda and Matthew . finally , Sebastion becomes impatient and decides to become the guinea pig for the serum . the serum works sort of , but the invisibility does not wear off . Sebastien begins to lose his grip on reality ( due to the effects of the serum ) and becomes psychotic while developing a messianic complex when he realizes he can get away with anything , since no one can see him . suffice to say his dark side emerges and the rest of the team must try to keep him locked in the lab , and also avoid being killed or injured by Sebastion . you can guess what happens next . there are some gory scenes , and if you're an animal lover , you might want prepare yourself .
472875	11423174	274204	8.0	a very well done Joanne Kilbourn murder mystery	this is a Joanne Kilbourn mystery , of the continuing series of movies with Joanne Kilbourn ( Wendy Crewson ) as the main character . Basically , Joanne is a retired police officer , who finds herself knee deep in one mystery after another , involving murder . Technically , she aids the police in the investigation , although she does most of the work , and ends up solving the crime herself ( with the help of the police ) . the police , at least in this movie , are represented mainly by Inpector Philip Millard , Joanne's old partner , played by Victor Garber . both Crewson and Garber are first rate actors , and work very well together . both are very credible in their respective roles , and add an extra air of legitimacy to the project . the rest of the cast is also strong . This movie is very suspenseful , has a lot of action , and some pretty violent and graphic ( for a TV movie ) scenes . the production value feels much higher than it probably is , a rare treat for a TV movie . there is certainly no " movie of the week " feel to this one . I really enjoyed it . i only wish we had more actors the calibre of Crewson and Garber in more movies . ( Garber can be seen in the thrilling spy series " Alias " , with Jeniffer Garner , and Crewson has been in some high profile American movies ) both are underused and underrated in the film industry . Any way , enough prattling on . this movie gets a strong
473807	11423174	309152	8.0	true crime buffs will like it	this documentary type series features 52 minute episodes of crimes committed in the past ( usually one crime per episode ) in which the FBI and local law enforcement cooperate to solve crimes . parts of the crimes are reenacted with actors . throughout the episode a narrator describes the events . real people who were involved in the original investigation are also interviewed in present day and recount their experience with the particular incident . the series is gripping and fast paced , but can be very morbid , as sometimes the particulars of the crimes are fairly well detailed . there isn't always a happy ending , either . if you're a true crime buff and you haven't seen this show i encourage you to check it out . in North America , The 1st season is out on DVD , and the 2nd and 3rd have been announced for release . my vote for The F : B : I : Files is a strong
473691	11423174	97576	9.0	return to action	this third movie in the Indiana Jones series is much liter in tone than the second one , The Temple 0f Doom . there is also more action , a lot more . and there are also number of comic moments , courtesy of the banter between Indiana ( Harrison Ford ) and his Father , Henry ( Sean Connery ) the two have great general and comedic chemistry and both have some good lines . this movie is clever and witty . Connery is a nice addition to the series . i think it's as good , or near as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark , the first one in the series . i liked how the movie ended on a high note . this would have been a fitting end to the series , if they hadn't made a fourth installment , which i have yet to see . as for The Last Crusade , i think it rates a
472881	11423174	52602	9.0	a very clever whodunit ( )	i fo8und this to be a clever little murder mystery . i didn't find it scary , but it was very engrossing and well acted . Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead were excellent , as was the supporting cast liked the setting : an isolated mansion . there was also a great mix of odd character , all whom acted suspicious and any one of them could have been the killer . i liked the fact that i was kept guessing to the end as to the killer's identity . i also thought the movie was very well pace , and never boring . the music was odd , but i did like it . for a black and white movie , this one had a very clear picture and crisp sound . all in all , a very entertaining movie . i highly recommend it .
473696	11423174	89880	9.0	lives up to the standard set by the first one	call me crazy , but i thought this movie was as good as the first one . true , it is a bit more far fetched and there is less of a story , but it makes up for that in sheer excitement . it's very fast paced from beginning to end . the first one had its share of action , but the action her is on a grander scale . i also liked seeing the different ways Rambo outsmarted and dispatched his enemies . and like the first one , Rambo lets his actions do the talking . he's not one to waste words . this movie is also a indictment of the Vietnam War . a subtle indictment , but it is there , nonetheless . overall , this is one fun movie , better than i remembered it from the last time i had seen it , when it first came out in the theatre . for me Rambo : First Blood Part II is a
473473	11423174	177789	9.0	hysterically funny sci / fi spoof of pop culture and " the cult of celebrity "	Galaxy Quest is a comedy sc / fi action adventure film rolled into one . it is a spoof of Star Trek and and other sc / ci TV shows / movies . but more than that , and more importantly , it also pokes fun at popular culture and how absurd we have become as a society . for instance , the worshipping of Celebreties as idols . " the cult of Celebrity " plays a prominent role in this movie . any movie that skewers celebrities and brings them down a peg is always a good thing . this is great satire . in this case it also happens to be hysterically funny at times , with great action and even some romance . the movie is not done in a mean spirited way , so is not overtly offensive or insulting to it's targets ( well , okay , to some it would be , but we won't get into that here ) although i guess , to be fair it is pretty blatant . oh well , cry me a river . honestly , the average human being that enjoys laughing frequently will enjoy this movie
473771	11423174	398712	9.0	loved it	here is a movie with slam bang action and great dialogue . but in order to enjoy it , you will have to suspend your disbelief past the stretching point . if you can do that , then you should really enjoy yourself . id ' say it's basically a summer popcorn movie , but it was released in January . regardless , i had a blast while watching this movie . th violence is nearly off the charts , so if you don't like a lot of violence , you should probably avoid this one . also there is a lot of very coarse language , so if that's not your bag , you might want to look for a different movie . it's basically mindless fun for the most part , but like i said i loved the dialogue . i also really like the strange mix of characters , which make things more interesting . my advice if you choose to watch this movie , pop it in , and turn off your brain for the duration . by the way , i haven't seen the original 1976 version , so i can't compare the two . but for me , the 2005 version of Assault on Precinct 13 is a
473196	11423174	112740	9.0	terrifically entertaining and thought provoking movie dealing with possibility of WW3	i really liked this movie . i'm not really fond of Tony Scott's directing style , at least his last few efforts anyway . but Scott is fairly restrained for this 1995 film . the film takes place during heightened tensions between most of the world ( including the United States and a rogue Russian leader who has amassed some support for his cause , which is too start World War Three . most of the action takes place at sea as tensions come to a boiling point as the crew of one U . S . Submarine , led by seasoned veteran Captain Frank Ramsey ( Gene Hackman ) is on the verge of launching nuclear missiles at the enemy after being attacked by what may be a rogue Russian attack sub . however , things are not that simple , as Ramsey's XO ( executive officer ) Lt Commander Ron Hunter ( Denzel Washinton ) who has never been in a battle situation before and he and Ramsey butt heads regarding navy protocol in this particular situation , leading to chaos on the ship . there is more than that going on , but i don't wan't to give too much away . there's quite a bit of intense action and tension as things progress . Both Hackman and Washington are both superb actors and it shows here . as the two face off , you can see the intensity crackle between the two . there are also some great supporting actors in the movie . that coupled with Scott's restraint and the lack of kinetic and sometimes choppy action sequences that have become his trademark really make this film work . there is only one thing i didn't like about the movie , and i don't mean to be critical of Americans in general , with this , ( his pertains more to many filmmakers ) but here goes . for me , there was a bit too much American flag waving . the U . S is more than once referred to as the greatest nation in the world . now there is nothing wrong with patriotism from any country , but there is such a thing as overkill . i think many people would say that their own country is the greatest ( or at they may think it ) or maybe i'm wrong . don't misunderstand me , i think the U . S is a great country , despite its problems . the ironic thing to me is that Tony Scott is actually from the U . K . otherwise , the movie itself is highly entertaining and thought provoking . my little complaint is merely an observation and doesn't take too much away from the film's quality . therefore i give " Crimson Tide " a
473528	11423174	118771	9.0	gripping , edge of your seat thriller	this is one intense nail biting movie . basically , Jeffrey Taylor ( Kurt Russel ) and his wife Amy ( Kathleen Quinlan ) are driving on a lonely stretch of highway , when there vehicle inexplicably breaks down . they flag down a passing trucker who says he will take Amy to the nearest town for help while Jeff stays with the vehicle . flash forward sometime later and Amy has not returned . i leave it at that . if you wanna know more , then you'll have to watch the movie . what follows is nail biting suspense and tension and lots of action . you'll have to employ some suspension of disbelief ( though much less than many films ) once you do that , you should enjoy this movie . i was on the edge of my seat quite a bit . for me , " Breakdown is a
473258	11423174	112760	9.0	action , adventure , danger , romance and humour ( what else do you need ? )	i don't see why this movie has such a low rating here ( ) i mean it has load of action , suspense , intrigue , romance . it's funny and has great stunts . granted , it doesn't have the epic scope of the " Pirates of the Caribbean " films , but it's a different movie . it's a light hearted , fun romp which doesn't pretend to be anything else . it's not just fun and games , of course . there are some sc4ens of peril and danger , but these elements are all balanced very well . add to that , The performances of Matthew Modine and Geena Davis , as well as a great supporting cast , and you have the ingredients for one terrific movie . and lets not forget the direction of Renny Harlin . these things are all enough for me to highly recommend the movie . for me " Cutthroat Island " is a strong
473619	11423174	396401	9.0	i thought it was very suspenseful , creepy and entertaining	i thought this was a really good movie . it's a sort of ghost story / end of the world prophecy combination . it has some similarities to both " The Ring " and " The Grudge " . i didn't really care for those 2 movies . i just didn't feel they worked for me . this 1 however , worked really well for me . there are many very suspenseful and eerie moments . the hair on my neck stood up a lot in this movie . i thought the acting was pretty good . i also liked that fact that they kept you guessing about things until the end . i did , anyway , and i wasn't sure how it would end . i like unpredictability in these kinds of movies . the ending is sort of open ended , so you can come to your own conclusions . i think this is 1 of the better movies of this genre , that i have seen . i'm sure there are lot's of plot holes and inconsistencies , if you really look for them . but i just wanted to be entertained and hopefully creeped out for a couple hours , and i was . besides , i / m sure every movie has flaws of some kind . it just depends what your reasons for watching are . if you did enjoy " The Grudge " and " The Ring " , you may enjoy this movie as much or maybe more . for me , " 11 : 11 : Hell's Gate is a
473817	11423174	118708	9.0	very funny , hysterically at times	this is a very funny movie . Chris Farley is hysterical as an inept , clumsy ninja of sorts . the laughs come fast and furious in this one , and i have to say i laughed hard a lot . yes , the movie is silly , but in a good way . there is no toilet humour in this movie , which is nice . they're not scraping the bottom of the barrel to get laughs . the humour in this movie is something most people will relate to or at least get . there are also some dramatic moments which are done well . Nicolette Sheridan plays the sort of love interest , and she does a good job in her role . of course , she's also easy on the eyes . if you like movies with a lot of physical comedy and pratfalls , this may be your movie . this movie is not an academy award winner , obviously , but then , it's not that type of movie . for me , this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in quite some time . " Beverly Hills Ninja " gets a from me .
472589	11423174	91209	9.0	classic horror suspense that stands up well over 20 years later	i thought this was a very good movie . it had action and suspense . it was very intense in some scenes . i also thought Rutger Hauer was very convincing as a psycho , while C . Thomas Howell is good as the hero . Jennifer Jason Leigh is also good in a supporting role . there is also a very inventive and nail biting torture scene that doesn't end the way you might think . another thing i really liked was the fact that many things are implied , but not shown , adding another dimension to the movie . this movie certainly had me on the edge of my seat a lot . to me , " The Hitcher is a classic , and still stands up well today . i'ts low budget , but effective . i give this movie
473718	11423174	808417	9.0	superb	i really enjoyed this film . i thought it was so well done . it's in traditional animation and it tells the story of a little girl growing up in Iran , through the revolution , and the war with Irag , and her life beyond those events as she grows up to adulthood . the movie is touching , funny and sad , but manages not too be depressing . the animation changes from black and white to bright colours depending on what is happening in any given scene . it's narrated very well , by who i assume is the actual person the movie is about . at least it's told her from point of view . regardless , her voice is a perfect fit for the movie . in short , this is a movie that exceeded my expectation , and was well worth watching . my vote for Persepolis is a
473697	11423174	83944	9.0	the first Rambo movie	this is the firs movie in the Rambo series , and it's a good one . at least i think it is . it's a about a Vietnam veteran , and Green Beret ( Stallone ) who drifts into a sleepy town , for reasons of his own , minding his own business . but the local law , including the sheriff , ( Brian Dennehy ) , don't want his kind around . Rambo gets pushed to far , and decides to push back , unfortunately for the local law enforcement . if you haven't seen the movie , i won't give anything else away . this movie has a simple , straight forward story , that's fairly high on realism . it's not that far fetched that the events in the movie could happen . i believe Stallone should have at least been nominated for an academy award for his performance as Rambo , and Brian Denehhy should also have been nominated in a supporting category . both were very believable in their roles . also noteworthy is David Caruso in an early role . anyway , for me , First Blood is a
473768	11423174	384806	9.0	just as disturbing and creepy as the first , and a bit better	for me , this updating of the original 1976 movie of the same name , is just as good . obviously it's been changed somewhat , given the advances in technology since 1979 . however , it is no less scary . i also think that Ryan Reynolds ( George Luts ) and Melissa George ( Kathy Luts ) were at least as good as James Brolin and Margot Kidder , maybe a bit better . the children were all acted well enough , but they didn't really stand out or anything . this time Philip Baker Hall plays the Priest ( played by Rod Steiger in the original ) . i actually liked him in the role a bit more job than Steiger . not to take anything away from Steiger . i had just as many chills running down my spine this time , as in the original . there is a bit of CG , but i don't think it detracts from the overall effectiveness of the movie . i guess i actually liked this version a bit better than the 1979 version , but that's just me . i give The Amityville Horror ( 2005 ) an
473876	11423174	209958	9.0	dark , disturbing , sick and twisted , and brilliant	wow . what a great film . this movie has everything . it'visual style is amazing . great colours . it has a very dark tone at times , and is very disturbing , and even sick and twisted . it's basically about a serial killer who kidnaps women and tortures them , both psychologically and physically . there's bit of twist on the usual plot of movies in this genre . suffice it to say that the F . B . I discovers one victim recently kidnapped who has a very short time to live . in order to find out where she has been taken , they turn to a women named Catherine Deane ( Jennifer Lopez ) who can enter the mind of the psychopath ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) through a kind of virtual reality and get the information they need . how and why does she do this and will it be in time to save the girl ? you'll have to watch it to find out . as i mentioned in my summary , this movie is very disturbing . the psycho , D'Onofrio is mesmerizing . he oozes evil and cruelty . this is a truly astonishing performance . Vince Vaughn plays one of the F . B . I agents on the case . i've never seen Vaughn in a serious role . who knew he could act ? he's very credible in his performance . Lopez is OK in her role , but to me , she's not in the same league as Vaughn and D'Onofrio ( at least in this movie . she gets to preen and look pretty and pouty . this movie doesn't move at a break-neck pace . for the most part , it is a psychological drama , but it is very compelling . the last 20 minutes or so , the suspense is ratcheted up . there is some definite depth to this film , to be sure , but it also beautiful to look at . this is one of the best films i have seen in some time . for me " The Cell " is a strong .
473297	11423174	126029	9.0	one of the funniest animated movies ever made	" Shrek is one very funny movie , riotously so at times . it's well written , and very well paced . if you like to laugh , you should really like this movie . the voice actors are also very suited to the characters , and the characters themselves are quite an odd crew . in all the best ways possible . the only drawback i can think of is that the film has many pop culture references as well as references to other movie . if you are not an avid movie watcher and you ' re not into pop culture , some of the jokes may be lost on you . otherwise , prepare yourself for a very sore stomach as the jokes are fast and furious at times . for a change , i'm actually giving this film a higher rating ( ) than it currently has here . " Shrek " is a definite
473166	11423174	258463	9.0	first in the Bourne series ( )	this is in great movie . it has tons of action , spectacular fight scenes , beautiful locales . it's a very taut , intelligent movie with a very good story . Doug Lyman directs and does a superb job . Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , and is incredible in the role . the guy can act , that's for sure . Franka Potente plays a pretty big role as well . there is also a great supporting cast . the dramatic moments are done very well and are very compelling . there's lots of suspense and tension , as well as some twists and turns . i liked the characters themselves , as well as each how each actor made their roles their own . as this type of movie ( Spy / intigue ) goes , this is one of the best of the genre . it should keep you glued to your seat for the 119 minute running time . if you like this movie , you might also want to check out Mr . and Mrs . Smith ( and vice versa ) , also directed by Doug Lyman . for me , The Bourne Identity is an .
473271	11423174	160399	9.0	very , solid , well done sci / fi entry ( one of the best i have seen so far )	this is a terrific , well acted movie . it has plenty of action , a very good storyline and is also realistic . it asks many questions and leaves the viewer to answer most of them . i was drawn into this movie right from the beginning until the very end . there are some great , and unexpected ( for me , anyway ) plot twists . the ending i thought was brilliant . i felt the writers really captured the look and feel of a futuristic earth at war with the enemy . i also liked the fact that you never really know who the enemy is , until the very end . even then , i wasn't sure . if you are looking to be entertained , you should give this movie a try . if you like compelling and thought provoking action and drama , you should also give this movie a try . this movie has some intelligence behind it , which many movies today are sorely lacking . this is one of the best movies of the Sci / Fi genre i have seen to date . i wouldn't call it a masterpiece , but it is a very solid , well done film . My vote for " Imposter " is
472751	11423174	460681	9.0	equal parts Buffy , Charmed and X-files , . . .	which in this case , is a good thing . this show just keeps getting better and better each episode . if that trend continues , Supernatural should be on the air for years to come . not only are the stories compelling , but the acting is first rate thanks to Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles , who play brothers Sam and Dean Winchester . their characters are also well developed and very sympathetic . the writing is also very strong , with some very good dialogue , including some decent humorous moments to lighten the mood , as the show is very dark . if you're a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Charmed , and / or X-files , you should like this show , as it is a mix of those three shows . for me , Supernatural is a
473007	11423174	451079	9.0	a very well done Dr . Seuss adaptation	after living through the travesty that was the live action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat , i wasn't sure what to expect . this movie is not live action , which is a plus . i was pleasantly surprised by it . it's actually clean wholesome fun the whole family can enjoy . there's a little action and adventure , and a lot of comedy . the movie is also touching . it also has a message , that basically says , we're all significant and we all deserve to be treated equal . it's not heavy handed at all . in fact , i thought it was quite subtle . i also liked the voice cast . Jim Carrey was very good as Horton , Steve Carell was also good as his mouse friend , and Carol Burnett as the Kangaroo who rules the forest was also good . parents , this is a movie you can take your kids to ( and enjoy yourself ) without worrying if there is anything that is not appropriate .
473728	11423174	409182	9.0	very thrilling and suspenseful disaster flick	i really enjoyed this movie . i found It entertaining , thrilling and exciting . i also found it suspenseful . it was also very touching and sad at times . really felt for the characters . the movie starts off with a bang , almost right away . once that happened i was sure the rest of the movie would be less exciting . i was wrong in this case . the acting was good . the CGI was excellent . the movie didn't make very much money at the box office , which surprises me . i thought it was much better than many movie that made lots of money . but everyone has there opinion . the rating ( ) is kinda low in my view . the only thing i have a little problem with is the ending . it's not a bad ending . it's just that i found it a bit abrupt . i hoped we would have a few scenes showing how the survivors were doing down the road , how they had coped with the tragedy . other than that , i have no complaints about the movie . my rating for " Poseidon " is
473816	11423174	433442	9.0	very intelligent well written suspense thriller	i'm really surprised by the low rating this movie currently has ( ) . i really liked it . that's saying a lot because i generally don't like Sarah Michelle Gellar . however , i didn't mind her in this movie . this movie kept me at unease throughout , not knowing what might happen next . the movie is filled with an air of dread . i also liked the look of the movie . very dark and atmospheric with muted colours . i found that very effective . the story itself is unique and is not predictable . i thought i had it figured out a few times , only to find out i was wrong . near the end , i came close to figuring it out , but it turned out i wasn't quite right . any movie that can keep you guessing to the end is doing something right , in my mind . there is lots of suspense in this movie , but no gore , which is very refreshing . this is one of the better suspense / thriller movies i have seen in a long time . i had low expectation going into this movie , and those expectation were shattered . if you're looking for a suspense movie with clever writing and good characters , check this movie out . for me , " The Return " is a
473747	11423174	206314	9.0	a real thrill ride from start to finish	" Joyride " is a very good film . it combines elements of suspense , action and humour skillfully . the story involves Fuller ( Steve Zahn ) and Lewis ( Paul Walker ) Thomas , two brothers on a road trip , who play a cruel prank on a trucker . so , the trucker decides to get revenge on them and terrorize them . meanwhile the brothers have picked up Venna ( Leelee Sobieski ) who has no idea what she is getting herself in for . However she soon finds out as she too becomes terrorized by the trucker and will play an important role in his revenge . basically , what follows is action , suspense , some humour and some scary moments . this movie is a real nail biter . the acting is convincing and the film is well paced . i highly recommend it
472578	11423174	472219	9.0	outstanding ( may be the best animated Batman adventure to date )	this is a great movie . it has a very good story , good characters , and lots of action . it's also very creepy at times , and there an air of eeriness to the movie . you definitely can fell a sense of danger and jeopardy for both The Batman and the rest of Gotham city . the main villain and the other characters are well written . the movie is very engaging and compelling . as well , the voice acting is very well done . the voices and characters really fit together . this may be the best animated Batamn movie yet , and it ranks right up there with live action movies as well . if you're into Batman , you should enjoy this movie . i have to give " The Batman vs Dracula " a solid
473594	11423174	264464	9.0	terrifically entertaining lite hearted fare from Steven Spielberg	Steven Spielberg directed this light hearted " based on a true story " crime drama . it's basically about one young man who assumes several different identities while forging millions of dollars worth of checks without the FBI being aware of it . along the way , he poses an a doctor , lawyer and a commercial pilot . once the FBI does catch on to him he manges to stay at least one step ahead of them . this movie takes place in the 60's and in this day and age , a Frank Abagnale would not likely have been successful in forging checks and / or eluding the authorities . Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role of Frank Abagnale . leading the FBI investigation is Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks . it's fun to see the two try to outwit each other , and there are some close calls for Frank , in which he is moments from being discovered . just like in The Terminal , Steven Spielberg shows he is just as skilled with the lighter fare as with the darker subjects he is known for .
473436	11423174	93640	9.0	exciting and suspenseful	to me , this is a brilliant political / military suspense / thriller . it's starts off pretty quickly and just goes from there . there isn't a lot of time for character development in this movie , but the suspense and intrigue makes up for it . there are some great actors here , including Kevin Costner , Gene Hackman , and Will Patton . Costner and Hackmman are good , but Patton really impressed me here . George Dzunda also stars and his role is small , but i thought he was very good . i also liked Sean young . it's too bad we don't see her in that many movies . many people might say this is a formulaic movie , and that could be true , but there are bad formulaic movies and good formulaic movies . for me , this falls into the very good category . for one thing , it kept my attention the whole time and was very exciting . my vote for No Way Out : a
473731	11423174	59000	9.0	an interesting look at some of the making of " The Railrodder " 1 of Keaton's later films	this is a " National Film Board of Canada " documentary . it chronicles some of the the making of " The Railrodder " , a short film that Keaton did late in his career . it also gives some insight into Keaton and his early life . i thought this was a very good documentary . it was well written , humorous and entertaining . it's just under 1 hour , but there is a lot of info in that time . it is a bit sad to watch , as Keaton is clearly in the end stages of his life . in fact , he died the next year ( 1966 ) . nevertheless , i think the filmmakers did a good job with the film . some of Keaton's Genius is still evident in the film , at least to me . unlike many documentaries , which tend to be drawn out and boring , this 1 is not , at least in my view . if you are a Keaton fan , you might like this documentary . i am , and i give this film .
473200	11423174	118453	9.0	brilliant	wow . this depiction of the Spanish-American war , and one particular American regiment , took my breath away . there may be some historical liberties taken , but who cares . this TV mini series was outstanding . the battle scenes were something to behold . John Milius directed and co-wrote this movie . he also wrote several episodes of the TV series Rome . the acting her is first rate . Tom Berenger plays Theodore Roosevelt ( before he became President ) who led the regiment . Sam Elliot plays Capt . Bucky O'Neil , Gary Busey plays Gen . Joseph ' Fighting Joe ' Wheeler . also in the cast are Illeana Douglas as Edith Roosevelt , and Chris Noth . there are many others in the cast and all are superb . this movie is about 3 hours long , but it doesn't feel like that at all . this is one of the best war movies i have seen .
473294	11423174	120616	9.0	action , adventure , danger and humour	this a very entertaining and funny " Indian Jones " type of movie . it's also very fast paced with some great visual effects . the acting is not half bad either . this movie is no Academy Award winner , but for sheer entertainment value , it ranks pretty high . their'e not a lot to dislike about this movie . sure it's not realistic , but who cares , it's not supposed to be . i liked the sword fights a lot . i thought they were exciting and well done . there's some funny lines as well and some great sexual tension and chemistry between the two lead characters Rick O'Connell ( Brendan Frasier ) and Evie Carnahan ( Rachel Weisz ) . also John Hannah is very funny as Evie's lazy , cowardly brother Johnathon . all in all , a very entertaining experience . " The Mummy " gets a from me
472840	11423174	68421	9.0	another great John Wayne epic	this is a terrific John Wayne western epic . it's the story of Wil Andersen ( John Wayne ) and the 11 school age boys he ends up hiring for a 400 mile cattle drive . it seems the cattle drivers he was going to use , left for green pasture . well , actually the chance for gold . anyway , Andersen and the boys encounter danger , excitement and adventure along the way . once again , i'm struck by the screen presence Wayne has , though i shouldn't be . this is Wayne in his mid sixties and he still commands the screen . i've seen a few of Wayne's westerns and have enjoyed each one so far . this movie is about 135 minutes , but i was glued to the screen the whole time . for me , The Cowboys is easily a
472756	11423174	72308	9.0	great disaster movie !	i think this disaster movie may be greater than The Poseidon Adventure , which is also a very good movie . the title pretty much speaks for itself . this was certainly a grand undertaking , i think more ambitious than The Poseidon Adventure . i found it actually more exciting and compelling . it's pretty fast paced . it also looks pretty realistic from the effects standpoint , whatever they had at the time . there are a huge number of big stars of the day in this one . but the real star of the movie is the building and the fire . there are plenty of explosions but the last big explosive sequence was particularly impressive and must have been no small feat to pull off . there's only thing i didn't like about this film , and this is just a minor quibble . i didn't think the theme sing ( sung near the beginning of the movie ) really fit into the movie . it just seemed out of place . but that isn't enough to detract from the rest of the movie . for me , The Towering Inferno is a
473482	11423174	326769	9.0	very entertaining movie with a strong story anchored by great performances from the lead actors	very good movie . it's about motorcycle street racing , but there is more than that going on . the movie is also about relationships , love and the struggles it takes to get to where you want to be . to me , the story was very deep and anchored by some very fine acting performances . the two main characters are played by Laurence Fishburne and Derek Luke . Fishburne is " Smoke " champion Street racer who has never , ( as far as i could tell ) been beat . he holds the title of " King of Kali " and is the leader of " the Black Knights " , one of the racing teams . . Luke Plays Kidd . an upstart young man who wants nothing more than to dethrone " Smoke " . of course it will not be easy , maybe even impossible . who can tell . if you wanna know more , you'll have to watch the movie . the only thing i will say is that there is a revelation which adds a new dimension to things . there are of course some very nice motorcycles and some good racing scenes . there are also some crazy stunts that are amazing . and there are some hot babes . when you put all that together , it makes for quite a show . i would have to disagree with the low rating this movie has . sometimes it boggles my mind and i wonder what people are really looking for in a movie . i know everybody has their own opinions and movie tastes are ( usually ) subjective , but it is still no less mystifying . For me , " Biker Boyz " is a
472962	11423174	87538	9.0	a good , family underdog film	The Karate Kid , while not as iconic as , say , Rocky , is a classic in its own right . this is another story of the underdog triumphing over adversity . this time it is a teenager named Daniel Larusso ( Ralph Macchio ) who has just moved to a new city . very quickly he gets on the bad side of the town's local karate champ , Johnny Lawrence ( William Zabka ) and is bullied from then on . However , just when he is about to be beaten to a pulp , someone saves him . That someone is Mr . Myagi ( Pat Morita ) , a humble , diminutive man with great fighting skill . But there is more to Mr Myagi than meets the eye . He is also very wise , as Daniel soon learns . Daniel and Mr Myagi soon develop a bond and without Daniel realizing it , Mr . Myagi begins teaching him karate . Daniel learns that karate is not just learning how to fight , but how to be better person . In the end Daniel regains his respect . this movie is a good family movie , with minimal and mild language and some fight scenes , but is not graphic . Martin Kove turns in a wonderfully villainous performance as Kreese , Johnny Lawrence's sensei . his motto is no mercy , when it comes to fighting . Elizabeth Shue plays Ali , who becomes Daniel's girlfriend . this is a true classic which is entertaining but also has a good message . a strong
472738	11423174	192731	9.0	what is so bad about this movie ?	nothing that should cause it to have such a low rating . ( ) at least not in my mind . i admit , at first , i thought many of the characters were shallow and unlikable , and much weaker than in the first movie . but that changes somewhere along the way . the movie is not as original as the first , but it does a lot of things right . again , it's unpredictable with many suspects each having compelling motives to be the killer . i think it is as creepy and eerie as the original . it may even be a bit more fun at times . i really enjoyed it . so it's not that original , so what ? if a movie is doers enough other things right , that shouldn't really matter . unless it's a blatant rip off of other movie , which it isn't . i think it pays homage to other movies , sure , but that's not the same thing . for me , Uban legends : Final Cut " is an
472797	11423174	93748	9.0	insanely funny comedy	basically this movie is a combination " Odd " Couple " , ' road trip disaster ' movie . it is insanely hysterical at times as well as very heartwarming and touching . there are a few sober moments in the film , giving you a break from laughing your a off . the acting is good all around . Steve Martin and the late , great John Candy work very well together . the y just seem to the perfect combination . Martin plays is the perfect straight man for Candy's antics , but Martin has his funny moments as well . i can't think of any reason to dislike this movie . there is one scene with Martin at the car rental agency where the f word is used in a angry outburst . other than that , the movie would be suitable for the whole family . " Planes , Trains and Automobiles gets a from me
473327	11423174	287978	9.0	director's cut of Daredevil - outstanding ! ! !	OK , i finally saw the director's cut of Daredevil and wow ! ! ! . i was impressed . this blows the theatrical version out of the water . this is a whole new movie . the story flows better and makes much more sense . it also has much more of an emotional impact . the running time for this version is longer , but because the story flows so smoothly , it goes by much faster than the theatrical version . i'm not sure what the idiots responsible for releasing the inferior theatrical version were on , but it must have been something very potent . It's obvious studio big wigs don't always have an idea of what constitutes artistic or even technical merit . the director's cut was better made from both a technical and artistic stand point and would have performed much better at the box office . don't even waste your time with the theatrical version . watch the director's cut instead .
472880	11423174	618139	9.0	a very well done episode ( / )	this is one of the few full episodes of The Justice League series i have seen , and i liked it . this is the second episode of the third season of The Justice league . i liked it quite a bit . i thought the story was unique and interesting and pretty straight forward . this particular episode features Batman , Superman and Wonder Woman . the villain is more than match for both Batman and Wonder Woman and a even physical match for Superman . the episode is fast paced , and has great action sequences . it briefly shows a dark side of Superman , and even a lighter side . the voice casting is very good . each of the voices feel appropriate for the characters . for me , Justice League : For the Man Who Everything is an
472826	11423174	119994	9.0	Richard Gere owns this film	this is a great murder mystery / psychological suspense thriller . this time it's Richard Gere who owns film . just a year earlier , Gere was in a movie called " primal fear , in which he played opposite Edward Norton . Norton owned that film , with his performance , and Gere does the same with this film . the film takes place in China , where an America lawyer ( Gere ) is on business . one morning , his world is turned upside down , as he finds himself accused of murder , with what seems an ironclad case against him . him . he must fight to free his name , all the while battling the corrupt Chinese government and justice system . this movie , like " Primal Fear , will have you on the edge of your seat , right to the end . Gere is brilliant in this here . i highly recommend it . for me , " Red Corner is mesmerizing . as a result , i give it
472687	11423174	100802	9.0	another classic Arnie film	wow . i loved this classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movie . it's funny , fast paced . has some great lines , including some one liners from Arnie . it's also outrageously funny and over the top . It's based on a short story by Philip K . Dick , and it's one of the better screen adaptations of a Dick story . Paul Verhoeven ( Hollow Man , Starship Troopers , Basic Instinct ) directed it , while Ronald Shusset , who wrote the screen story for Alien , also wrote the screenplay and screen story for this movie . there is some brief nudity , some violence and a bit of language . compared to other Arnie films , though , the amount of coarse language is very low . for me , this movie is a thrill ride . my vote for Total Recall is a
472669	11423174	349683	9.0	Un-rated director's cut . . . awesome	i really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end . the movie basically tells the story of King Arthur ( Clive Owen ) and his loyal knights on their quest for freedom around the year 400 AD . King Arthur and his knights have been indentured to the Roman Empire for fifteen years , carrying out missions for them . Now , the Romans have agreed that if they fulfill one more mission , they will be free . Ioan Gruffud ( Reed Richards , Fantastic Four ) plays Lancelot . Hugh Dancy ( Black Hawk Down , Basic Instinct 2 ) plays Plays Galahad and Keira Knightleyb ( both Pirates of the Caribbean movies and the upcoming 3rd ) plays Guinevere . Stellan Skarsgard ( Bootstrap Bill , Pirates 2 and 3 ) also stars . the movie is directed by Antoine Fuqua . ( Training Day , Tears of the Sun ) this is one very entertaining film with loads of action . not being much of a history buff , i have no idea how historically accurate to the times it is , but i don't care . it is a very fast paced , fun film . if you are a history buff , this movie might disappoint you , but if not , sit back and enjoy .
473763	11423174	295700	9.0	similar to " The Hills Have Eyes " except it's good	Wrong Turn is about a group of teenagers stranded in the remote woods and terrorized by a family of cannibalistic psychos . decent acting , a fair amount of suspense and a few gory scenes make up this movie . the movie is well paced , with very few dead spots i . e filler . there are no unintentional funny scenes , which is always a bonus . the music suits the movie well . the characters of course do all the required stupid things . there is not a lot of character development , but the characters are fairly well written and sympathetic . the makeup dept . did a good job . the death scenes are realistic and the psychos look suitably freaky without being over the top . all in all a fun movie with a few " jump out of your seat " scares .
473040	11423174	406816	9.0	a harrowing , authentic movie about the heroes of the U . S Coast Guard ( the rescue swimmers )	i really enjoyed this movie . for one thing , we actually have a movie about real heroes , who are not cocky and arrogant , but do their jobs with little recognition . the heroes i'm talking about are the men and woman of the coast guard , specifically the rescue swimmers . in most cases , they do not know the people they are saving , and many times they they will never know their names . this film focuses on the U . S Coastguard , and stars Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher as the main characters . Costner plays Ben Randall , a legendary rescue swimmer , who , due to a tragedy during his last mission , find himself as the instructor of the Coast Guard's " A " school , where th best of the best are trained . Kutcher plays Jake Fischer , a cocky young , high school swim champion , whose only reason for being there is to beat all the records , most of then held by Randall . from here on , the movie follows the predictable Hollywood formula for this genre . however , it is better than many movie of its type . one reason for that is the realism in the rescue scenes . there are some really harrowing , thrilling moments . the dramatic scenes are also well done . Kevin Costner is very convincing in his role . however , Kutcher really impresses , with his maturity , and dare i say it , depth . he is definitely evolving as a serious actor . Sela Ward has the thankless role as Randall'e neglected wife . her screen time is limited and i got the impression she was sort of coasting along with her character . but to be fair , she isn't really given the screen time needed to bring more depth to the character . that is the nature of role , which is why it is thankless . Andrew Davis ( under Siege , The Fugitive ) directed the Guardian , and did a brilliant job bringing the script by Ron . L Brinkerhoff to life . finally , i should mention the Coast Guard motto : " So Others May Live " . that tells you how selfless these men and women are , putting their lives on the line for people they don't know . it's nice to see them get some recognition , and maybe the movie will inspire people to join the Coast Guard . anyway , although this movie would not be called a masterpiece ( it isn't that kind of move ) it is an excellent film in its own right . I give " The Guardian " a strong
473101	11423174	804516	9.0	the best horror / thriller i've seen in awhile	i thought this was the best horror / / thriller i've seen in awhile . it's jammed with intensity . Wes Bentley and Rachel Nichols are great as the two m main characters . there are a few pretty bloody and graphic scenes . ( possible minor spoiler ahead ) if you're an animal lover , there's one scene that might really bother you . if i were to stop and think about , i'm sure there are logic gaps , but didn't notice because i was just too wrapped up in the movie . anyway , a parking garage is a perfect setting for a horror movie , if it's done right . not too long ago , i watched a so called horror movie with the same setting , but it didn't work at all . this one does though . i highly recommend it . for me P2 is a
473765	11423174	102585	9.0	4th entry in the Omen Series near comparable to the original	Whew . i just finished watching " The Omen 4 : The Awakening . i know many people think it is nothing more than an inferior made for cable piece of crap . i disagree . for my money , this movie is nearly on par with the original . there are some terrifying moments that got my heart racing . the acting was very good . Faye Grant is terrific as the mother of the evil child Delia ( Asia Viera ) . Micheal Woods plays the father and husband and is one of the weak spots in this movie . although to be fair , his character is really peripheral , so the blame cannot lie totally with him . However , it is Asia Viera who plays Delia who is the true standout . she can convey evil with just a look . she is very charismatic , and dare i say , has the same natural ability of Harvey Stevens , who plays the role of childhood Damien in the original . the story is quite similar to the original . congressman Gene York and his wife Karen end up adopting a baby girl at an orphanage and of course very little is known of the biological parents . Strange occurrences begin to happen . people die mysterious deaths . Karen begins to suspect there is something horribly wrong about the child . there is an interesting twist to the story which i thought was very inventive . music is used to great effect in this movie , some of it borrowed from the original movie . i also have to say that the production values are very high for this film . of course , the violence of the deaths is toned down abit , but this movie doesn't rely on cheap gore , but on suspense . besides , the original did not rely on violence either . One issue i do have is that the ending was a cop out , and didn't seem plausible . it just didn't fit . changing gears for a second , i have to wonder why Faye Grant is not a huge Hollywood star on the big screen . perhaps ii is by choice . She is a fine actress , as good as or better than many of the so called actresses we have today . anyway . this movie should give you some genuine chills .
472610	11423174	70078	9.0	" the love of money is the root of all evil "	if you like anthology collections like Tales From the Crypt and Creepshow , you should like this movie . i think it's better than both . basically it's five separate stories dealing with the occult . all five stories though separate , begin with an antique shop which hold many strange items . in each story , someone comes int possession of an item thinking the cam away with bargain . but the get much more than the bargained for . this is one of the better horror anthologies i have seen . each story is genuinely eerie and suspenseful and i got shivers down my spine more than a few times . there is even a bit of humour in in of the stories . the only downside is the readily apparent low budget . still , the stories are effective enough and the acting superb . so the low budget isn't really a a huge problem . for me , From Beyond the grave is an
472980	11423174	70016	9.0	classic animated children's tale	this is a classic animated children's movie , but it also deals with the issue of dying and death , but in a tasteful way . kids will no doubt love it , with its abundance of songs / musical numbers . it's also funny at times . the movie could also be useful in improving young kids vocabulary and their spelling skills . of course , this would be lost on really young kids , but " older " young kids would benefit . another good thing about this movie is it teaches the value of friendship and working together . there is really nothing offensive at all here , though like i said the movie does deal with the issue of death and it might be a bit too intense for the really young . so parents should use their discretion , just to be on the safe side .
473379	11423174	96061	9.0	a modern contemporary update on " A Christmas Carol "	this is a delightful , well written movie . it's insanely funny with some good performances Bill Murray plays the " Scrooge " like character and is pitch perfect in the role . there are also some great supporting performances . who knew the classic " a Christmas Carol " could be updated with such hilarious results . this is a feel good movie or at least becomes one and after viewing , it is hard not to be uplifted . i actually liked it better than it's source material . i found it more effective . if you're looking for a profoundly impactful movie , this isn't it . it is a moving film , but also very fun at the same time . there is one very strongly moving moment in the movie , which brought tears to my eyes . in terms of entertainment , this one rates high . for me " Scrooged " is a
473693	11423174	82971	9.0	brilliant	wow . this movie is way better than i remembered to be . it's simply brilliant . the story is great , the action is terrific , there's lot of excitement and the film really moves along . even though the story was co-written by George Lucas , the dialogue is surprisingly not bad at all . Harrison Ford is Indian Jones , the main character , an archeology professor and archaeologist . i read once that Tom Selleck was up for the role , but could not get out of his contract with Magnum P . I . thank goodness , because i can't imagine anyone besides Ford in the role . Karen Allen co stars as Indy's former flame . there's also a tiny monkey in the movie , which gets a few laughs . finally , there is the great musical score by the great John Williams . this movie is put simply a blast .
473782	11423174	78748	9.0	rebirth of the sci-fi / horror genre	hmmm . here we have another example of classic , iconic movie , which is improved on by its sequel yes , the sequel is better , but that doesn't take away from the brilliance of this film . Alen is obviously a part of pop culture and well it should be . it revitalized the science fiction / horror genre , actually re-wrote the book . 1977's Star Wars of course redefined science fiction , but Alien was responsible for the re genesis of the horror / sci-fi combo . although released in 1979 , it still stands the test of time , and contains perhaps the most horrific scene in the genre to this day . the suspense factor is still very high to this day . the movie may seem a bit slow at times , but that is to build the suspense . this is not a " b " movie by any stretch of the imagination , though that might have been the intent at one point . the production values look very high even though the budget was tight . the film has a gritty , dirty feel to it . it looks very authentic . the reveal of the creature was well done . instead of giving too much away , you are shown bits at a time . when the creature is revealed it is something that hadn't been seen before , thanks to the genius of H . R . Geiger , who designed the look of the creature . Ridley Scott , of course , directed the film . if you haven't see Alien yet , you should . just be prepared to be patient , and remember it will be worth it in the end . my only complaint about this film is during the end scene when Ripley is about get into the cryo-stasis chamber . in this scene we see Ripley ( Sgourney Weaver ) wearing a pair of panties so undersized it is absurd . i'm not sure if this is supposed to be sexy , but it isn't at all . it is laughably ridiculous and sad . i suppose some teenage boys might be turned on by this , but i doubt it . someone really dropped the ball here . anyway , that is the only complaint . other than that , great movie . though like i said , the sequel improves upon it .
472985	11423174	758794	9.0	strong acting , but just a bit too long and a little slow at times	this is a pretty terrific movie . the acting is great there's tons of action , and there are even a few touches of lite humour . the movie is also very touching , and heartrending , especially near the beginning . it's hard to watch without becoming emotional since the movie is so intense . it's a true story about hope and faith and battling against the odds . but it doesn't hit you over the head with sentimentality , at least i didn't think so . there were probably some dramatic liberties taken to make the story more appealing for the contemporary audience , but i'm sure the gist of the story is accurate and intact . the only minor negative things i can say about this movie is that i felt it was too long and a bit slow at times . it can also be quite depressing , though that's too be expected due to the subject matter . still you prepare yourself for that . otherwise this is a movie well worth watching . i give We Are Marshall a strong
473646	11423174	58700	9.0	way better version than the recently released I am Legend ( )	this is the 1st filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel entitled I am legend . the 2nd film version ( which i have yet to see ) is called The Omega men , starring Charlton Heston . the 3rd version is the recently released film starring Will Smith , also entitled I am Legend , which i pretty much hated . as for this 1st version , starring Vincent Price , i thought it was fantastic . there are some great moments of suspense and a real sense of emptiness and desolation . Vincent Price is great here in a non villain role . you can really see the hopelessness and despair he feels . i thought the ending was very good . the only complaint i have about this particular version is it has a few slow moments . otherwise , though , like i said , it's fantastic .
472873	11423174	119819	9.0	woman dispatches fellow office workers , than just about everyone else in sight in black comedy , horror / suspense hybrid that is very effective	this movie is obviously about someone who kills people in the office . and we learn very quickly who the killer is , so i don't think it's possible to give too much away . Said killer is knebbish office worker Dorine Douglas ( Carol Kane ) . Douglas is a very lonely , insecure waif who lives with her overbearing mother . Douglas decides to begin killing people in her office , after witnessing one of her co-workers accidentally get killed . Douglas realizing she feels something akin to joy at his death . and she covers his death up . i should mention that most of her fellow workers treat her with disdain , or worse , even to the point of cruelty and hurtful remarks . so she feel justification for her feelings . soon , she dispatches another co-worker and then another . thing is , once she starts , she just keeps going and going and going . ( like the Energizer Bunny ) as the bodies mount up , Douglas also starts killing co-workers who are actually not that mean to her . and then , just about anyone she comes in contact with , she kills ( i mean anyone ) . I have to say that Cane does a very good job in the role . her character becomes quite gleeful of her work , treating it something akin to getting an A plus on a report card . ( you can tell Cane had a lot of fun with this role ) . she is a true sociopath , to be sure . and she engages in some very amusing rituals which i won't go into here . let's just say , you have to see it to believe it . so , what genre does this movie fall into ? well , horror , to be sure and suspense , and most prevalent , black comedy , very black . there are also a lot of intentional campy moments . some of the situations are so absurd and over the top , you have to laugh . this movie works on all levels and it proves you don't need a gi-normous ( gigantic / enormous ) budget to make a very effective movie . truly a unique piece of art .
473707	11423174	319262	9.0	Global warming , ice age , massive storms	global warming has finally caught up with us and in very sudden fashion causing massive storms including tornadoes and hurricanes , floods and tidal waves all at once , and a new global ice age in some places . i know , it sounds weird , global warming , ice age , but they sort of explain it in the movie . i am almost certain the science in the movie is flawed , but so what . there are some great special effects , great action and some suspense . put it all together , an you have on entertaining movie . Dennis Quaid plays climatologist Jack Hall , who must try and prevent the whole world from succumbing to the effects of global warming , and rescue his son , Sam ( Jake Gyllenall ) who , while on a school field trip becomes trapped in New York , which has become frozen solid in minutes . Emmy Rossum ( Mystic River ) plays Laura Chapman , one of Sam's classmates . Sela Ward plays Dr . Lucy Hall , Jack's wife . Ian Holm ( The Lord of the Rings , the fellowship of the ring , LOTR-the return of the King , Bilbo ) also stars . this movie has some breath taking moments to say the least . it is visually impressive . if you're looking for a fun ride , this is your movie .
473052	11423174	351283	9.0	riotously enjoyable animated romp	for me , this is a ridiculously funny animated adventure . i had a riot while watching . there's some great funny dialogue , some hysterical physical comedy . there is nothing subtle about this movie . they really hit you over the head with the comedy . but in this case , that's a good thing . but beyond comedy , there's also some adventure . the story is also good . the movie is well paced , and has a terrific mix of characters , each with their own quirky traits , who all seem to fit well together . the voice work is very good here . every character's voice fits perfectly . the film is rated G , which is appropriate , although here is some rude humour involved . as far as animated comedy / adventures , this is one of the best .
473445	11423174	76759	9.0	the landmark space fantasy	what can you say about his movie . it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged , and this was 1977 . i'm talking about the visual effects , which were nothing less than astounding . it still stands up well to any movie in that regard . remember , they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then , so they relied on miniatures . when you add to that , a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain ( not to mention , the colourful cast of characters ) and you have box office gold . sure , the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times , but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film . Besides , the film was marketed at 12 year olds , so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue . The original " Star Wars " or as it is subtitled " a New Hope , was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre . Obviously
473344	11423174	880578	9.0	thrilling and suspenseful	this is an outstanding movie , in my mind . Diane Lane plays a cyber-crimes investigator for the FBI , and Colin Hanks plays one of her co workers . Lane does a fantastic job ( which is not surprising given her talent ) and Hanks does pretty well also . the movie reminded me vaguely of Feardotcom , only this movie is way better . the suspense and tension are higher , the plot is is way better , and the acting is much better . i found the thrill level here pretty high throughout . Gregory Hoblit ( Frequency , Primal Fear , Fallen ) directed this movie . generally i find most of his movies pretty well made , and this was no exception . for me , this is one of the better suspense thrillers to come around in awhile . my vote for Untraceable is a
473055	11423174	95953	9.0	Hoffman is Brilliant and Cruise is also very good	i first saw this movie in high school , and recall feeling indifferent towards it . flash forward several years , and what a difference . this time around , i really liked it . for one , i paid more attention to it . i also liked it because Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic person was bang on . the reason i say this is because i work with an autistic individual . Hoffman must have done a lot of research for the role . either that , or he's a complete and utter genius . Tom Cruise is also good as the man who find out he has an autistic brother . Cruise's character ( Charlie Babbit ) goes from being an ego-centric materialistic and shallow human being , to someone who actually has compassion and doesn't just think of himself . Cruise makes the transformation very credible . i bought every minute of it . the story is fairly original , as far as i know , even today . there are also bits of lite humour sprinkled throughout , which don't detract from the quality of the film at all . for me , rain man is an
473378	11423174	107048	9.0	a bitter man find himself relieving the same day over and over again until he gets it right	this movie never loses it's charm and effect , even after repeated viewing . it's the story of a bitter , lonely arrogant , empty man ( Bill Murray ) who find himself reliving the same day ( Groundhog Day ) over and over again . each time he goes through he begins a slow transformation until he learns what life really means . he becomes a better man for the experience . Andie MacDowell plays the love interest and Chris Elliott put in a good supporting performance . also has this movie is at it's heart a life lesson movie , a morality fable , if you will . many of these types of movie are maudlin and inspirational ad naseum . not this one . it manages to avoid going down that route . i think this is due to the strong writing and direction . Danny Rubin wrote the story , and he and Harold Ramis co wrote the screen play . Ramis also directed the film . what's also good about this film are it's light comedic touches and even some flat out hilarious moments
472689	11423174	418279	9.0	ground breaking CGI ! ( )	i finally saw this movie in IMAX , and it was worth that wait . i enjoyed it for the most part . there are a few scenes i felt they didn't need , but overall , it's a pretty good movie . the story and the acting are not exactly profound or groundbreaking . but it is entertaining . however in my mind , The CGI in this movie is groundbreaking . the action scenes are some of the best i have seen . they are quite electrifying . i also really liked the look of the Transformers themselves . the special effects are seamless , in my opinion . i liked the humour in the film , especially involving The Transformers themselves . they also each had different personalities and quirks , so they weren't just two dimensional characters . in addition , it thought the voices for each of the Transformers fit the characters very well . the only negative i can think of is that the acting is a bit suspect , at times , but i won't get any more specific than that . otherwise , especially because of the outstanding CGI effects , it is still well worth watching . for me , Transformers is a
473184	11423174	320661	9.0	great movie , poor casting choice in lead role	Kingdom of Heaven is another Ridley Scott epic , set during the time of the Crusades in the 12th century , a time of war between the Christians and the Muslims . Orlando Bloom plays Balian , a humble blacksmith who ends up traveling to Jeruselum and ( inadvertently ) becomes defender of the city and its people . I really enjoyed this film . Scott shows again why he is so sought after as a director . the film contains epic battle scenes , is beautifully photographed and very well paced . there only a few minor problems with the film . one is the fact that a humble blacksmith with little if any training would become skilled warrior in the very limited time shown in the film . also the fact that this same man would then become leader of a nation . that seems a bit beyond the realm of plausibility . and the casting of Orlando bloom is really weak . He is not someone who would inspire confidence , mainly because he is too young and lacks the maturity for the role . the rest of the film is well done , very entertaining . again , it may not be historically accurate , but so what . you want historical accuracy , watch the History channel . you want an entertaining piece of cinema , watch this movie . normally a movie this well made would rate a perfect 10 , but due to the poor casting of Orlando Bloom , Kingdom of Heaven gets a
473491	11423174	452702	9.0	immensely entertaining	this is a great movie in the genre of suspense / thriller genre . it doesn't rely on blood and gore to be successful . rather , it relies on the build up of tension and suspense and succeeds very well in that aspect . this is a real pulse racer throughout much of it's short running time ( 85 minutes ) the film doesn't suffer from being as short as it is . it is very fast paced . there are a Few Blood curdling moments in this one . the two main characters are not overly developed , but we are given as much information as we need . the sense of danger and terror that the two main characters feel is really well articulated . you fell what they feel . at least , i did . one thing's for sure , a after watching this movie , i will think long and hard before checking into a motel in the middle of nowhere . Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are the two leads and are very convincing . Wilson really impressed me in a serious role . what the two are up against is frightening , to say the least . the supporting performances are also great . the movie is not necessarily original . it does borrow from other movies in the suspense / thriller genre and others . but it works so well with the material that that doesn't matter . i really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it .
473851	11423174	76666	9.0	" You're a cliché . You're nowhere , on your way to no place " ( )	i had never seen this movie before . though i had heard a lot of things about it . anyway , i finally watched it today , and i really liked it . i thought it was very well paced . i liked the dialogue . i thought it was clever . the acting was good , but Travolta was outstanding , but very understated . the dance scenes were really good . Travolta looked like natural on the dance floor . i also really liked the 70's disco music . the movie was written very well , overall . it felt really authentic . the only negative thing i can say about the movie , is that it loses some steam towards the end . but as for the ending itself , i liked it . it wasn't your typical Hollywood ending . i think it was realistic . in my opinion , pretty much anyone can relate to this movie , especially if your just an average person with big dreams . depending on your age , this movie might bring back a lot of memories for you . i think it's still relevant today . for me , Saturday Night Fever is a
473245	11423174	33457	9.0	what a gas !	what a riot this film is , once it gets going . the first 30 minutes are just the setup . from that point on , it's gas . Benny is hysterical in drag . i laughed my but off at his hi-jinks . i even had tears in my eyes at times . this is surely a classic . if not , it should be . Jack Benny of course takes centre stage here , but the supporting performances are very good , as well . it's based on a very successful stage play , but it translates well to the screen . it's also been made into a movie at least once before . if you're a Jack Benny fan , you can't afford to miss this gem . even if you're not a fan of Jack Benny , or don't even know who he is , you should catch this film for the great writing and the slapstick . and it's a good introduction to Benny . for me , Charley's Aunt is a
473890	11423174	102789	9.0	heart pounding action	i found this to be a very exciting , action packed movie , with a few good twists . Denzel Washington is great here as a rookie cop . John Lithgow is also very good here . Ice-T has a smaller role , but is also very good . look for Lindsay Wagner ( the original Bionic Woman ) in a supporting role . once the movie gets going it ( and it doesn't take long ) it keeps going . it's a real nerve shredder . i was glued from the get go . there's a lot more action than character development in this one , but you are given enough information on the characters to have some investment in them . if this movie doesn't get your blood pumping , i'd be very surprised . but then again , it's all a matter of opinion and taste . for me , though , i enjoyed every second of it .
473590	11423174	76578	9.0	fascinating look inside the world of bodybuilding ( specifically the 1975 Mr . Universe and Mr . Olympia competitions )	this a fascinating look behind the scenes of bodybuilders preparing for the 1975 Mr . Olympia and M . r Universe competitions . a lot of the focus is on Arnold Schwarzenegger and his chief rival Lou Ferigno as Arnold goes for his sixth Mr . Olympia title . the documentary shows the lengths the contenders are willing to go to win the contest , and how intelligent these guys are . the impact of this film on the bodybuilding and fitness world is immense , and its impact is still felt today . as i was watching the documentary , it struck me how vain you would have to be to enter these contests . back then there wasn't a lot of money involved . there was only glory . there was a lot of work involved just to be in shape to compete , so the discipline must have been off the charts . anyway , not only did i enjoy this film , i also found it informative and enlightening . for me , Pumping Iron is a
473071	11423174	87078	9.0	even better than the original ( despite the casting blunder of Grace Jones ) shudder	this sequel to " Conan The Barbarian " is a pretty decent movie , in my mind . it has as much action as the first one , but the story is better in my opinion . it is a bit hard to follow . at least i thought it was . the tone of the movie seems lighter than the first , and there is more humour . i also liked the fact the " Conan " was shown as being human , and not invincible . i thought his main adversary was a great choice for the strength of Conan and he could not beat it by brawn alone . there are also some great characters for Conan's traveling companions , who actually were very helpful to Conan . the one thing i did not like is the inclusion of Grace Jones . to me , the woman is much too scary to be on any screen or even seen by the public . i thought she added nothing to the movie and her role was pointless . she also scares the sht out of me . however , i thought the movie was good enough to overcome that huge casting blunder . in fact , in spite of that fact , in my opinion " Conan The Destroyer " manages to be a better movie than the first Conan movie . this is just my opinion of course . For me , " Conan The Destroyer " is an
473653	11423174	430154	9.0	outstanding short film	this short film is actually a mock trailer for a film that doesn't actually exist . after watching Grayson , i wished the movie did exist . hopefully , it will get made some day . anyway , the story is about Dick Grayson ( the original Robin ) and his quest for vengeance after the death of his friend BruceWayne / Batman . i liked the story , and the acting is first rate here , as is the writing . i liked the characterization of each person involved . the film is actually very exciting . in fact , when it was over , i wanted more . there are many famous DC characters that make cameo appearances , which was a nice touch . the effects were good , considering the budget . it's obvious , that all involved in the making of this film put their hearts into it , and it shows . for me , Grayson is a
473562	11423174	432348	9.0	better than the first , and that's saying a lot	if you liked saw , you will really like saw 2 . it improves upon the original , surprisingly . there were more characters and the setting has changed slightly . whereas in the original , most of the story takes place in one room , there are now more rooms . the traps are more inventive than the original , there is more action and a group dynamic going on , setting the stage for a sort of mob mentality among some of the characters . this time we have a new group of characters . in this bunch there are some truly evil individuals , lumped in with some that are not . this is , good as it allows you to play some characters off each other . you still have your sympathetic characters to root for , and you also have the others that you can hope meet a grisly end . of course , the original villain is back and one other character from the original also returns . there is a higher budget this time around , hence a more polished look to the film , which works here . there is a twist ending , which was a bit of a surprise , setting up the soon to be released saw 3 nicely . and there is also a healthy dose of gore . what else can i say ? saw 2 is highly recommended . if you haven't seen it , what are you waiting for ?
473339	11423174	952640	9.0	it's all about family	i loved this movie . it ' s mostly live action , except tor the chipmunks . they are CG animated . if you're feeling down , this movie should pick up your spirits . i found it hysterically funny at times . i think adults will love it as much as kids . it's a movie appropriate for the whole family , in my mind . there's nothing offensive , that i could see . there also a message in the movie , though it's very subtle . or maybe it's not that subtle . i guess it depends on the person . really , family and doing the right thing are the most important things . at least that's what came across for me . beyond that , though , i found the movie a riot , and it's really sweet and touching . i highly recommend it .
472820	11423174	144214	9.0	a powerful movie about murder , cover up and conspiracy with a military backdrop	this is a movie of murder , mystery and intrigue set against the back drop of a military base . i found this movie very riveting and engaging , although very disturbing . it's quite graphic in it's depiction of violence . i liked the fact that you never really know who the bad guys are until the end . there are a lot of twists and turns , with clues ( and anti clues ) along the way . naturally , having a military setting , there is of course a cover up afoot by certain individuals who want the truth to remain untold . the movie also has holds some surprising and explosive revelations . John Travolta stars in this one , along with Madeline Stowe , Timothy Hutton and James Cromwell . i'm not really a Travolta fan , but he's OK in this movie as the lead investigator assigned to the case . Stowe plays his partner of sorts , and handles her role well . Cromwell is the top ranking General whose daughter is the focal point of the mystery . Hutton plays a high ranking Colonel whose allegiance hard to pin down . i really got into this movie and stayed riveted to the end . The General's Daughter gets a from me .
473164	11423174	440963	9.0	third in the Bourne trilogy the best of the series so far	i'm gonna go out on a limb here , and say that this third Film in the Bourne franchise is at least as good as the last Bond Film , Casino Royale it may even be better than some of the older Sean Connery Bonds . this movie left me breathless . there's no time to get bored while watching this film . the action scenes are intense and frenetic . the fight scenes are even better than in the Bourne identity and Bourne Supremacy , and that's saying a lot . this is the fist Bourne movie i have seen on the big screen , and it's worth every penny . if you get a chance to see to go see it in the theatre , you should do so . anyway , Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne , and is even more convincing here than in the previous two , which is also saying a lot . again we also have a strong supporting cast . there isn't as much drama in this one , in fact very little . this movie does strain believability a bit more than the two previous film , but it is escapist entertainment . i think this movie is the best so far of the Bourne Trilogy , which , again , is saying a lot . for me , The Bourne Ultimatum is a .
473008	11423174	322330	9.0	high energy fun	i liked the original Freaky Friday ( 1976 ) starring a teenage Jodi Foster and Barbara Harris . i thought it was sweet , touching , and funny . this updated version is also really good . it's much higher energy than the original version . the acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan is superb as they play role reversal , Curtis playing the role of the 15 year old daughter Anna , and Lohan playing th role of her mother Tess , while still in their original bodies . of course Anna and her mother have nothing in common , so living in each other's bodies is a real wakeup call . besides the central premise , the movie is formulaic . still . it's fun watching Lohan and Curtis trying to navigate the other one's life . naturally there's a lesson involved , and mom and daughter finally begin to understand each other . anyway really liked it .
472667	11423174	437179	9.0	a fun , thrilling slasher flick	i really enjoyed See No Evil . it has some disgusting moments , and it also has some heart pumping moments . it has one really inventive kill , and a great villain played by Kane . Kane is not your garden variety psychopath . for one thing , he is massive and very imposing . Kane has very good screen presence and he makes a terrific villain . and this villain has something many villains in todays movies of this genre lack . he has a personality . and though his actions are sick and twisted , the movie does reveal his motivation for doing what he does , though admittedly not until the latter stages of the movie . finally , a villain who is not just another mindless killing machine . you actually feel some sympathy for him . i also really liked the setting . and there is one good twist in the movie that i figured out just before it is revealed , but up until that point i had no idea . i thoroughly enjoyed this movie . out of 10
472739	11423174	146336	9.0	creative premise , compelling storyline , and strong , likable characters	i'm amazed at the low rating for this movie ( ) i though this was a great movie . it intelligently written , compelling and most of all unpredictable . but it also has strong , likable characters . sure , it borrows from other movies . but the actual general premise is unique , as far as i know . this movie kept me guessing right to the very end . . that to me , says it's well written . you have a lot of people to choose from who could be the killer , and they all have their reasons . is is scary ? no , but it is creepy and eerie and it does keep you interested . i really felt for some of the characters who were killed , which says something . i'n sure there are plot holes and inconsistencies , just like most movies . however , they are not as obvious in this movie . you really have to look for them . if a movie has blatant flaws that you can see miles away , that's different . the point is , in my mind , this is a great movie . i give " Urban Legends " a
473232	11423174	166396	9.0	wacky little independent movie	this little movie is another example that you don't need a big budget with big special effects . all you need is a compelling story . and some humour , courtesy of some wacky characters and situations , doesn't hurt . this movie has all of that . it is hysterically funny at times , and always entertaining . this is a UK / France / USA production , although how equal each countries participation is , could be up for debate . i say this because the Brits are very good at making this type of movie work , without being depressing understand that to be funny , a movie actually needs comedy . most small American made films are usually depressing ( at least the one i've had the misfortune of sitting through ) maybe that's a requirement . As for the French , i haven't seen to many of their films , if any . the point is , this is a very good film in all aspects . sometimes i laughed so hard , i cried . and yes , the title is actually relevant to the movie , though i won't say how . check this little gem out . you won't be disappointed .
473661	11423174	257360	9.0	a thought provoking and enriching experience	i loved this movie . it's touching , funny and ironic . the title character played by Jack Nicholson is so likable , you can't help but root for him . and Nicholson really tones down his bigger than life " Jack " persona . there's no over the top scenery chewing here . his performance is very subtle and understated , and doesn't overshadow the supporting cast . the basic gist of the story is that Warren Schmidt has just retired , and ends up on a cross country journey that changes his life . along the way he discovers himself and meets some interesting characters , which provide some comic relief . there is strong supporting cast here , including Kathy Bates ( Misery ) Hope Davis , Dermot Mulroney and Howard Hesseman . not to sound maudlin , but this was a very and thought provoking and enriching experience . for me , About Schmidt is a well deserved
473597	11423174	395378	9.0	very entertaining	once in a while there is a reality TV show that is real and is worth watching . in this case , it happens to be Airline . it's basically a day in the life of the employees at a major airline in the states , and the things they deal with on a daily basis . it's very interesting to see the different types of people they have to put up with . these include drunk people who are not allowed on the plane until they sober up . i found it really entertaining watching these people try to say they're not drunk . they also have to deal with belligerent passengers who don't show up on time for their flight and have a fit saying they will sue . but it's not all negative . there's some fun stuff , as well , like the staff Christmas parties , retirement parties and such . the point ids , this is a very entertaining and sometimes very funny 30 minute show . it's also very enlightening . it really shows you what the employees have to deal with on a daily basis , all the while keeping their cool . the show only lasted two and a half seasons , which is a shame . i think this is one of the better shows out there . i give Airline a
473146	11423174	443680	9.0	well written and well acted	this is more than just a movie about the killing of Jesse James . the story is about the event leading up to the title and the aftermath . it's a well done movie with great performances from Brad Pitt as James , Sam Rockwell as Charlie Ford , and Casey Affleck as Robert Ford . the supporting performances are also very good . this is not an action film , but a deliberately paced character study . the film is well written and has some very good dialogue . it also has a voice over narration , which i thought worked well with this movie . it does tend a bit toward slowness , but only for brief moments and only occasionally , and is never boring . the story and characters are quite compelling . i found myself quite engrossed in the story and the characters . for me , The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a
473403	11423174	410650	9.0	AAA movie . Wow ! ! !	for a straight to video movie , this one is really pretty good . it is darker in tone than the first one ( we won't mention the unfortunate second one ) and their is more of a sense of jeopardy and doom . it takes the intensity of the first one and brings it to a whole new level . we get a good reveal of the sinister alien in this one , and it really looks well done . this is a very smartly written film , with lots of action and some pretty cool kills . the story is better than the first " Species " with some added dimensions . the acting isn't really that great , but that's not really the main focus here . that belongs to the alien creature , played by Sunny Mabrey . if you're a guy , you better have a bucket with you , because you'll drool all over the place when you see this chick . as for the movie itself , i think it's better than the original . for me , " Species 3 " is a
473483	11423174	183718	9.0	a boxing movie that's about much more than boxing	this is a really good movie about boxer Rocky Marciano . it chronicles his rise to greatness in the sport . but more than that , it chronicles his and his family's struggle to overcome adversity and prejudice . the film shows Marciano as a ( at most times ) humble man who longs to escape the dead end path he is on , with a bleak future and a menial job in which he is fated to merely eke out an existence . the movie is low key and doesn't not put boxing on a pedestal , but rather shows that that their are people behind those gloves and bruises . it also shows the despicable people behind the scenes ( slimy managers and promoters , etc ) and the udder depths they will stoop to in order to keep their fighters under their thumbs . Jon Favreau puts in a terrific performance as the title character , while both Judd Hirsch and Tony Lo Bianca both portray ( very convincingly ) a scumbag manager and an even scummier promoter , respectively George C . Scott plays Marciano's father , whose fate in life Marciano hopes to escape from . this is obviously not a documentary , so there is probably some liberty taken by the filmmakers . but i'm sure a lot of the movie was accurate , especially about the scumbags behind the scenes . in fact , we have one high profile one in the real life boxing world , though haven't heard too much from him lately . we all know who he is and that he's nothing but a waste of skin . anyway , i feel this is a movie that most people , even non boxing fans will enjoy and relate to . for me " Rocky Marciano " is a
472877	11423174	106004	9.0	Dry , witty sarcastic ( all in a good way ) TVseries revolving around 2 snooty psychiatrist brothers in Seattle	Frasier is about 2 psychiatrist brothers , Frasier Crane ( Kelsey Grammar ) and Niles Crane ( David Hyde Pierce ) . but these 2 are not your average psychiatrists . they are upper crust snobs , especially Niles . the show is a spin off of cheers . Frasier has moved from Boston to Seattle and is the host of this own very popular radio program However , many times it is his producer Roz Doyle ( Perri Gilpin ) who dispenses more realistic down to earth advice than Frasier would . She also gets Frasier out of a lot of jams . there are few eccentrics at the radio station , each with their own quirks and oddities . on the home front Frasier livers with his dad , Marty Crane ( John Mahoney ) who has just recently moved in for reasons i won't disclose . of course , things do not always run smoothly between the 2 . the show uses dry , witty sarcasm as humour ( in an upper crust sort of way ) which most people will get . there are also many misunderstandings , leading to some very amusing situations . there is one running gag to do with Niles , which is also quite amusing . Frasier is not the " howling with laughter " kind of show , though it does have those moments . it is more subtle and high brow than many comedies . it is however , immensely entertaining . unfortunately though most of the episodes worked , on occasion there were some that fell flat throughout its 11 year run . as a result , i would have to give Frasier a rather than 10 .
473667	11423174	404032	9.0	Jennifer Carpenter ( as Emily ) is astonishing	this movie definitely has some blood curdling moments . the story is basically this : a catholic priest is on trial for causing the death of a young girl eh performed an exorcism on , claiming she was possessed . however , the authorities believe he caused her death . through flashbacks , we see the events leading up to that point , including the possession of Emily Rose ( Jeniffer Carpenter ) . Laura Linney is the Lawyer who takes on the case . Tom Wilkinson is the priest . and Campbell Scott is the prosecuting attorney . but there's more than this to the story . the movie has some similarities to An American Haunting , which came out the same year . this movie has a better , more developed story though , and the acting is better . Jeniffer Carpenter in particular , is astonishing . for me , The Excorism of Emily Rose is a
472558	11423174	89034	9.0	well done Gothic horror	i really enjoyed this movie . i found it very stylish and atmospheric . i liked the dull , dreary look of the film . it was very appropriate in this case . i also liked the setting : Edinburg , Scotland in 1820 . this movie was adapted from an original Screenplay by the poet Dylan Thomas . the script was written by Ronald Harwood . to me , this movie felt like something that Edgar Allen Poe would have written . i mean that in a good way . the general premise of the movie is as follows : Doctor Thomas Rock ( Timothy Dalton ) is an anatomy instructor at a local school . he is supplied his cadavers , or dead bodies , via the deaths of convicts who have been executed . however , two petty criminal lowlifes , named Timothy Broom ( Stephen Rea ) and Robert Fallon ( Johnathon Pryce ) find out they can profit by bringing bodies to the Doctor themselves and getting paid . from there , things begin to take a disturbingly chilling turn , but i won't reveal more . anyway , for me , this a genuine old fashioned ghost story that really works . there's no gore to speak of , but plenty of tension and suspense and some chills . if this seems like your bag , you might want to give " The Doctor and the Devils " a try . for me
472598	11423174	117731	9.0	awesome ! ! !	for my money , this eight movie in the Star Trek franchise is the best of the eight . i just think it's got a great story , with a good subplot . the acting is good . the action sequences are really good . i also really like the look of the Enterprise in this movie . it so sleek and beautiful . also , the villain is quite strong , a worthy adversary for the Enterprise and her crew . there's also some humour here , which is always nice and some character growth and development . this is the first of The Next Generation movies and it is awesome . actually this movie blew me away with how good it is . there are also a boat load of extras on this second disc which make this edition more than the worth the purchase price , in my mind . easily
473216	11423174	109890	9.0	lots of action in this 1	wow . lots of action , some brutal violence , even some black comedy thrown into the mix . oh , yeah , also some steamy love scenes and some double crosses . that pretty much describes " The Getaway " . for me , all this is a good thing . at least , it works in this movie . there's a great cast , who all put in great performances . Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger play the two lead characters , with great supporting work from Micheal Madsen , James Woods , Jeniffer Tilly and Richard Farnsworth . if you like a action packed movie and don't mind brutal violence and nudity or foul language ( there's a lot of that in here ) you should enjoy this 1 . as an added bonus , there are a couple of twists and , like i mentioned earlier , some black humour . myself , i really had a good time with this movie . i give " The Getaway "
472835	11423174	373926	9.0	well acted , well directed , well written suspense thriller	Sidney Pollack's The interpreter is a well made film . i wasn't expecting much , so this was a pleasant surprise . the movie stars Nicole Kidman as U . N interpreter who overhears a murder plot and Sean Penn Plays a secret service agent assigned to protect her . Normally i don't like Nicole Kidman , however she showed she has some real range in this picture . Sean Penn is terrific in understated performance . the film is well directed , with plenty of suspense , intense action sequences and some good plot twists . the dramatic moments are also handled well by Pollack . Pollack has directed several films in his career , such as Tootsie , out of Africa and the Firm , as well as Random Hearts and Sabrina . Thespeople responsible for the writing must also be given credit as well foe a superb effort . Overall , a very well done effective suspense thriller .
473394	11423174	1259998	9.0	very strong animated feature from Marvel ( )	this is one of the latest Marvel animated features , and i gotta say , i liked it . this one involves the children of the Original Avengers , most of which do not appear in the story . i won't say why . you'll have to watch to find out . anyway , i found the premise of the future an interesting concept . but there is more to the story than just the children . i mentioned earlier that mos of the original Avengers do not appear , but one or two do show up to lend a hand . i liked the fact that in this feature , the threat to humanity is very grave , with a very strong and powerful villain . there's some great character interaction here , as well , including some conflict among the heroes . and for action fans , there are some great action scenes , including some great hand to had combat fighting . beyond that , i really like the colour scheme of the movie . , and i thought the voice castling was very good , especially , the voice of the villain . it was truly an inspired choice . my vote for The Next Avengers :
472790	11423174	387114	9.0	terrific independent movie	to me , this movie proves that you don't need a huge budget and big special effects to be successful . this is an independent Canadian movie . i found it to be funny , entertaining and dramatic . i liked the hockey scenes , and the scenes in the locker room . the end result may or may not be realistic , but so what . the movie was charming and well written . the acting was very good from all involved , as far as a i could tell . many of the actors are probably people that many of us haven't seen too much of if at all , but that does not take away from their performances at all . i thought these performers were as good as many so called " great " Hollywood actors . this is what i would consider a great family movie , with maybe a few scenes of minor language , and nothing offensive , but parents should always use their discretion . for me " Anyone's Game " ( AKA " Chicks With Sticks " ) is a
473069	11423174	119718	9.0	vastly entertaining and downright funny at times	i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site . I'll admit it's no masterpiece , but it is vastly entertaining . to me , Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr . Magoo . if you don't know the character of Mr . Magoo , he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted , leading him into all kinds of trouble , yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on . oh yeah , he is also very wealthy . the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same . he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem . in the movie , Magoo , helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail , with a lot of help , from both his nephew and his dog . yes , i said dog . this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps , both minor and major . Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role . not to mention she is hot , hot , hot . anyway , like i said earlier , the movie is certainly very amusing , and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen . there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves , courtesy of Lynch's character . for the most part , this is a great family movie , with maybe a bit of mild language . for me , the live action version of Mr . Magoo is an , based simply on how entertaining it is .
473235	11423174	265662	9.0	great family movie from Disney	this a great Disney flick . it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach ( Dennis Quaid ) , who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher , but suffered a career ending injury . but through series of events , Jimmy Morris ( Quaid ) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster . this is a great family film . it is inspirational , but doesn't pour it on too thick . it's fun and entertaining . adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids . it is based upon a true story , though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story . Quaid is sensational as the title character , very convincing . if you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy , look no further .
473210	11423174	443543	9.0	romance , mystery , suspense all add up to a very good movie	i liked this movie a lot . i thought the acting was very good . Jessica Biel really impressed me in her role . she really brought some depth to her character , and proved that she definitely has talent . she held her own against some real heavyweights in the film . i also liked the setting of Vienna sometime in the 19th century , i believe . i think Vienna is really appropriate , because , to me it seems like it would be a romantic city . the movie has a romantic air to it , but it is also a mystery / suspense film . i thought the story was also very good , and well told . the characters had some dimension to them , at least i think they did . i liked the ending , even though it was anti-climatic . it fit with the rest of the movie . by that i mean it all makes sense at the end , but you have to think about it a bit . if you enjoy movies that are challenging , and if you are a bit of a romantic , ( even if you're not ) you will probably like " The Illusionist " . for me , this movie is about
473496	11423174	253754	9.0	Equal to First Contact as the best of all the Star Trek films	This third ( and presumably final , but who knows ? ) voyage for the crew of The Next Generation , is , in my mind , arguably the best of the Star Trek Series . the only movie that may rival it is First Contact . as for Nemesis , it has everything it requires to be a great film . first there's a decent dose of humour . there are definitely some spectacular space action sequences . the villain is once again , a strong character . there's a bit of romance ( but not too much ) and the movie is quite touching at times . but it never becomes sappy or maudlin . the suspense level is pretty high in this one . the tension reaches nail biting proportions at times . but there is one difference in this Trek movie , as compared to the other ones . that is its dark ( or darker ) tone . there's a much more sinister feel to this one . the film manages to blend all these elements seamlessly . the ending is surprising , and appropriate , i feel . for me , this movie is a
473402	11423174	102070	9.0	a laugh riot in all the right ways	here i sit , shaking my head in bewilderment . why , you say ? well , i'm glad you asked . here it is - - the low rating ( ) for this movie . i thought this movie was an absolute riot . funny doesn't begin to describe this film . the movie is very well written . the dialogue is top notch ( though many people will disagree with me on that point ) and there are some great one liners . i think the genius of the film is that it takes what some people may think is bad dialogue and makes it good . this is a deliberately funny movie . it's not one of those " so bad it's good " movies . of course it isn't just funny . it's also full of action . now , even though this movie has a low rating , and most critics panned it , many filmmakers must have found some merit in it . how else do you explain that fact that this movie is often referenced in later movies ? i'm pretty sure this is what you would call a cult classic . you won't find any deep profound meaning here , but it's a truly entertaining romp . for me , " Hudson Hawk " is a
473343	11423174	758730	9.0	all over the map , but i still enjoyed it	i liked this particular . movie , even though somewhere along the line , it becomes many different movies . it's a teenage slasher flick , with some Red dawn thrown in the mix . the characters suddenly become either Rambo , or Ripley , from the original Alien series . the plot twist are telegraphed a mile away . i will admit there are some pretty exciting scenes , and my adrenaline was pretty high at times . there are many more fight scenes between the two title characters . and even though the movie is all over the place , i still enjoyed it . the theatrical version of this film was rated R or 18A in Canada , and the unrated version ( which i watched ) promised more gore and scenes too shocking for theatres . honestly though , many TV shows are just as graphic and violent and usually have a 14A rating . it really bugs me when studios come out with these unrated versions with scenes too shocking for theatres . i have yet too see any unrated movie contain any scenes too shocking for theatres . too me , this is a cheap marketing gimmick and false advertising . anyway , back to the movie . despite it's problems , i still enjoyed it immensely . for me , AVPR : Alien vs Predator-Requiem is a
472966	11423174	75148	9.0	classic underdog story	Rocky is by now considered a classic movie , and well it should be . if you like underdog stories , you will love this movie . i won'y go to much into the plot , except to say this is a story of an unknown boxer who hits the big time when he gets the chance the fight the current world champion . Sylvester Stallone wrote the script and starred as rocky . the underdog theme in the movie mirror Stallone's life somewhat , as he was down and out prior to the film . Stallone shot to stardom after Rocky , becoming a household name . anyway , as for the movie itself , the story is well developed and the characters are well written . the dramatic moments are well done as are the action scenes . the movie is very inspiring , but stops short of being maudlin . you really care about Rocky and want him to succeed . more than a movie , Rocky has become a part of pop culture and will likely remain so for a long time to come . a strong
473109	11423174	117438	9.0	loaded with suspense and tension	i liked this movie . it has some edge of your seat moments , and great acting . while the acting is credible , i'm not sure how realistic the actions of some of the characters are . there is a twist which i figured out right away , the first time i watched it . i think that's because it just seemed so obvious . nevertheless , the movie fun is fun , and thrilling , and action packed right to the end . Mel Gibson puts in a strong performance as does Gary Sinise . Rene Russo is also good , but has a small role . i also liked Delroy Lindo . i thought he was good in his role . interestingly , the Laser disc version of the film is 139 minutes , according to this site , while this version is only 121 minutes . i'm curious about the missing 17 minutes . anyway , for me , Ransom is an
472827	11423174	117381	9.0	stunning performance by Edward Norton	this is one of the best murder mystery , psychological suspense films i have ever seen . this thing will keep you riveted and guessing right down to the end . this movie belongs to Edward Norton , who plays an alter boy accused of murdering a priest . this is an early film with Norton , in fact his first feature ( big screen ) film . his talent is undeniable even back then ( 1996 ) . there a lot of layers to this movie and a lot going on . there are also a lot of plot twists and some red herrings ( false clues ) to help lead you to the wrong conclusions . Richard Gere is also in the film and he does good in his role , as does Laura Linney in her role . but like i said , this is an Edward Norton film . the success of the movie hinges on his performance . he delivers in a big way , so the film succeeds . i don't think you can go wrong with this film . i urge you to check it out . for me " Primal Fear " is a
473389	11423174	104431	9.0	round 2 ( )	Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same general plot as the first one . a few of the particulars have changed , including the location . this time Kevin is Lost in New York , while his family is somewhere else . the 2 bumbling Robbers , Marv ( Daniel Stern ) and Harry ( Joe Pesci ) return and of course meet up with Kevin and slapstick ensues . this movie is a bit longer , and i felt it took a while to get going , but once it does , it's very funny . the booby traps Kevin designs are just as elaborate and cause a lot of pain and grief for Harry and Marv , and a lot of hilarity for the audience . this movie is a bit more touching and heartwarming than the first one , and at least as funny . the only downside for me is the slow beginning . otherwise , it pretty much lives up to the first one . for me , Home Alone 2 Is an
473048	11423174	163978	9.0	check out the novel by Alex Garland	this is one intense movie going experience . i don't wanna give too much away , but it has echoes of Lord of the Flies . if i'm not mistaken it's also similar to King Rat . it's directed by Danny Boyle ( Train Spotting , 28 days Later ) and Stars Leonardo DiCaprio , Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle . anyway , there's some great acting here . Tilda Swinton in particular impressed me . the dialogue is also well written . really the whole movie is well written . plus there is a high element of suspense and danger . it's based on a novel by Alex Garland , but i haven't read the novel , so i can't compare . i may just try to find the novel , so i can compare . as a movie though it's quite well done . for me , The Beach is an
472770	11423174	476964	9.0	Terrific performances from Jodi Foster and Terrence Howard	this movie was much better than i had hoped or expected it to be . it basically turns the vigilante genre on its head , and has a female character as the vigilante . like any vigilante movie , it certainly poses tough questions . it contains some terrific performances in it's two lead characters , Jodi Foster as the vigilante , and Terrance Howard as the cop on her trail . both are outstanding and very credible in their respective roles . Foster really makes you sympathetic to her character and rooting for her , even though you probably shouldn't . Howard's character is also sympathetic , because he has mixed feelings , but has to follow the law . he comes off very convincingly as someone who is conflicted . the movie is well paced and appropriately dark . even before the end of the movie , i thought it was well done , but the ending caught me totally off guard . it elevated the movie a notch . for me , The Brave One is a
473772	11423174	343135	9.0	insanely funny at times	this is one terrific little movie . it's a romantic comedy starring Ben stiller and Jeniffer Aniston . in this case , though , the emphasis is more on comedy than romance . there are some hysterical sequences in this movie , some courtesy of Stiller and Aniston , bit some also due to the supporting cast . there are also a couple of running gags in the movie , which never get old . as for the supporting cast , Philip Seymour Hoffman is a riot in many of his scenes . Alec Baldwin and Bryan Brown also provide some laughs . however , it is Hank Azaria , along with another character , who steal the show . Azaria is pee your pants funny . i won't reveal the identity of the other character here . Aniston and Stiller have great general and comedic chemistry and great comedic timing here . Debra Messing is also good , but i wish her role had been more substantial . anyway , if you want a movie that will make you forget about the world for about 90 minutes , this might be your movie . give it a shot . for me , Along Came Polly is an
473463	11423174	71315	9.0	I have now seen 2 first rate Polanski films	Well , i never thought i'd say this , but , i have now seen 2 very good Roman Polanski movies . ( the other being the brilliant " The Ninth Gate " ) anyway , Chinatown is a simple story of private eye Jake Gittes , who stumbles into a murder mystery . Jack Nicholson plays Gittes , in a brilliantly understated performance . Nicholson makes Gittes into a very likable character . The film has a very unique and impressive visual style . Polanski's direction is very tight and economical . everything fits and each scene has relevance to the film . This is not an action movie , but more of character study , and is also very dialogue driven . What action there is , is low key and passive . this is no criticism of the movie , at all . it is so well written that it cannot fail to hold your interest , and as director , Polanski Tties everything up neatly . Faye Dunaway also plays a prominent role in the movie , delivering a very good performance . The only thing i didn't like was the ending . i don't mean to say it was bad ending , i had just hoped it would have gone in a different direction . the screenplay was written by Robert Towne , and Polanski himself had a hand in the screenplay , but is not credited . The screenplay is responsible for a great deal of the film's success , but this is clearly a team effort . All in all , Chinatown is a well crafted movie from all involved .
473464	11423174	162661	10.0	Ichabod Crane vs The headless Horseman	Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful film . it is very atmospheric , visually stunning and very creepy . Tim Burton does a wonderful job of directing here . this a very well paced film with excellent acting performances from all . the great Johnny Depp plays the role of Ichabod Crane , a very quirky police investigator who , due to his radical theories , is banished to the remote village of Sleepy hollow . Once there it is his job to solve the mysterious murders supposedly perpetrated by the Headless Horseman . the movie is set in the latter half of the 18th century . The supporting cast all put in great performances . This a movie that will disturb you and keep you enraptured by it's beautiful visual style . Sleepy Hollow is also a movie of substance . Burton recreates the time and place very authentically . Though Burton can be hit and miss with his films , he hits the mark with this one .
473266	11423174	167404	10.0	a modern psychological suspense masterpiece	i'm not going to give much of the plot of this one away , just in case you're one of the three people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie . suffice to say that it is one of the greatest psychological suspense thrillers in modern time . this is one eerie movie , strongly anchored by the performance of Haley Joel Osment . , who plays the character to which the title refers . Bruce Willis and Toni Collette also put in strong performances . and watch for a brilliant performance from an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg ( yes that Donnie Wahlberg from " New Kids on the Block " fame ) . who knew he could act ? you will almost certainly have to watch this movie more than once , and you will discover something new each time . if you have'nt seen it , and somehow have managed to avoid knowing anything about it , i highly recommend it . to end , i will just say that this movie is a modern Masterpiece . 10 + + + / 10
473358	11423174	44008	10.0	arguably the best version of the story	there are several filmed version of this movie , ( and though i admit i haven't seen the other versions ) this is arguably the most famous filmed version of The Charles Dickens classic , and Alistair is arguably the definitive Scrooge . Alistair Sim is wonderful as Scrooge , the men old miser who's heart changes for the better one Christmas Eve . Sim's transformation from grumpy , people , hating , Christmas hating tightwad to a lovable kind hearted joy filled man is astonishing . i had a tear or two in my eye before it was over . the story is obviously one of redemption and , hope and love , and there's a lesson in that for all of us . my vote for a Christmas Carol , AKA Scrooge , is a
473128	11423174	372784	10.0	one of the best superhero movies ever made	Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made . the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader . obviously , there is a fair amount of character development involved , which you would expect based on the title . but not so much that the film becomes tedious . Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations . this version is also more faithful to the comic . Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director , pacing the film very well . there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne . The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre , instead of simply being devices for the hero ( the protagonist ) to have a villain ( antagonist ) to defeat . Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles , as is Liam Neeson . Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role , so she is a bit weak . This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts , and is closer to the realm of realism ( relatively speaking ) the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance . in fact more substance than style , though it is just stylistic enough . All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader . this movie sets the bar high for its successor , the Dark Knight , which is to be released sometime in 2008 .
473662	11423174	106856	10.0	a social commentary on our times ( with a searing performance by Michael Douglas )	wow . this movie blew me away . it was relevant then , and it even more relevant today . Michael Douglas gives a searing performance as an ordinary man who has a really bad day , and explodes under the pressure . his character is someone anyone who lives in the big city can relate to and feel empathy for . not only does the film examine what happens when an ordinary is pushed past the breaking limit , it also examines the ramification of that person's action and the effect on that person and others . it also shows how silly we have gotten as a society , with all of our ridiculous ways of doing business . it's almost as if things are set up deliberately for someone to lose control . Joel Schumacker ( Phonebooth ) directed this movie and although i'm not generally a fan , he impressed me here . i also liked the writing and the dialogue . the supporting cast are also good , but this is Douglas's show . to , me this is a career making performance . a masterpiece , if i've ever seen one . 10 + + + / 10
472961	11423174	91326	10.0	sequel improves on original	once again we have a case where the sequel outdoes the original . the original set the stage for the characters and is well done . however , the sequel is better than the original for one main reason , a better villain . this time Daniel is forced to fight for his life ( literally ) against a much more skilled opponent than he faced in the original . there is much more tension in this movie and more scenes of peril . the violence is more vivid and graphic . The setting is much more exotic , this time Okinawa being where most of the story takes place . so , visually we have a much more picturesque movie to look at . also , we see some of the culture of the people of Okinawa ( accurate or not , i'm not sure ) . there is also more happening in this film . we have a subplot involving Mr . Myagi and a choice he must make . so , the story is more developed , the location is nicer , and the villain is better written than the 1st . and of course Mr . Myagi continues to teach Wisdom to Daniel as well as the Okinawan Village . when you add it all up , this makes for a better movie . but parents should be warned , again , that their is more graphic violence and sequences of peril in this one . use your discretion .
473094	11423174	32551	10.0	A John Ford classic	grapes of Wrath is the story of a family who is forced to leave their Oklahoma Farmstead due to the great depression . they leave everything behind , and head for California , where the men hope to work and the family can make a go of things . things don't go as smoothly as they'd hoped , of course . the movie details the struggles they go through . the movie is based on the novel by John Steinbeck ( Of Mice and Men ) while the screenplay is written by Nunnally Johnson ( the Dirty Dozen ) . John Ford ( The Searchers , Cheyenne Autumn ) directs . Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad , on of the sons in the family , and the unofficial leader . the acting in this movie is superb from all concerned , and the movie is also well written . it's not an action movie at all , but a story and dialogue driven piece . i didn't find it slow at all , due in large part to John Ford's direction , the great acting and strong writing . it's sad at times , but never depressing . for me , The Grapes of Wrath is a
472805	11423174	363468	10.0	terrific animated film that the whole family should enjoy	this is the only version of Ben Hur that i have seen so far , so i can't compare it to other versions . i will say i really enjoyed this animated version . it's a combination of traditional and 3d animation . visually it is very stunning . the details are very rich vivid . the movie clocks in at less than 90 minutes , but there is a lot jammed into that time . Charlton Heston , who played Ben Hur in the 1950's version is back as the voice of Ben Hur . as i watched the end credits , i noticed that many voice actors portrayed several different characters . i found this amazing , as the characters each had their own distinct sound . i would not have known this if i hadn't watched the end credits . to me , this is a testament to the skill of the performers . this movie is very family friendly , with just one or two scenes that may be a bit intense for young children , so parents may want to preview the movie first before their little ones watch it . this is a great movie overall in my opinion , and well worth watching . my rating is for the animated version of " Ben Hur " .
472526	11423174	316654	10.0	wow ! ! ! is all i can say	unbelievable . the first spider man movie was awesome , but this movie was even better . better special effects , better story , better villain . i didn't think there was any way the first one could be topped . in this one we have doc ock as the main villain , an inspired choice . the fight scenes this time around are absolutely mind blowing . added to the mix is that peter parker " s friend harry Osborne has become spidey's mortal enemy since discovering spidey had a hand in his father's ( green goblin ) death . there is an interesting and surprising subplot , which i won't reveal here . i gave the the first movie , so i have to give this one a 10 + / 10 and i can't wait for the third installment .
473314	11423174	89886	10.0	awesome	this film is awesome . i loved it . it's only Val Kilmer's second feature film , the first being Top Secret a year earlier . basically , it all about a college full of misfit geniuses and the mischief they get into , since most of them don't have to study . there are some very quirky characters , and some pretty funny pranks . but it's not all fun and games . possible spoilerthe students actually end up foiling a top secret military plot as well . end of spoilerfor sheer zaniness , it's hard to beat this film . the music , especially by Tears for Fears took me back . if you're looking for high art , this movie is far from it . but , if you just wanna sit back , turn your bairn off , and have some fun , this could be you movie . for me , it's a perfect
472771	11423174	462538	10.0	a laugh riot	i loved this movie . i was skeptical about it , thinking it would just be an overextended episode of the TV show . after all , many half hour shows have tried to transition into a successful feature length film , and very few actually succeed but since my friend bought it , i thought why not . as it turns out , this was one funny movie . and it actually had enough of a story to make a feature film . it was at least as funny as the earlier Simpsons episodes are , and a bit more risqué . but the bottom line is that it is hysterically funny . i don't know what else to say , other than i'm just so happy the the movie actually succeeds , with a decent storyline . it probably helps if you've seen the TV show first , but i don't think it's necessary . The Simpsons movie gets a from me
473804	11423174	61301	10.0	classic animation	this animated Spider man series ran 3 seasons with 77 episodes . i remember watching it as a kid and loving it . i finally bought it on DVD and i love it just as much today . sure the sound effects are cheesy , as is the music . and you can tell they had a very limited budget to work with and there are a lot of goofs in the show , but so what . that's all part of its charm . the villains are great and a lot of action is packed into the roughly 12 minute episodes ( some are around 20 minutes ) the Theme song is brilliant , and actually not in a cheesy way , it's instantly infectious and memorable . after you hear it once , it'll probably stick in your head . not many shows form that era stand the test of time , but this one certainly does . for me Spider-Man the animated series ( 1967 ) is a well deserved
473458	11423174	405159	10.0	new shoes ? 30$ - - - - - - Million Dollar Baby ? priceless	every once in awhile , a movie comes along that defies description . Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is that movie . One of the best movies ever made by one of the greatest directors , this is a movie that will not leave you untouched . Paul Haggis ( Crash ) wrote the screenplay for this cinematic treasure and the stage was set . with Eastwood as Director , the next piece of puzzle was the cast . And what a cast . You have Hilary Swank in a moving , powerhouse performance in the lead role . you have Eastwood himself in strong supporting role . and you have the great Morgan freeman in an understated , but no less superb performance . these three make it seem so effortless . the rest of the supporting players are also strong . I don't want to give too much away , for those who haven't had the pleasure yet . the basics of the film are as follows . Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgeraldd a woman who has nothing-but a desire to be a boxer . Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn , a grizzled boxing trainer , hardened by life . Morgan freeman is Eddie Dupris aka " Scrap " , Frankie's lone friend and Manager of his boxing club . Maggie walks into Frankie's life one day , desperate for him to train her . Frankie refuses at first and Maggie never gives up . Frankie finally relents ( with a bit of help from " scrap " . and the stage is set . What follows is the growing relationship between Maggie , Frankie and " Scrap " and the lessons they learn nd teach each other . until the end , with a closing act you won'soon ( if ever ) forget .
473427	11423174	97607	10.0	excellent drama dealing with the traumatic after effects of the Vietnam War	after just having watched The Deer Hunter , which is a masterpiece , the movie Jacknife had big shoes to fill . it has same themes as The Deer Hunter , the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War . Robert De Niro is in this film , as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here , as is Kathy Baker . but this movie belongs to Ed Harris , who gives a powerful , emotional and impactful performance . the movie is based on a stage play , and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me . by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play . that was not that big a deal , and doesn't really diminish the film . i actually really liked this movie . it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter . they are about similar era and have similar themes , but they are two very different films . i thought The Deer Hunter was great , and i also think this movie was great . it's the acting in this one that makes it so great . for me , Jacknife is a
472679	11423174	112744	10.0	shattering !	this film was amazing . it's basically a story of loss , revenge , redemption and forgiveness . there are two main characters , for both of whom redemption and forgiveness seem impossible . both have suffered loss , but only one seeks revenge . the movie tells the story of how our main characters get to the point of redemption and forgiveness , and it's not how you'd think . at least it wasn't for me . Jack Nicholson puts in what i would call a career performance here , as does David Morse . Sean Penn wrote the script and directed the movie . he did a masterful job in both areas . it's emotionally very powerful , and i shed some tears in some scenes . the only downside i can think of for this film , is for me , there was a bit too much unnecessary nudity . i realise that there had to be some to give . us an idea of one of the main characters , but i think it went a bit overboard . still the rest of the movie is so well done , that i give it a
473681	11423174	103064	10.0	" I know now why you cry , but it's something i cannot do "	as good as the first terminator movie is , this one is better . it's got harrowing action sequences , quite a bit of humour , and more character development . it's not as dark as the first one . instead it has more of hopeful tone . it has strong message too , that is becoming more and more relevant each passing day Arnie is back , but this time his terminator is has more dimensions to his personality . Joe Morton , a terrific ( though underrated ) actor also plays a prominent role , and is also terrific . Linda Hamilton returns and her character is much more defined and has more to do . she is certainly up to the task . but really , the ( human ) star of the movie has to be Robert Patrick in what i think was a career making performance . the guy is just amazing . the biggest star of all in this movie would have to be the special effects . they were beyond cutting edge then , and they still stand the test of time today . for me this movie is definitely in my top 10 movies of all time . my vote for Terminator 2 : Judgment Day is a perfect .
473195	11423174	68137	10.0	great quality , family friendly viewing	this comment refers to the 1976 television series which lasted 26 episodes although on this site it is shows just 10 episodes . y sister & i watched this show when we were young kids . and really liked it . fast forward thirty years , and we still enjoy it . this is one show where the appeal doesn't wear off like many shows of the time . i mean , the acting is great , the scenery is very nice . the show may be dated , but it doesn't feel that way at all . i recently bought the complete series and i'm really glad i did . of all the actor sin the show , as far as i can tell , only Diana Leblanc , who played the mother Elizabeth , and Chris Wiggins , who played the father Johan ( he was actually referred to as simply John on the show ) actually acted much , before and after the show , although Ricky O'Neil who played Franz was in TV show episode and TV movie before then . anyway , as for " Swiss Family Robinson " i can't say enough for this show . it's family friendly , quality television . ( very young children may be a bit frightened by some scenes ) my vote for this show :
473268	11423174	237123	10.0	easily stars on the laughometer	this ' Brit Com ' gets an easy from me . the Brits really know how to make a great sitcom . the writing easily rivals that of any North American show of this genre or any genre . the show is more risqué than many shows we have here , though things have changed in the that regard in the last few years . this is due mainly to the proliferation of specially channels . anyway , back to " Coupling " . the writing is superb as are the performances . i would probably say that this show is equal to " Friends " in quality writing and performances , but that is just my opinion . if you have fairly conservative tastes , this show is not for you , as it could be considered offensive or worse . everybody has their own opinions . for me , nothing beats " Coupling " for pure hysterics and misunderstandings . as i said , an easy for me
472665	11423174	260320	10.0	finally , a comedy worth watching ( for all the right reasons )	wow . this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . I don't think i have ever laughed more or harder . i mean this in a good way . finally , a comedy that is not just funny , but hysterical . without giving away too much , the plot is this . Max accidentally clones a women named Kate , and he and his buddy Henry decide to to teach the clone to behave like a guy , thinking she would be the perfect woman . disaster and hilarity ensue . the beautiful and very talented Ali Landry plays the dual role of Kate and the clone Repli-Kate . Ali does an astounding job as the woman who behaves more like a man than most men . this movie is brilliant . a warning though , this movie is definitely not for young kids , due to very crude language and sexual situations . out of 10
473702	11423174	279600	10.0	a worthy addition to the Superman mythos	it just keeps getting better and better . while i will admit the 1st season was a bit slow , the second improved slightly . however from then on , it just exploded . each episode , never mind each season is more riveting than the last . having just finished season 5 , which blew me away with the last episode , i can only imagine what season 6 must be like , Especially as Clark inches ever so close to his ultimate destiny , Superman . Smallville is a very unique and compelling look at Clark Kent , before he becomes Superman . the only question is , how long can they keep it going , as Clark must soon be ready to make the leap . will they continue on , with Clark as Superman ? either way , let's hope they have the presence of mind to end things on a high note . for right now , however , the series shows no signs of slowing down , or diminished quality . Alfred Gough and Miles Millar have crafted truly unique vision of Clark Kent's pre Superman era , which will take it's place among pop culture as a worthy addition to the Superman lore . I have to give Smallville
473115	11423174	112722	10.0	tension , and suspense through the roof	as suspense / thrillers go this one is top notch . it is extremely suspenseful and thrilling . but it's also very graphic and disturbing . i had a hard time watching because of that . but good movies of this genre do that , make you uncomfortable and unnerved . besides , i didn't find it gratuitous at all . plus , there's a great twist in this one . a lot of people will probable figure it out , but i still think it's a great twist . the acting is first rate here , from all concerned . Holly Hunter and Wil Patton are very good , and Dermot Mulroney puts in a great performance . but in my mind it is Sigourney Weaver and Harry Connick who own the movie with their performances . this movie has elements of Silence of the Lambs and Seven , but it is no copycat of those movies . it is it's own movie , and in my opinion , better than Silence , and as good as Seven , maybe even a bit better . i haven't seen a movie with this much intensity in along time . it's one of those movies that will likely stick with you long after the end credits have rolled . at least it has with me . for me , Copycat is a perfect
473901	11423174	337978	10.0	a real rush , but those of you who need a little bit of reality and / or logic to their action won't like it	this , the 4th installment of the Die hard franchise is easily the most thrilling and action packed . however , logic and reality are thrown out the window for the action scenes . if you like your action with a little bit of realty and logic , you won't like this movie . but for me , the movie was so fun , i didn't care . but beyond being just a slam bang action thrill ride it's also very relevant and thought provoking . if the technology that society almost totally depend on were to completely crash , how would you react , and hoe would the general public react . this movie gives one hypothetical example of the answer to that question . it's great to see this installment is geared more towards our techno savvy contemporary audience . but it's also still great for audiences that grew up with the franchise . not only is this a thrilling and thought provoking movie , but it's also very funny , possibly the funniest of all four movies . for me , Live Free or Die Hard is a perfect for sheer excitement alone . the rest is just gravy .
472767	11423174	307987	10.0	Badder Santa , the unrated version	i really enjoyed this Christmas movie that's actually the ultimate anti Christmas movie i have seen . by that , i don't mean it's against Christmas . i mean it's totally the opposite of what you would normally think of as A Christmas movie . it's rude , crude , offensive , totally inappropriate and absolutely a riot . this is definitely not your father's Christmas movie , that's for sure . it's loaded with vulgar and / or offensive dialogue , and shows Santa in a much darker light . i guess you'd call him the anti Santa . it's bold , and brash , and pushes all kinds of envelopes without apology . it has the beautiful and talented Lauren Graham , from The TV series , The Gilmore girls . this character is a total departure from that character , pretty much the exact opposite in fact . yet Graham is so skilled that i never once thought about Gilmore Girls . and she is very funny . Billy Bob Thornton plays the title character and is hysterical . the supporting cast is also great , including Tony Cox , Bernie Mac , John Ritter . i should also mention the writing and the dialogue , which are brilliant . the dialogue is witty an fresh . but be warned , if you are someone who gets easily offended , avoid this movie . if not , sit back and laugh you're a @ s off . a very enthusiastic
472721	11423174	120789	10.0	a triumph	i really enjoyed this movie . i thought it was very clever . it also deals with themes that are as relevant today as they were in the 1950'snad it touches on themes that were relevant in the 1940'sthis film is set both in the 90's and the 50's . it's multi-layered in terms of story and content . there's a lot of depth here . a lot of thought was put into the characters , as well as the story . it's very thought provoking , as well as entertaining and even funny . not only is the story well written , but so are the quirky characters . Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Magiure are wonderful as the two leads . Jeff Daniels , Joan Allen , William H . Macy , J . T . Walsh , and the great Don Knotts also star and are equally good . Credit must also go to Gary Ross , who not only directed the movie , but also produced and wrote it . even though there are some dark themes , i think this a movie that could be , and should be watched by the whole family . but parents should use their discretion . for me , Pleasantville is a
473699	11423174	108778	10.0	possibly the funniest and best written sitcom in modern times	Friends is quite possibly the funniest and best written sit com of the modern era . this show is fantastic . great characters , great dialogue , hysterical comedy . i actually wasn't into Friends for the longest time . then , i saw an episode on TV and was hooked . i have since bought all ten seasons on DVD . besides just being funny , the show has an edge to it . sometimes it is even racy , but subtly so , because on occasion the characters would say or do something that made me think , hmmm , the censors must have missed that one . the show revolves around the lives of six twenty somethings living in New York City Their favorite hang out is a coffee shop called Central Perk ( a great play on words ) each of the friends has their own different personalities and quirks , which all mesh together perfectly . the show rarely delved into any serious drama , but it didn't need to . It's strength is clearly comedy . creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane hit gold with this series . Kauffman also wrote a majority of the episodes and Crane wrote a number as well . the show remained consistently high quality throughout its 10 year run , and the last season was more serious than the previous . if you want a show which will have you p - - - ing your pants and bawling with laughter , this is your show .
473033	11423174	56592	10.0	classic with Gregory Peck	this is an outstanding film . it deals with the subject of hate and ignorance , and basically tells us we should all treat each other with respect and caring . the dialogue is very well written and the characters are all interesting . Gregory Peck gives a brilliant understated performance as a humble small town lawyer who tries to teach his children the same morals and values he has . he ends up taking a very unpopular court case , and his resolve is tested . the movie has a voice over narration by the adult version of one of the children , and i found it very effective . not everyone will like , this movie . it movies a a sedate pace , and some will find that boring . but if you do watch it to the end , you will probably be moved by it . i know i was . my vote for To Kill A Mockingbird is a
472619	11423174	347971	10.0	very well done documentary	this is an extremely interesting documentary on jack the ripper and who he really was . the difference is this documentary also has a panel of experts who weigh in on the subject , and give their opinions of who the killer was . when this documentary was made over 20 tears ago , there were were a only a handful of suspects . since that time , there may have been more information and other / more suspects . or the identity of the ripper may have been definitively proved . i don't necessarily think the show was successful in unmasking the killer , but it certainly could have been one of the suspects which they focused on . nonetheless , it is highly informative and entertaining , and well researched . Peter Ustinov as host was a good choice . i enjoyed his dry wit and dark sense of humour . for me , The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper is a
473505	11423174	365513	10.0	a brilliant comedy classic ( hopefully intentional )	this has got to be one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . i think or at least hope ) it was intentional . think of every horror movie you can think of and mix them all together ( minus the horror aspect of course ) . add in every conceivable cliché you can imagine along with the most inane dialogue ever written . then populate your film with every possible backwoods , redneck stereo type you can find . next add in your stock victim characters doing all the stupid things the horror genre is known for . and of course the two most important ingredients : absolutely atrocious acting and no discernible plot . put all this together and you have what has to be on of the funniest comedies ever made . actually it's billed as a horror comedy , but one out of two ain't bad . i nearly wet myself throughout the whole movie . this is an absolute gem . if the filmmakers intentionally set out to make their film this funny , they are truly brilliant . if not , there is no hope for any of them . I will mention that the last act was definitely played for laughs . it is the rest of it that is hard to pin down . if you're feeling depressed or even a little down , watch this cinematic masterpiece , and you'll be holding you guts from laughter . forget Prozac , use this movie instead . if you have to dig down to the bowels of the earth to find this movie , do it .
472973	11423174	120689	10.0	a mystical , supernatural journey seen through he eyes of one man	we have here another rare case of a Stephen King novel which translates well to the big screen . i really enjoyed this story . it's has elements of both the supernatural and the mystical . or maybe those two elements are both the same . either way , this is a well written movie , with well written characters . it's very dramatic and quite long , but that's no criticism of this movie at all . quite the contrary . the movie flows very well and is almost over before you know it . you will want to watch this one more than once . the green mile refers to the long walk from the jail cell to the execution chamber in one particular prison . the movie takes us on a journey of many years as seen and told by one prison warden in particular named Paul Edgecomb and played by Tom Hanks . Edgecomb's life will eventually be transformed by an encounter with one very special man , who end up a prisoner . this is where the supernatural and mystical aspects come in . i'll leave it at that . fro me , " The Green Mile " is a
473503	11423174	120609	10.0	absolutely brilliant action / comedy / dysfunctional hit men movie	this movie blew me away . it is absolutely brilliant . it seamlessly combines action , comedy , awesome dialogue , with shamelessly over the top fighting and stunt work . There are are even some tender romantic drama scenes . there is a large amount of swearing but it fits with the movie , so is not gratuitous . i won't give any of the plot away , because it has too be seen to be believed . this is an ensemble piece , with great performances across the board . the film is paced perfectly and never loses steam for a minute . some of the situations and actions are so ridiculous ( and intentionally so ) absurd , you just can't help but howl with laughter this movie is an absolute riot from start to finish . i can't recommend it enough . if you haven't seen " The Big Hit " you owe it to yourself to do so . i don't ' understand how anyone can dislike this movie . 10 + / 10
473700	11423174	238784	10.0	in a very close race for best show on TV	Earlier on , in a review of CSI : Las Vegas , i wrote that CSI may be possibly be the best show on the air . the only other show which might ( i mean might ) be better is the Gilmor Girls . Now it isn't really fair to compare the 2 shows , since they are not the same genre . CSI is a forensic crime drama , which does employ dark humour at times . Gilmor Girls is a drama / comedy , but it uses wit and sarcasm as humour quite often . so really the are not similar at all . if you are not familiar with the show it goes like this : Lorelai Gilmor ( Lauren Graham ) and her teenage daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) cope with life in the small town of Stars Hollow . i say cope because they live in a town with some very eccentric , some say odd characters . and there are a few that may just be nuts . in addition to having to deal with the townsfolk , both also have to contend with Lorelai's overbearing mother and distant Father , who live outside of town , but for reasons i won't reveal here , they must spend more time than they want to with them . Or rather , Loralie must spend more time than she wants to . there is more to the story than this , but i don't want to give it away , for someone who has not seen the show . The show was created by Amy Sherman , who with her husband Daniel also wrote several of the episodes up to and including season six . this show is amazingly well written , the dialogue is truly magnificent . one of the signature devices in the show is the rapid fire , back and forth banter between Lorelai and Rory , and the way the communicate with other people . the show , aside from being witty and sarcastic , is also very edgy . it deals with some vary serious adult issues at times , and is sometimes heartbreaking . The other thing Gilmor Girls is known for is it's pop culture references . each episode is peppered with them , some of them obscure . if you're not paying attention , you will miss a lot of them , as they are usually referenced machine gun style , almost as an aside . anyway , the show started off brilliantly and has remained so . this isn't just a chick show , despite what you may think . Guys will love it too , though some may not readily admit it . if you haven't seen it , you should start by picking up season 1 , since the storyline has progressed from each episode . what else can i say except , awesome , awesome , awesome .
472863	11423174	358273	10.0	a stunning biography of johnny cash	wow ! ! ! i'd heard this was a great film , so i finally decided to watch it . i have to say , it exceeded my expectations . the acting was amazing in this movie , as was the direction . i really liked the fact that it showed cash at his worst , as well as his best . there was a great back story to walk the line , beginning with cash as a twelve year old child , and how he had a less than perfect childhood . his father was a jerk , to put it mildly , while his mother just stood on the sidelines , allowing young john to be treated poorly . the supporting performances were also very good . but it was joaquin phoenix ( as a grown up cash , and reese witherspoon , as june carter who would eventually agree to marry him and become june carter cash ) , who were both brilliant . there was great chemistry between the two , and you really wanted them to get together . i really liked the interplay between the two . the dialogue was well written . i also loved the old songs , from the 50s and 60's . this film showed cash as a rockabilly type singer , before he became famous for his country songs . he was very popular as a rockabilly singer , much more popular than i think most people realize . he wasn't a perfect person , by any means . he had his problems , but was deep down a good man , and really tried hard to turn his life around . you felt sympathy for him and felt his happiness when june carter finally agreed to marry him . this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . great movie all around . wow ! ! ! i highly recommend it . even if you are not a johnny cash fan , ( which i wasn't ) , you will be entertained . as an aside apparently both phoenix and witherspoon did all the singing themselves , making their performances even more amazing .
472659	11423174	104692	10.0	mind blowing sci-fi fantasy movie	the original Lawnmower Man is a masterpiece . great acting from both Pierce Brosnan and especially from Jeff Fahey , who plays the title character , but whose real name is Jobe Smith . Jobe is nicknamed the Lawnmower Man because that's what he does-mows people's lawns . However Jobe is Mentally challenged with the intellect of a young child . he is of course picked on by many , and abused both physically and mentally by the person entrusted with his care . It just so happens , however that Jobe lives next door to and cuts the Lawn of Dr . Lawrence Angelo , ( Pierce Brosnan ) a scientist whose field is the study of intellectual enhancement . to make a long story short Jobe willingly becomes a participant in Dr . Angelo's research and gains enormous intelligence , more than could possibly be imagined . this intelligence comes with a grave cost however . the above premise is brilliant and superbly executed . What could have been a disaster turns into near perfection , due not only to great acting , but also the skillful direction of Brett Leonard , who later helmed the very well done " Virtuosity " , starring Russel Crowe . He also helmed the upcoming " Highlander : the Source " and unfortunately , the pathetic " Man thing " so you never can tell . anyway , back to the Lawnmower Man . aside from the great premise , good direction and acting , this movie also had one other thing going for it : mind blowing special effects achieved with cgi , i believe which is all the more astonishing since this art form was in its infancy . bottom line-awesome movie .
472819	11423174	104691	10.0	brilliant epic adventure	this film ranks as one of Michael Mann's best films , and he has directed some good ones , and a few not so good . it takes place in 18th century ( 1757 to be exact ) North America , during the French and Indian war . Daniel Day Lewis stars as Hawkeye an adopted member of the dying Mohawk Indian tribe . Hawkeye just happens to be a white man , who along with the other two remaining Mowhawks , are on the run , as they refuse to join the English and struggle to stay alive and regain their freedom . along the way they engage various enemies and come to the aid of others . there is also a romantic element to the story which works well . the dramatic and action moments both work very well and the fighting scenes are very well done . i really like the fighting styles the Mohicans employ . when all is said and done . this is a first rate movie with first rate performances . a very strong
472972	11423174	111161	10.0	moving and emotionally impactful ( if you liked " The Green Mile " you will like this movie )	like " The Shawshank Redemption , " The Green Mile " is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen . as in " Mile " , this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont , who also wrote the screenplay . another similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man ( Morgan Freeman ) who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go by . he tells the story of one man who becomes a prisoner ( TIm Robbins ) and who he becomes friends with . the movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system . unlike " The Green Mile " , there is no mystical or supernatural element to this film . however , this film is of the same calibre of " Mile " , owing to its solid writing , acting , and direction . " Shawshank " is very dramatic , yet very compelling . it's also a very moving tale . it will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually . and before i forget , i must also mention the ending , which i thought was very strong . for me , " The Shawshank Redemption " is a strong
473319	11423174	399295	10.0	Interpol agent pursues arms dealer	Lord of war is a very effective movie . it is well written , there is a decent back story to the main character via numerous flash backs . Nicolas Cage plays an arms dealer being pursued relentlessly by an interpol agent . ( Ethan Hawke ) I liked the first person narrative with Cage doing the voice-over . it worked well with this picture . a friend of mine complained that it was too preachy , telling us of the evil of guns and showing the deaths of many people particularly young people , to hammer home the point . However i chose to see it as a piece of entertainment , looking beyond what the agenda might have been . if we always look for a hidden agenda in a movie , then we rob ourselves of the experience and we limit ourselves to certain movies and lose out on other perhaps great films . Of course independent of all this we hope the movie is well made and has some entertainment value . Lord of War is one of those movies . it is immensely entertaining , with good performances . i love this movie .
473282	11423174	80749	10.0	a true classic in the horror genre	where do i begin ? john carpenter's " the fog " is truly a great movie . the filmmakers had a limited budget , but achieved a lot on what they had . the plot is as follows : a thick fog rolls into the town of " antonio bay " on the day of the towns 100 year anniversary . but this is no ordinary fog . it hides within it the ghosts of some sailors ( from a leper colony ) who were betrayed and left to die by the founders of the town . these ghosts seek revenge on the ancestors of the founders , and of course innocent people also die by their hands . " the fog " has many things going for it , including a great musical score ( done by carpenter ) which helps to ratchet up the tension . it also has good acting and plenty of suspense throughout . visually the movie is very beautiful , with nice shots of the landscape and the surrounding area . there are no special effects to speak of ( other than the fog itself , which glows eerily ) but this movie doesn't require any . nor will you find an abundance of gore , as is sadly the case with most so called horror movies made today . it relies on good old fashioned chills and thrills and succeeds admirably . but the best thing " the fog " has going for it is adrienne barbeau . who plays stevie wayne , dj and owner of her own radio station on the bay . that husky , smooth sultry voice gets me every time and is absolutely perfect for this movie . of course we do get to see her too , ( alas with clothes on ) which is also awesome . all in all a great movie , which unfortunately was remade into a not so great movie . skip the remake . stick with the original .
472892	11423174	80661	10.0	unrated version	i just finished watching Dressed to Kill , which is written and directed by Brian De Palma . the DVD had both the " R " rated version and the unrated version . i chose the unrated version . since i have yet to view the " R " rated version , i can't be completely sure of the difference . there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version . i guess you could call this scene soft core porn . if this sort of thing may offend you , i would suggest you view the " R " rated version . but i digress . Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version . this is a murder mystery / psychological horror / suspense movie . there is very little violence and blood . there is however one death sequence of note . the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic . however the blood it self does not look real . it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look . i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself , to give the scene a low budget feel . most of the violence , or rather possibility of such , is implied . the film is very well paced . as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose , which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films . anyway , i also thought the acting was good , especially Angie Dickinson . and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role , which works brilliantly in this case . the movie also has one great twist in it , in my mind , although some people might find it predictable . the only complaint ( and it's really more of an observation ) i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more , especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time . but i think she does a good job with what she is given . and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film . the film also has a strong moral to it , which is even more relevant today . but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it . i also really liked the musical score , composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho . to me , this music really elevated the movie . i thought this movie was brilliant . for me , Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) is
473147	11423174	477348	10.0	well told story	i've seen a few of the Coen Brothers movies , and didn't really like most of them . i just thought they were too weird . but this one's different . it seems more based in reality . these characters could exist and their actions are plausible . i also thought the characters were well defined within the confines of the movie . this is a dark movie , for sure . the story is set in 1980 , and is more or less told from the point of view of the local sheriff and his perspective on the changing times and the new breed of criminal . this is a crime drama , but it's also a western of sorts . it's violent , but not as much as many other movies . this is a character and dialogue driven movie . i thought it was well done . it's not an action packed movie . in fact , it may seem a bit slow at times but the story is told well enough , and the characters are interesting and engaging enough that it never becomes boring . in fact , i found it very compelling . i liked everything about this movie . No country for Old Men is a
473865	11423174	435625	10.0	pure adrenaline rush ( and frickin scary too )	my buddy and i recently watched neil marshal's " the descent " and i have to say we were impressed . unlike many horror movies , this one actually had good character development , crucial if you want the audience to have a vested interest in the characters and their fate . and the scenes in the cave are quite well done , showing the fear and panic of the characters . you really feel for them since you've had a chance to get to know them . once the action gets going , it grabs you by the throat and won't let go . we barely had time catch our breath before another intense action / horror sequence would bombard us . the tension at times was palpable , and once the creatures are revealed , they are truly terrifying indeed and you never know when or where they will show up . my friend and i both jumped several times throughout and it wasn't until the movie ended that we were able to take some deep breaths and sigh in relief , as our minds and bodies had been in overdrive . i thought the ending was good and unpredictable , which is rare these days . even after the movie ended it took awhile for us both to wind down from the adrenaline rush . this is a movie you might not be able to get through alone , so you are better of watching it with someone . be prepared for an adrenaline fueled thrill ride along with some genuine terror . you have been warned
473444	11423174	80684	10.0	The strongest Entry in the Star Wars Saga	how do you top a movie like the original star wars . well , it's not easy , but you make a better movie . by better , i mean a more fleshed out storyline and characters . also the motivations of some characters are more clearly defined . this movie is definitely darker than the original , which makes sense since the enemy triumphs , if only for a short time . this movie built upon the strengths of the 1st one , namely good story line which carries the movie forward and of course the villain , who is much stronger in this installment . it goes without saying that the visual effects are once again outstanding . this entry is considered by many to be the strongest of the saga , and rightly so . it sets up perfectly for its sequel " return of the Jedi " . this film gets a very strong only because that is the highest rating given by IMDb
473451	11423174	29843	10.0	brilliant	where to start ? this is one terrific movie . it's funny , has good characters and dialogue . it's also action packed . true , many of the fighting scenes seems a bit corny , but that's probably how they fought back then . back then , they really had to act , unlike today , where some special effect can distract the viewer , so the actor isn't the main focus . also , this was 1938 , and talking pictures hadn't brr around that long . many actors were used to the style of acting in the silent films and just carried that over to the talkies . as for the DVD itself , it has been beautifully restored . the picture is cleans sharp and crisp . anyway , for me " The Adventures of Robin hood is a
472614	11423174	138956	10.0	" fact or fiction ? you decide "	i stumbled across this collection by accident , and i'm really glad i did . it's an anthology series , containing five separate short stories in one hour . each tale has too do with the unexplained . the tales themselves defy explanation , logic , and even reality . the twist is that of the five stories , some are based on actual events and some are merely made up to entertain the viewer . it is not until the last segment is over that the host ( James Brolin in season one ) reveals which stories are true and which are made up . i like the idea of trying to separate fact from fiction . for me , this is a very compelling , well written series . each of the stories is less than 10 minutes long , yet gives you all the information you need . if you want something that'll send shivers down your spine , this is the series you've been waiting for .
472786	11423174	880557	10.0	don't over analyze it , just enjoy it for what it is	i don't get all the negativity about this show . i thought it was fantastic . i liked the stunts and the action sequences , the acting is good , and i thought the writing was good . casting Michelle Ryan in the title role was genius , in my opinion . she's beautiful , athletic , and talented . having Katee Sackoff guest star for five episodes was also a great idea . Lucy Hale is a perfect fit as Becca , Jamie Sommers's younger sister . her and Michelle Ryan have such a natural chemistry together . really , the whole cast is great . for me , this version of The Bionic Woman stands on its own merit . it doesn't copy the original . i had a blast watching the 8 ( and apparently only ) episodes . i don't think it deserved to be cancelled . anyway , for me , The Bionic Woman is a
473524	11423174	78346	10.0	technically and artistically brilliant	considering this movie was made in the late 1970's , it is a remarkable achievement . technically , it is nearly flawless , in my opinion . i guess there are few tiny details you could pick apart if you wanted to , but overall , it's a brilliant piece of work . as for the movie itself , i thought the story was superb , with a lot of depth to it . the movie was well acted and believable . Having Marlon Brandon and Gene Hackman was a stroke of luck , as well as genius . and hiring a then unknown Christopher Reeve in the title role was equally genius . having an unknown keeps the focus on the character and the story , not the actor . a famous actor in the role would not have been believable . Margot Kidder was also good as Lois Lane . the rest of the supporting cast was also great . this movie is a true epic , which still has an impact today . the special effects were cutting edge at the time . i think the movie as a whole has more than stood the test of time . an easy in my opinion .
473706	11423174	208874	10.0	truly great political intrigue film	The contender is a powerful , riveting movie of political backstabbing and hidden agendas . it is full of suspense and intrigue . a very dramatic film , yet not at all boring , with a great mix of characters and some explosive revelations . this is a very well done movie with some big name actors putting in stellar performances . Jeff Bridges plays president Jackson Evans , who , upon the death of the vice-president is faced with the task of nominating a replacement . Joan Allen plays democratic senator Laine Hanson , the president's nominee . However she must first appear before the confirmation committee and be approved . and this will not prove easy . this is where the movie really gets going . both Bridges and Allen put in solid performances , but it is Gary Oldman who plays committee chair Sheldon Runyon ( a republican ) who is a standout . Oldman gives a powerhouse performance . Christian Slater , Sam Elliott , William Peterson , Saul Rubinek , and Philip Baker Hall , among others also put in terrific performances . this is truly a great movie . but , if you are sensitive about your politics , you might want to avoid this one . otherwise prepare to be entertained for 2 hours .

473533	11423174	369339	10.0	hit man coerces cabbie to drive him to his hits	this is a Micheal Mann film , starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx . This has too be Cruise's greatest performance . He plays a hit-man named Vincent who forces a taxi driver named Max ( Jamie Foxx ) to drive him around all nite to his hits . Cruise is brilliant in this role . Vincent is a conservative , impeccably dressed man somewhere in his fifties . this is a much older character than Cruise usually plays . he is also really great as the villain . he exudes menace from every pore and has ice in his veins . Foxx is good as Max , but the movie belongs to Cruise . Mann makes this movie a real suspenseful nail biter . i think this is on of his better movies . Jada Pinket Smith and Mark Ruffallo are also in the movie with small parts , but both are pretty good in their respective roles , though i though Pinkett Smith was more impressive . i thought this movie was brilliant . i give " Collateral
473766	11423174	338751	10.0	Brilliant depiction of Howard Hughes's early years	" the Aviator is a brilliant piece of work . Martin Scorcese did a brilliant job directing it . but credit must also go to everyone else on the crew , for the astonishing look of the film . The film is a biopic about the early years of Howard Huges . it clocks in at close to 3 hours , but is so well paced , it is never boring . Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Hughes , and i have to say he blew me away with his performance , especially in scenes where he begins to deteriorate mentally , up to the point where he is a full blown paranoid schizophrenic . DiCaprio handles these scenes masterfully . The supporting cast is also very good , including Alec Baldwin , Cate Blanchett , Alan Alda , among others . i have no idea how factually accurate the movie is , but that is why it is called a biopic and not a documentary . I'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties to make the film more appealing and relevant to today's audiences . This is all in all , a brilliant effort from all involved . 10 + / 10
473211	11423174	62755	10.0	stellar performances from Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis	boy , this was a great movie . the acting by both Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis was really something . these are two phenomenal actors . Fonda was terrific as the head of a task force on the ' Strangler ' case . his performance was very sublime and understated but brilliant . Curtis as ALbert Desalvo gives a powerful , riveting performance . i also liked the film itself . it was kind of low key , but very atmospheric and effective . it was made in 1968 , only a few years after the stranglings . the filmmakers have their ideas about the events and their own take own things . some of it was no doubt fictionalized , and some of it likely came from what was known about the case at the time . regardless , in my opinion , this is a very good movie . it's entertaining and thought provoking . even if it was just entertaining , it would still be a good movie . but if a movie can be both , that's a bonus . on top of all that , it was way better than i had hoped or expected . it's not for everyone , i'm sure due to the subject matter , and some people may find it slow . but for me , i have to say " The Boston Strangler " is a

Janeane Garofalo plays Linda , Dune's ( ex ) wife . both Schwimmer and Garofalo are excellent here . Schwimmer sheds his Friendds persona with ease . i was not reminded of that show at all . this is a drama , but it also has some lite comedy bits . it's not depressing at all . in fact , i think it's hopeful and even uplifting . it's a small , independent gem that a lot of people did not see , unfortunately . if you get a chance , i highly recommend you watch it .
472918	11423174	140785	10.0	stellar performances in a stellar movie	this is a very moving and heartwarming made for TV drama . i'm sure many people cringe when they here the words ' made for TV . i think that's too bad , because there are a lot of well made TV dramas . this is certainly one of them . it is as i said heartwarming , but it also has its sad moments . it concerns a mentally challenged woman named Sarah ( hence the title ) played by Mary Steenburgen . she is in her 40's and has a normal daughter . Sarah can not look after herself , so she is looked after by both her mother Rose ( Marion Ross ) and also her daughter Mary Beth ( Kellie Martin ) rose dies and it becomes Mary Beth's responsibility to look after her . she has some help in the form of Lila , Sarah's aunt Lila ( Dianne Baker ) . anyway , the movie details the struggles they have in looking after Sarah . the movie does play on your emotions , but that doesn't matter because it has the goods to back it up back it up . there are few surprises in the movie and a revelation or 2 that you might or might not see coming . the acting is superb on all fronts , but it'Mary Steenburgen who turns in a superb performance as Sarah . she is very believable and credible in the role . Kellie Matin is also very strong as Mary beth . all in all , this is a very well made production . i can't find anything wrong with it . " about Sarah " is a definite
473287	11423174	142688	10.0	brilliant filmaking , depp in great form . a masterpiece	i loved this movie . i bought it on DVD with really no expectations . boy , was i pleasantly surprised . the performances were excellent , the music was perfect for the film . depp gives an understated performance which kept me riveted for the whole movie . frank langella is brilliantly cast as the bad guy . emmanuaelle seigner was particularly effective as the mysterious girl who always seems to show up where depp's character , dean corso happens to be to lend a helping hand . but of course all is not as it seems , as the ending reveals . the ending reveals just enough to tease the viewer . i can find no fault with this movie . many people complained about the ending , but i thought the ending was as it should be , leaving the viewer to wonder what might happen next , which was , i think the point . all of the deaths in the movie were very creepy and eerie , especially the death of the baroness with her and her wheel chair ending up in flames . i had not seen a polanski movie before , but he really impressed me with this effort . I have watched this movie several times and loved it each time . to those people who hated this movie , all i can say is " to each their own " and maybe it is an acquired taste . this movie is definitely in my top ten .
472828	11423174	31971	10.0	classic , brilliant western starring John Wayne and directed by John Ford	Stagecoach is a classic John Wayne western . the basic plot of the story is this : a motley group of 9 people end up on a Stagecoach together , which must somehow make it through Hostile Apach Indian territory . for a movie made in 1939 , this movie is very good . actually , it's very good even by today's standards . there are lots of thrilling action sequences , as well as some quiet dramatic moments . the acting is top notch , as is the direction . the movie is visually very striking , no small feat , considering it is in black and white . even the dramatic sequences are somehow compelling . Even if you don't like John Wayne , or westerns in general , you will like this film . i highly recommend it .
473517	11423174	397138	10.0	warning : may cause your stomach to explode from too much laughter	this is one of the frickin ' funniest TV shows i have ever seen . i actually had to quit watching because my stomach became too sore from laughing . this is a simple show , about a simple town , with simple people . this show is sprinkled with odd ( at first glance ) characters with various quirks and habits . i will definitely be adding this show to my DVD collection . i urge anyone reading this comment to check it out . i don't know how else to say it - - this show rocks . the writing is very clever and witty , and self deprecating at times . and while the characters may seem odd , they are very endearing . the budget for this show is not high , but it doesn't need a high budget . it gets laughs out of the simple things in life . i highly recommend it , but you will likely only be able to watch a few episodes , before your stomach can't take anymore . For me " Corner Gas is a
473536	11423174	84522	10.0	raunchy low brow cinema at its finest	i'm almost ashamed to admit it , but i loved this movie . it's sick and demented , offensive and political incorrect . but its a riot . it's set in Florida in 1954 . it's basically about a bunch of horn dog teenagers trying to lose their virginity . but there's a lot more going on than just that . there's a lot of double entondres ( not sure if that's the right spelling or not ) here and lots of sexual innuendo and and also sex without any innuendo needed . this is low brow cinema at it's finest . i can see why it's classic though . i laughed my ass off so much i thought i was gonna die . Bob Clark , who directed the original horror classic " Black Christmas " also directed this movie . there are a few serious moments dealing with racism and antisemitism , but mostly it's all about the laughs . if you wanna know what the title " Porky's refers to , you'll have to watch the movie . i have to give this movie for making me laugh my ass off so much .
473912	11423174	81283	10.0	i loved every minute of it ,	but it poses a dilemma that most films don't . you , see , the thing is , usually you can pick out certain actors and say so and so is the best , or the worst . in this movie , though , everybody is a standout . in this case , that's pleasant and all too rare dilemma . Donald Sutherland shines in his role , Mary Tyler Moore is exceptional in her performance , Timothy Hutton is outstanding in his first feature role . in the supporting category , i thought Judd Hirsch was terrific , although i wish he had a bigger role here . the film win four academy awards and richly deserved them all . i have to warn you , though , it's not one of those shallow surface , blink and you miss it type of movies . this one rich in depth , in story characters and dialogue . it is driven by those elements , so if you're not into heavy drama , steer clear of this one . it really had an impact on me . for me , Ordinary people is a
473356	11423174	104040	10.0	awesome ! , awesome ! , awesome ! romantic comedy ( the best )	this is one of my all time favourite movies . i went to see it when it opened in 1992 , and liked it so much i saw it several more times . ( I immediately had a crush on Moira Kelly and still do , to this day ) it's basically the story of pairs figure skater Kate Mosely ( Moira Kelly ) who is on the verge of Olympic gold at the 1988 Olympics , but disaster strikes , and Kate's dream of an Olympic gold medal seem shattered . because Kate is a prima donna , she can not find any partner to work with her , despite her immense talent . meanwhile , US amateur hockey superstar Doug Dorsey ( D . B Sweeney ) is receive permanent vision loss during a vicious hit in a playoff game during the Olympics off the same year . Doug's dream of pro hockey evaporates . I don't want to say too much more , but put it this way : 2 years later , these 2 wind up as training partners in a bid for Olympic Gold in1992 , and since they are both from completely different worlds , you can imagine what happens next . anyway , this movie has it a all , great dialogue ( especially the interplay and barbs shot back and forth between the Kate and Doug ) very well choreographed skating sequences , perfect music , amazing chemistry between the 2 leads . and , of course , romance , with some comedy . this movie is very well paced , with no spots which drag at all . as for the 2 leads , i don't think you could find a better match than Kelly and Sweeney . every time i watch this movie , it is better than the last . trust me , if you haven't sen " The Cutting Edge " , you owe it to yourself to do so . it's just a great film .
473837	11423174	253474	10.0	powerful wartime drama about one humble man and his music	this is an absolutely brilliant movie set during World War 2 . it stars Adrian Brody as Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman , whose only escape from the wartime hell is playing the piano . the screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood , based on the book by the real life Wladyslaw Szpilman , and is directed by Roman Polanski . the movie is touching and heartwarming , and also heartbreaking at times . it can be depressing , but is is also an inspiration . one man survives hell through music . but more than that that , others too are uplifted and have hope , all because of one humble pianist . Brody is brilliant , as always , inhabiting his character , as he always does . i don't think he's made a bad movie yet . or at least , he's always been great in every film , even if the film itself isn't . in this case , though , the film is brilliant . and say what you want about Polanski , he knows how to direct a movie ( we won't count " Rosemary's Baby " ) . if this film doesn't have an impact on you , i'd be surprised .

The man is a chameleon , inhabiting every role he plays . i have not seen him give a bad performance . the writing is inspired , with amazing dialogue , and well written situations and characters . the ending is explosive and leaves no loose ends . the film itself is very well paced , with superb editing and is also very stylish . it also has more depth than say , Cop Land , a similar though inferior effort . you can't go wrong with this movie .
473572	11423174	187393	10.0	astounding in every way ( be warned though , it is brutally violent and bloody )	i thought this movie was absolutely brilliant . it's set during the time of the American revolution . Benjamin Martin ( Mel Gibson ) is a simple farmer who does not want to get involved , as he doesn't believe in war . in short , he's a pacifist . that it , until one day a sadistic act of violence is perpetrated against his family . Martin transforms from the meek man he once was , to a man on a mission : to get revenge against the British in general , and the one Britsh officer in particular responsible . so , he becomes the leader of the Colonials . there's a lot of great names in here , and i won't mention them all . but i will mention Jason Isaacs , brilliant as a sadistic British Colonel and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel . i mention Cooper because you are guaranteed to see great acting from him . this movie is quite bloody and brutally violent . there are no punches pulled here . if you have a weak stomach shy away from this one . otherwise , for a war themed movie , i highly recommend it . one of the greatest movies i have ever seen . 10 + + + / 10

Burgess Meredith plays George , and Lon Chaney Jr . plays his travelling companion Lenny . Lenny is what you would call very slow and George has too look out for him and keep him out of trouble . he is a giant of man with the intellect of a child . the two men are forced to keep moving when George does get into trouble . they arrive at a ranch , and end up working . George has big dreams for the two of them . this movie is whimsical in tone at times , but also dark and tragic . Chaney is brilliant as Lenny . the dialogue is very good as is the direction . for me , Of Mice and Men is a
473568	11423174	141926	10.0	wow . outstanding ! ! ! nerve shredding tension ! ! !	OK , first things 1st . this movie is almost certainly not completely accurate historically , so if that's what you expect , you'll be disappointed . but if you can put that aside , you should love this movie . anyway , on with the show . this movie takes place during the 2nd World War . it focuses on a small group of Americans and a very important mission , one that would eventually turn the tide of the War . virtually all the action takes place at sea , and i gotta say , the tension in this thing nearly wrecked me . there were times i couldn't breathe and other times i thought i was = as gonna explode . if you like nail-biting down to the millisecond suspense , i can't see how you wouldn't love this one . there's not a lot of room for character development , but that's a good thing in this case . in fact , it may have ruined the movie . it's so well directed , i still can't believe . as a matter of fact as i'm writing this , my nerves are still shredded . this brilliant film was directed by Jonathon Mostow , who also wrote the story and the screenplay . He also directed and wrote both the story and screenplay for " Breakdown " another really good film , but nothing compared to this . anyway , i could go on forever , but for sheer tension and suspense , this is hands down , the best movie of its type i have seen , and i have sen some great ones . " U-571 " is off the charts for this rating system , so i'll give it 10 + + + / 10
473085	11423174	58182	10.0	simply brilliant	this is the first film starring the Beatles , and it's a good one . it's shot like a documentary , but it's not . i'm pretty sure there is some add libbing involved , but i think the film is mostly scripted . it's very funny , and has great dialogue . all four of the Beatles star here , and all are very good . their comedic timing is really good , and they all have some very witty one liners . Richard Lester directed . he is also the director ( officially ) a of Superman 2 and he directed Superman 3 but it's the acting and writing that take centre stage here . this is one of thee most enjoyable musical / comedies i have seen . in fact it's one of the most enjoyable movies i've seen in awhile . it's simply brilliant . and this is coming from someone who's not a big Beatles fan .
473421	11423174	73486	10.0	there's a reason why it's # 8 on the top 250	i'm glad i finally got around to this film . it's currently ranked # 8 in the top 250 here . i can see why . it's certainly an experience watching it . it's a very deep film , with a lot going on . it's very powerful , yet subtle . it's touching at times , sad at others times , and tragic at times . it's been referenced many times in movies TV shows , and more . it and it's legendary performances have become a part of pop culture . the acting is stellar . jack Nicholson won the academy award for his performance , and i'd say deservedly so . Louise Fletcher also won for her performance . she is mesmerizing . there are other great performances as well . i didn't recognize him for a while , but Danny Devito put in a great performance . there's also Christopher Lloyd in his first feature film . i also really liked the performance of Will Sampson . Brad Dourif in his his first credited film also really impressed me , as did Sydney Lassic . there are many other great performances here , too numerous to mention . the point is , i really like the film . beside the acting , it was also very well written , very clever . as it ended , i realized i was really moved by it all . some people might think this movie is overrated , and to each their own . but , if you haven't seen it yet , i recommend you watch with an open mind and draw your own conclusions . and don't let the running time of 133 minutes discourage you . it will ( unfortunately ) be over before you know it . for me , One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is
473539	11423174	185371	10.0	one of the better horror films i've seen	i'm truly amazed at the low rating ( 5 . / 10 ) this movie has here . i thought it was outstanding . it was well made , had dark humour , and great dialogue . plus there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you guessing . the tension is high throughout , there's plenty of gore for all you gore hounds . the babe factor is pretty high in this one . there is some nudity and some strong language , but i think it was appropriate for the movie . for me , it added some realism and authenticity . there are some good actors in this one , all putting in good performances . i thought the CGI was good enough . but honestly , i was more focused on the story , which i thought was really good . the whole movie has a haunting air pretty much from the get go , and i thought the opening credits were superb in setting the mood . plus i liked the ironic ending . overall , i thought this was a fun movie . i couldn't find anything wrong with it . for me , House on Haunted Hill is a
472657	11423174	75005	10.0	a terrifying masterpiece	the original The Omen , with gregory peck and lee remick , is a masterpiece of pure terror . possibly the most terrifying film ever made . gregory peck stars as robert thorne , a high level diplomat and lee remick stars as his wife katherine . when katherine miscarries their baby , robert swaps the dead child for another child from an orphanage without his wife's knowledge . not long after , sinister things begin to happen , like people dying horrible deaths under suspicious and bizarre circumstances . without giving too much away , thorne eventually discovers his child is the Antichrist . it is the events that lead up to this point which are truly terrifying . peck is brilliant as the atheist whose beliefs are challenged until he can no longer deny the truth . lee remick is great as thorne's wife who has her suspicions there is something terribly wrong with her son , but she simply dismisses these fears as paranoia . the musical score done by the late , great jerry goldsmith and aided by a choir chanting in Latin , in all the appropriate places is brlliant , adding a feeling of foreboding and doom throughout the movie , which sends chills up your spine . no other movie in recent memory can match The Omen for sheer terror . it should be noted that The Omen did not rely on gore or computer effects to achieve this level of terror but rather on pure psychological suspense and emotion . no movie in modern time can match The Omen for sheer terror . this movie is nothing short of brilliant .
473309	11423174	1043721	10.0	hysterical	i thought this show was hysterical . yes , it is offensive , crude and vulgar , but so what . the show does seem to make fun of white people ( which i happen to be ) but that's exactly what it is - - fun . people need to get over themselves and stop being so uptight . besides , a lot of the jokes pretty much reflect how many white people behave . if you can't take a joke , then turn off all your TVs and hide yourself in a cave . i don't think the jokes are cruel or mean , either . anyway , i laughed my butt of so much i had tears running down my eyes . David Alan Grier is the star of the show and plays most of the characters . i think he's very funny . i'm gonna try and catch this show every time it's on . it's the only show on The Comedy Network ( here in Canada ) which i have actually found worth watching .
473669	11423174	265632	10.0	something for everyone ( outstanding )	if you want a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy , this is the movie for you . it's a cartoon based on the Recess TV show . it has jokes and references both kids and adults will understand , and some that only kids will get , others only adults will get . but the main thing is , it's immensely entertaining . it's very funny at times , with some slapstick and some funny dialogue . it also has interesting characters . plus the story is good . it's easy enough for kids to follow , and not so simple that adults will be disinterested . it also ( without hitting anyone over the head ) shows the value of working together to solve a problem . it's definitely family friendly with nothing that should be considered offensive , but it does have a bit of rude humour . for me , just out of sheer entertainment value , i give Recess : School's Out a
473781	11423174	90605	10.0	more sci-fi / action than horror , but a better movie than the origninal	although Aliens is not the iconic film that alien is , it is still a better film . this film adds a new element by having multiple aliens rather than just the one . it improves upon the look of the creatures , and while maintaining high suspense , adds more action . this film is less character driven than the first . the characters are more developed though and there is more of a group dynamic going on . we have some of the characters fighting each other , as well as the alien threat . the pacing is a bit better in this film . Obviously , this film is not responsible for the rebirth of horror / sci fi , since the original lays claim to that . but it is , in its own right a classic and will be remembered for a long time to come .
473073	11423174	402249	10.0	absolutely brilliant independent Canadian horror / suspense film	wow . this film is fuing brilliant . as far as the horror / suspense genre goes , this may be the best i have ever seen . there is lots of suspense , some blood and guts and some truly terrifying moments . this is one intense movie . in fact , the tension is almost unbearable at times . if you're even a little bit squeamish , prepare yourself before watching this movie . aside from being a brilliant movie , it is also very unique and inventive . it does not follow the typical formula for these types of movies . also , the acting is superb . if you want a refreshing take on the horror / suspense genre , this is your movie . this movie is much more story and character based than others of the genre . it relies more on psychological terror than on gore . ( though it does have its share of gore ) it's an independent Canadian film , but it ranks as good as most of what the system churns out . for me , " The Dark Hours " is a perfect
472708	11423174	465551	10.0	notes on a masterpiece	this movie is definite 10 . i don't remember when i saw a movie as powerful and gut wrenching . Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench are 2 titans in the movie industry , and it shows in this movie . both actresses put on an acting clinic , with 2 Tour De Force performances . i won't give too much away , but lets just say as psychological dramas go , they don't come much better than this . the villain in this piece would have Hannibal Lector for dinner ( with some Fava beans and a good chianti , of course ) that is just my opinion of course . i know the character of Lector is held sacred by some . but watch this film and judge for yourself . for me , like i said , " Notes on a Scandal " is a
473381	11423174	404251	10.0	eye opening insightful look at the life of Muhammad Ali ( must see )	this is a fascinating , revealing and insightful look at Muhammad Ali and the impact he had in America . the movie is pretty comprehensive and in depth . it's also very heartbreaking . it chronicles his life as a young man just starting out as a boxer and up to his life in 2001 . ther's no doubt he was brash and very confident in the ring . but he was also very savvy and a great showman . he very easily psyched out his opponents , giving them a handicap before the fight even began . he was also a great self promoter and extremely charismatic . he often boasted " I am the Greatest " and as a showman he had no equal . he also was a great fighter with super hand speed and lighting quick reflexes and amazing foot work . these skills diminished over time of course , ( but his spirit never , and still hasn't , diminished ) allowing his opponents to hit him much more often and Ali should have hung up the gloves long before he did . unfortunately the accumulation of bows to his head over the course of this career cause the brain affliction of Parkinson's syndrome , a common condition in boxers . but this movie is about more than a boxer . it's a bout a man who stood up for what he believed in , never wavering , and refusing to give into the racism of the time and the government's attempts to make him go abroad to fight in the Vietnam war against people he had no quarrel with in war he believed to be unjust . Ali was and still is an inspiration to his generation and beyond . one thin's for sure , there never was , nor will there ever be another like him . despite his affliction , he remains positive about life and is is mentally strong . love him or hate him , you can't deny the impact he has had . finally , i was sickened by how ignorant many of the white people of the time were and how evil they could be in their treatment of their fellow man because of something as stupid as having different skin . those people are also useless pieces of sht and don't deserve to live with real human beings . hopefully , they will all burn in hell forever . anyway , for me , " Muhammad Ali : Through the Eyes of the World " is a must see . i give it
472546	11423174	364045	10.0	intelligent thriller	i thought his was a very intelligent , well written thriller . the music puts you on edge from the beginning . the movie has a great dark atmosphere . there are enough red herrings to keep you guessing , and some great intensity . this is a very dark , disturbing movie and is also very graphic at times . to me , this was much better than your standard crime drama / mystery / thriller . i liked Angelina Jolie's performance as an FBI profiler called in to help develop a profiler on a prolific serial killer who has been working for twenty years . he performance is very subdued , almost sublime , and it works , in my opinion . the best serial killer movie ever made , in my mind , is Copycat , at least so far . this one isn't quite as intense , but it's still a great movie . Like the Bone Collector , also starring Angelina Jolie ( and Denzel Washington ) i'd have to rate taking Lives a
473274	11423174	479143	10.0	a very fitting and great end to the series , which recaptures the " Rocky " spirit and magic	this is a great way to end the " Rocky " franchise , considering how weak number 5 was . there is some real depth to this entry , and Stallone put in a very heartfelt performance . he can really act , given the right material . Stallone wrote the script , and it is a good script . the movie is much more realistic than i thought it would be . given the premise ( an aging ex champ in his 50's fighting the current champ , a man 30 years his junior ) the movie would seem absurd , yet it Isn't . you'd have to watch it to understand . when first hearing they were making another installment , i scoffed , thinking it would be ridiculous and stupid . for some reason , though , i decided to watch it , and i am glad i did . this is easily the best installment since number 2 , which i believe was the best up to this point . I think " Rocky Balboa " is probably as good as 2 , and it really recaptures the magic of the earlier entries . this movie is very sentimental , in good way . Stallone makes it inspiring without being preachy . my vote for " Rocky Balboa " is
473880	11423174	71402	10.0	the ultimate vigilante film	Meet Paul Kersey , ( Charles Bronson ) mild mannered architect and liberal . Kersey Believes that the criminals are merely a product of being underprivileged and deserve some slack . spoiler aheadHowever , Kersey's views change one day , when his wife is brutally murdered and his daughter is raped by three thugs . his daughter has been so traumatized , she is nearly catatonic . Kersey then decides to fight back against the criminals . he becomes a one man wrecking crew , killing muggers rapists and others . as a result of his efforts , street crime dramatically decreases , and people begin to feel more safe . naturally the police dept can't have that , a vigilante going around blowing away the human waste , lower crime rate or not . never mind the fact that the police have been completely ineffective in curbing crime . in fact , their efforts have actually resulted in crime increasing . this movie illustrates the helplessness the average woman / man feels in the face of crime . it also shows the ineffectiveness of the legal system . the legal system seems to favour the criminal , and the bleeding heart liberal mouthpieces are always on hand spouting crap about how the criminals right are being violated , while no one seems to care about the victim . and it also shows how the police and the legal system are not concerned with citizen safety , but are worried about citizens taking matters into their own hands . see , the problem with the legal system is it bound by rules , regulations and basic bureaucratic bullsht . the system is useless unless your are a criminal . how can you fight criminals when they have no rules or regulations to bind them . and the other problem is the system is reactive , not proactive , so once you've been shot , stabbed , raped , or otherwise beaten or killed , then the police will help you . now think about that for a minute . when you actually need them , they are seldom there . ( i should qualify this by saying there are some decent caring people who care about the victims , but they are not as well funded as the other side ) in certain countries ( Canada , for instance , you are not even allowed to defend yourself in your own home . you will most likely be arrested and charged . on top of that , the scumbag who victimized you can actually sue you for their injuries . what the fK is up with that ? so , even if only in a movie , its nice to see the sht sack knuckle dragging wastes of skin get blown away . now , " Death Wish " was very controversial when it came out in 1974 , due to its graphic violence and language . i still actually find it hard to watch in some scenes . i wouldn't call it an entertaining film , but it was definitely an important film , the way it brought home the reality of crime and its effects . based on its importance as a film , i'd have to give it .
472947	11423174	109635	10.0	a riveting tale of sexual role reversal	disclosure is a refreshing film . it takes battle of the sexes and reverses it . here we have a film of role reversal , with the dominant , sexually aggressive woman against the weaker , more submissive male . it works beautifully in this film . i normally can't stand demi moore , but she is brilliantly cast here as the conniving seductress . equally well cast is Micheal douglas as the victim of her seductions . the basic plot is : a high level computer company specialist ( who is married ) finds out he will be working for a former lover . she initiates a sexual encounter between the two , rather forcefully . he resists and puts an end to the encounter . she becomes enraged , and vows revenge . she sues him for sexual harassment . he files a counter claim of sexual harassment against her . and there you have it . the stage is set for plenty of suspense and twists and turns , with a surprising revelation and a terrific plot twist ( which is down to the wire ) to end the film . I own this film and have watched it several times , and i'm riveted each time . out of 10 brilliant
473847	11423174	104346	10.0	terrific boxing movie about much more than boxing	i'm not sure why this movie has such a low rating ( ) , but it doesn't deserve it . by the way , this is not the Ridley Scott directed epic starring Russel Crowe . it's something entirely different . this movie is vastly entertaining . it's more than just a boxing movie . it's about heart and determination and beating the odds . and the power of friendship . usually theses kinds of movies are schmaltzy and sappy , with that rah , rah , rah attitude . you know , we can all succeed and everything is hunky dory . but somehow , this movie avoids that clichéd feel and succeeds . maybe because there's also some realism within it . there is a heartbreaking scene in the movie which brings some sobriety to the picture . the fight scenes are well done and quite brutal at times . the movie also has a good soundtrack , with some great songs , which really elevate the emotional aspect of the movie , but it's not overdone . overall , i liked it a lot . for me " Gladiator " is a terrific film . I give it a
472949	11423174	364146	10.0	great , and thrilling escapist fun ( exactly what it's meant to be )	i just don't understand it . this movie has a very low rating and many people are bashing it for not being scientifically accurate . but who really gives a crap if it's scientifically accurate . it's not a documentary , it's a fictional movie meant to thrill and entertain . and in theta regard it succeeds , in my opinion . the action scenes are spectacular and the special effects / CGI are very impressive , not just for a TV movie , but for movies in general . true , CGI is not completely real looking and may never be , but so what . it's escapist entertainment , not reality . i watch or go to a movie like this one to escape reality , not for a history , or science lesson . for me , this movie is entertaining and very thrilling . i was on the edge of my seat a lot . at times the action seems unrelenting and overwhelming , but in a good way . i love the feeling of my nerves and whole body on overdrive . it means the movie did what it is supposed to do . if you want a history or science lesson , go watch a documentary on those subjects . if you don't like these kinds of movies don't watch them . i saw this movie last night and my nerves were still on fire long after . as a result , i had to wait until today to write this review . i love this movie . it is the best disaster movie i have seen yet . 10 . 5 gets / 10 from me
473130	11423174	366551	10.0	brilliantly executed , hysterical road trip comedy	Harold and Kumar is about 2 stoner buddies who decide one night that they have to go to White Castle , a burger chain which they believe make the best burgers in the state . upon finding that the nearest White Castle is no longer in business , they set out a hysterical road trip across the state to find on e that is open . what follows is a series of hysterical misadventures and comedy of errors . this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made . it is easily in my top 3 comedies . brilliantly written , great acting from the 2 leads . the movie flows so smoothly , it's unreal . i was wiping tears from my eyes from laughing from beginning to end . my stomach was so sore it took me days to recover . but the experience was more than worth it . check it out out . you won't be disappointed . 10 +
472654	11423174	96438	10.0	not sure who the movie is marketed to	i didn't think this was a good movie . i can't pinpoint exactly why , but i can tell you i was bored out of my skull . it was much too slow moving , and i didn't find the gags funny at all . i'm guessing children would like this movie , but i think even most teenagers would be bored , but i could be wrong . truthfully i'm not even sure who the movie was marketed to . i mean , there are some funny cartoon moments that kids will probably find hysterical . and yet a lot a lot of the content is very adult oriented , especially a lot of sexual innuendo . however , i think it would be too slow for many adults . visually it's nice to look at , but that is not enough to maintain interest for very long . if you have kids who are preteen or younger , they will like this movie , yet it may not be suitable for them . i certainly wouldn't call this movie family friendly . i would have given it a PG-13 rating , at the very least , maybe even MA for mature audiences ( 14 + . ) anyway , parents should really use their discretion with this movie . overall , i think Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a .
473288	11423174	119654	10.0	one of the best sci / fi comedy movies ever made	this is a very clever and witty movie . it takes a serious subject , such as Alien Invasion and turns it on it's head . there will be a lot of laughter involved in the watching of this movie . at least there should be . the whole premise behind it is absurd , intentionally so . there's a lot of irony in this movie . Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith Play the two main Men in Black character . Jones plays agent K ( Kay ) and Smith plays Agent J ( Jay ) K is the straitlaced veteran who reluctantly trains a newcomer , Who takes the nickname or code name K ( Smith ) Jones and Smith work brilliantly together . Jones as the strait man and Smith as his comic foil . these two have some great comic chemistry . whoever had the idea to pair these two up deserves medal . i don't think they could have found two more perfectly suited actors on the planet . but amid all the hilarity , their is some serious stuff happening , and that is handled very well . even the serious scenes are played for laughs . this is in my top five in comedies . brilliant .
473874	11423174	105698	10.0	great action , clever writing , great one liners = one great movie	this movie really impressed me . it's clever , well written , and funny . it also has some great , memorable one liners . oh , there's also a ton of action . putting Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren in the same movie really works . add in the beautiful bombshell Ally walker and you have a really , really great film . this is so far my favourite Van Damme film . i really had a blast watching this thing . Van Damme even shows some acting ability . some of the expressions on his face and his deadpan delivery were very funny . Lundgren had quite a few funny one liners , and did OK in the acting dept . Ally Walker was also funny at times . some of the fight scenes are pretty good , too . normally , i don't expect a lot from a Van Damme flick , but i have to give the filmmaker's credit for this one . the crafted a great movie . i can find no fault with this movie . it's just so entertaining . maybe i'm crazy , but " Universal Soldiers " gets a from me .
473834	11423174	105695	10.0	Eastwood's's gritty opus of the old west	at the time i watched this movie , i hadn't been very interested in Western movies . but because this one was directed by Clint Eastwood and had a star studded cast , i decided to give it a try . boy , i'm glad i did . i really enjoyed the movie . Eastwood also stars in the movie , along with Morgan freeman , Gene Hackman , Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek , to name just a few . each of these A one actors are at the top of their game here . Eastwood crafts a gritty , dark version of the old west during a harsh and unforgiving time . the movie is brutally violent and unflinching in its portrayal of the time . some may find it depressing , and it does have that air to it , but i wasn't bothered by that aspect of it . i got caught up in the story and action . i also liked the dialogue . i thought it was well written . this movie definitely has epic written all over it . after watching this movie was responsible for my becoming interested in the Western genre . no small feat , believe me . " Unforgiven " is a
473677	11423174	430634	10.0	i totally enjoyed it	maybe i'm nuts but i fully enjoyed this movie . the biggest reason for me was just how fun it is . it's written with such wit and sarcasm , which is great . plus , it also shows the athleticism of the girls in gymnastics . it doesn't hurt that the film pokes less than gentle fun at both the judges in that sport and in another well known sport . sure you could say the movie is clichéd , but i thought it worked . it didn't pound you over the head with a sledgehammer to get a message across . i laughed virtually all through . and there's also some hot women , which is a also a good thing . but these women also have acting ability . true , were not talking about an academy award winning movie , but , being funny and able to zing off one liners , is in my mind , no less difficult than being serous . anyway , after all that rambling , i give Stick It a perfect 10 , because i forgot about life's problems and felt good while watching and after .

David Fincher directs this film , which concerns a serial killer who executes people , using the seven deadly sins as justification . though there are some horrific and graphic images here , there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror . this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled . David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller . Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer . Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt . William Somerset , on the verge of retirement , after this case . Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills . Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing . this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far . if you are not affected by this movie , i'd be surprised . for me , Se7en is easily a

" Star Odyssey " ( in English ) is a another cheap attempt to cash-in on the " Star Wars " success ; although it doesn't really steal much story , and attempts some of its own cheesy style . The title and advertising graphics must have lured fewer victims this time around , as there was no follow-up . Gianni Garko ( as Dirk ) and Yanti Somer ( as Irene ) manage to keep straight hero and heroine faces . This had to be difficult with lovesick robots " Tilt " and " Tilly " wandering around . The promise to alter their parts , so the mechanical couple would be able to consummate their relationship , is never shown on screen . Alas , it might have made the movie more than a complete waste of resources .

He is kidnapped , and appears in an Arabian setting , where he finds romantic Mary Ann Mobley . There are a number of women running about in harem outfits - so , you get the cleavage promised by the setting and situation ? but , little else . The most embarrassing musical number is Elvis singing " Hey , Little Girl " to a pre-teen slave girl . There really aren't any great songs in " Harum Scarum " ; which is quite a disappointment , because some of the bad Elvis movies have , at least , a few terrific songs . I did not hear the song " Animal Instinct " in the movie ; as I recall , that was a decent song . If they had to cut the " Animal Instinct " scene , they should have used the song over the credits ; on the " Harum Scarum " title song , Elvis sounds hoarse . A complete waste of Elvis .

Hoping to use the local legend of a sea monster as a cover for killing off the soldiers , the gangster and his crew discover that the legend is true , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Roger Corman's " Creature from the Haunted Sea " looks its best in the animated opening ; from there , it's all downstream . There is on-screen evidence that the people involved in this production were attempting some sort of satirical humor . Anthony Carbone ( as Renzo Capetto ) seems to be in charge ; he acts like Humphrey Bogart . Robert Towne ( as XK150 ) provides silly narration . For Pete's sake , a subplot has one of the crew finding love with a Cuban woman who can make animal noises with him . If this movie were being screened for Abraham Lincoln , he would call for John Wilkes Booth . Remarkably wretched .

Pursued by Soviet agents hoping to prevent his defection , Javorsky is forced to enter into a restricted atomic bomb test range in hopes of shaking off the agents , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Rotund actor Tor Johnson lumbers through this travesty , as " noted scientist Joseph Javorsky " ( accent on " noted scientist " ) . Director Coleman Francis also narrates ; his " The Beast of Yucca Flats " is a strong contender for worst film honors . There is no " camp " value . This film is sucks every ounce of enjoyment out of movie watching ; therefore , it should only be seen academically - - for example , if you are studying bad movies , it could win you a " my movie pick is worse than your movie pick " honors . If you decide to view " The Beast of Yucca Flats " , be sure you have alternate activities , or a friend , nearby .

Brewster uses some nefarious methods to extract his needed supply , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The author of the story supposedly makes an appearance at its closing - it's a good thing he rolls up the car window , to miss whatever you feel like throwing up at the screen . William Beaudine's " The Ape Man " is an embarrassment , even for a low-budget programmer . If the movie were a little better , you might be able to take some delight in Minerva Urecal's stone-faced sister , " Agatha Brewster " .

Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish , " The Fury of the Wolf Man " loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form . Lycanthropic Paul Naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual . Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate .

" Like other films of its type , " Perversion for Profit " sought to both frighten and titillate its audiences ; today , it's either offensive or funny ( depending on your mood ) . The film provides a generous parade of pornographic images . Narrator George Putnam ( subtitled " outstanding news reporter " ) promises the photographs displayed will cover up offensive body parts , " for the sake of decency " - but , don't worry , he mostly means the little dark slits covering some of the models ' eyes .

Later , city councilman Tol Avery ( as Millburn Willburn ) and his older blonde wife Marian Moses ( as Letty ) become additional hostages . The episode's bizarre storyline involves outlaw Lamas romancing the experienced " old blonde " ( Ms . Moses ) and the pliable " young blonde " ( Ms . Wells ) . The hostage victims are so taken by their abductor's charms , they begin to fight over him - desiring to continue serving him as hostage , in Mexico . Halfway into the story , Joe ( William Smith ) arrives , posing as a traveling salesman ( the " Stanley " character referred to in the episode title ) .

Mr . Kennedy is a fine performer ; but , his skills are not apparent in this episode . Chad ( Peter Brown ) , Joe ( William Smith ) , and Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) assume their regular roles ; star Neville Brand does not appear at all . The fact that Kennedy is ( perhaps with short notice ) acting essentially like the " Reese " character , in an inferior episode , is a sure sign something is wrong with the " Laredo " series . Moreover , it looks as if producers were trying out a slightly different situation , most notable in the addition of purely comic " weak " Ranger Henry Gibson ( as Freddy Gruber ) .

Of course , the North Korean communist guard is as dumb as they come . So , the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from a drawer , which is next to a bunch of empty boxes . I'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something ; but , of course , Reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty . Ya gotta laugh !

And , more evidence that everyone in show business is related can be found in Helen Stanton ( as Wanda ) being the real life mother of " Doctor Drew " aka Drew Pinsky .

It's a botched job . Eric Roberts ( as businessman Colin Wentworth ) meanders through the proceedings in a hopefully inebriated state . The obligatory " hot chick " moment is over quickly , blessedly ; if you're watching for that reason . The soundtrack rips off " Strangers in the Night " ( doesn't anyone own the copyright on that song ? ) . Quite possibly , this is the worst film ever made with Eric Roberts . One would certainly have to hope so , anyway . The credits end with a 1997 production date , so this may have been unreleased for a number of years . Really , they needn't have bothered .

In a related move , Fabian's fan club , the " Eager Beavers " express devotion on their derrières . Chill Wills is ( as Big Jaw ) and Harvey Lembeck ( as Charlie Bigg ) are among the unfortunate supporting cast .

Ladd's stuntman is very energetic , he might have been a better choice to play the lead role of " John " in this film . Peter Cushing has a very deep tan , which made me wonder if , perhaps , the actors thought they were being filmed in " Black and White " ? Oh well , I guess Mr . Cushing would have recognized that color cameras are different . Still , the movie has a very inexpensive look . I was so distracted by the costumes , I lost track of the plot .

" A man in town for a convention gets lost while trying to return to his hotel room , after seeing a woman , and ends up being taken in by a mortician to wait out a storm . To pass the time , the mortician shows the man four recently deceased people and begins to tell him how each person ended up as an occupant of one of his coffins , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . John Ericson ( as Talmudge ) is the man who finds refuge with mortician Ivor Francis , during the rainstorm . Mr . Francis ' four stories aren't as enthralling as his characterization is appealing . Bernard Fox ( as McDowal ) is featured in the , passable , third story . Mr . Fox was , perhaps , most memorable the delightful witch doctor first called upon by " Samantha Stevens " on " Bewitched " ; but , even " Dr . Bombay " can't save this plodding film . Charles Aidman ( as Toliver ) banters well with Fox . " Alien Zone " was appropriately re-titled " House of the Dead " . Steve March , vocalizing the theme song " The Sound of Goodbye " , sounds a little like his famous father .

That doesn't stop Dwayne Hickman as " Ricky " . Mickey Rooney as " Peachey Keane " arrives on the beach to search for " The Girl Next Door " , and he finds an eager ally in Harvey Lembeck's " Eric Von Zipper " , naturally . Is there such a thing as a " Cheap Beach Party " movie ? This one could not wait for Ms . Funicello to either get in shape or have the baby . Mr . Avalon is hardly present at all ; strangely enough , he is missed . The film is unimaginative in recycling ideas both good and bad . Astute observers will know the " twitch " in the ending cameo isn't even done correctly . On the plus side , Mr . Keaton has more to do this time around , and it's good to see he and Mr . Rooney in a film . The song material sounds better at the end , and the opening credits are the highlight . Still , the " Beach Party " film series looks more tired with every entry ?

Hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to Mazovia's actions , the group presses through the jungle to Angkor Wat in spite of the perils . The group includes Armand who has his own agenda contrary to the group's wishes , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Heads up ! the zombie make-up department revolted before the cameras started to roll . Also , this " Revolt of the Zombies " has little to do with its supposed predecessor " White Zombie " ( 1932 ) , which starred Bela Lugosi . If that film's zombies didn't thrill you , this one's certainly won't . A younger-than-usual Dean Jagger ( as Armand Louque ) stars as a man obsessive with blonde Dorothy Stone ( as Claire Duval ) . A couple supporting performances are good : devilish Roy D'Arcy ( as Mazovia ) and subservient Teru Shimada ( as Buna ) ; however , neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the dumps .

Pryor ( as Eddie ) had to have already been contracted and paid for this film to see completion . Otherwise , there are no credible responses to the remarks , " You guys are awful ! " and " This is NOT working ! " The most jaw-dropping unfunny moments involve yodeling . Mercedes Ruehl ( as Elaine aka Mimi ) has an sexy and effective black underwear scene . Pryor has a good sequence , upon arriving at the Fielding mansion . Wilder impersonates Cary Grant and Desi Arnaz . If you don't count Lucy , Ethel , and Elvia Allman working in the candy factory ( on the Fielding's TV ) , the early 1990s Hollywood location footage is the film's only real strength .

U . S . diplomat Robert Thorn ( Liev Schreiber ) substitutes an orphan for his own stillborn baby in order to spare his unknowing wife ( Julia Stiles ) . But after a series of grotesque murders and dire warnings , the Thorns come to the chilling realization that their child is the son of Satan ! " This is a well-produced , but uninspired re-make of the 1976 box-office revelation . After about thirty minutes , it's difficult to suppress the laughter ( the scene with the Thorn family in a car , on their way to a church ) . Unfortunately , there aren't enough funny scenes to recommend the second coming of " The Omen " as a comedy . Casting Mia Farrow ( as Mrs . Baylock ) was interesting , since she so memorably provided a womb for Satan's son in the granddaddy of these films , " Rosemary's Baby " . All in all , you're infinitely better off with originals , like " Rosemary's Baby " ( 1968 ) and " The Omen " ( 1976 ) . The Omen ( 2006 ) John Moore - Liev Schreiber , Julia Stiles , Mia Farrow

There , he discovers he is a distant cousin to the country's Prince Rudolph . The prince hates Swing music , and declares that , after his coronation , the music will be banned . Swing lovers swap the identical Le Roys - and , Rudolph is thrown in his dungeon . Will he escape ? The film is far too dependent on the films it spoofs ( " The Prisoner of Zenda " ) . Given that , you can't follow the story ; for example , why does Razzenstill decide to try and rescue Rudolph ? June Allyson is the princess who seems to fall in love with the other man ; it's an interesting , but unresolved , subplot . " The Prisoner of Swing " highlight is Le Roy's expert tap dancing performance following the scene with Ms . Allyson .

Things don't go exactly as planned ( wouldn't you know it ) ; and , the heist turns into a hostage situation . " Bloody Friday " offers plenty of gratuitous violence , which must have been considerably more shocking in its day . A couple of the hostages contrast interestingly with foul-mouthed Harmstorf : Ernst Hilbich ( as Ernst ) clearly wants to be one of the boys , and Daniela Giordano ( as Dagmar ) wants nothing to do with men ( she's a Lesbian ) . Some of the performances are all right ; but , the actors are wasted in this bizarre , exploitive , and dated production .

They fight over who is to have his way with Ms . Pickford . Along comes Yankee prospector Alfred Paget , who rescues Pickford , and takes her to his cabin . Thinking Mr . Paget is like all white men , she expects to be raped ; instead , she is given food ; and , so , she falls in love with her savior . But , Paget has a sweetheart ( Dorothy Bernard ) , who sends a letter announcing her arrival . Paget goes out prospecting , and Pickford follows . He shows her a gold stone , and she promises to let him know if she should happen upon one . Pickford returns to her own , savage people ; but , she remembers her promise . Pickford goes unbelievably overboard in her gratitude , later in the film . It's also possible that her " cross your heart " gesture , when she makes her promise , is meant to be a religious experience . This D . W . Griffith effort is rather more insulting than exciting . The extras are an illustrious lot .

His plans take a turn when the cyborg's human side takes control and he refuses to kill the scientist , thus threatening to expose the evil man's enterprises , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Poorly produced in Italy , and poorly dubbed in English as " Hands of Steel " - this is a , consequently , poor " Terminator " movie imitation . Star cyborg Daniel Greene ( as Paco Queruak ) is a handsome bodybuilder . Cool blonde Janet Agren ( as Linda ) brings out his " human " side . George Eastman and Claudio Cassinelli ( his last feature ) are okay ; and , John Saxon phones one in . Mr . Greene's battle with the female cyborg is the highlight .

452391	15896852	50558	2.0	Feeding the Myth Monster	" The James Dean Story " is introduced as " A different kind of motion picture , " explaining , " The presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material , tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of the still photograph . " The only " tape recordings of his voice " noteworthy is one short recording Mr . Dean make while visiting his family in Indiana ; he wanted to record any family recollections of his great-grandfather Cal Dean , intrigued because he played a similarly named " Cal " in " East of Eden " . Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art , and learns the relative was an auctioneer . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family , obviously . That's the only 100 % accurate revelation in this documentary . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family . An amazing " screen test " / " outtake " from " East of Eden " appears near the film's end . It's a black and white scene between Dean ( as Cal Trask ) and co-star Richard Davalos ( as Aron Trask ) . Dean is at his mesmerizing best . If this scene appeared only here , and no " East of Eden " film was completed , this documentary would be an essential , high rated film . But the scene , a perfect " 10 " in isolation , should be considered an " East of Eden " extra . Dean's " Traffic Safety Film " is also worth seeing . There are the expected interviews with family and friends . My favorites were the guy ( Lew Bracker ) going through a box of stuff Dean left with him , and Dean's family . There wasn't enough from Aunt Ortense and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice . More reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome . Dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film ; filmmakers might have considered developing it a main focus . Robert Altman's direction of Martin Gabel's reading of Stewart Stern's script is dreadful . What were they thinking ? Perhaps , filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of Dean's passing . Don't expect " The James Dean Story " at all . This movie is more about Dean's effect on people ( both the fans and filmmakers ) than the man . It is very clearly an early piece of the James Dean myth-making " legend " . Tommy Sands sings " Let Me Be Loved " . The narrative refers to Dean as " He " with a god-like air . The shots of Dean's family seeming to " know " the moment he dies are truly wretched . The James Dean Story ( 1957 ) Robert Altman - James Dean , Martin Gabel , Richard Davalos

Hoping to break free from the control of the woman who raised her , the young woman finds she must confront the priestess in order to save her own life , as well as those the priestess intends to harm , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Voodoo ? Hocus-pocus ? Racist ? Trash ! The most astonishing thing about " Chloe , Love Is Calling You " is that it was directed by Marshall Neilan . One of the most well-known filmmakers of the 1920s , Mr . Neilan's films were once eagerly anticipated . He was especially successful in partnership with Mary Pickford ( see " Stella Maris " ) . Beautiful star Olive Borden ended her ten-year film career as " Chloe " , unfortunately . It also offers a good look at handsome Reed Howes ( as Wade ) and handsome Philip Ober ( as Jim ) , who was Vivian Vance's volatile husband ( off-screen ) during " I Love Lucy " .

The son of the bank president , from which the money was stolen , tracks down the girl to recover the money , but falls for the girl and must protect her from an unscrupulous guide , who wants the money for himself , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The " stock footage " is so obvious , it's annoying . Co-stars Buster Crabbe ( as Ray Gorman ) and Julie London ( as Doreen Stockwell ) are in very good shape . Mr . Crabbe gets to show off his chest , but Ms . London remains covered . Crabbe plays his scenes with London notably well ( like a muscular Ozzie Nelson ) . In her first appearance on film , London is very beautiful . Since Ray " Nbongo " Corrigan plays the gorilla named " Samson " , probably " Nabonga " means gorilla in another language .

Pickford was one of the greatest early film performers ; and , this , her first sound offering , is an artistic failure . The Helen Hayes play " Coquette " ( 1927 ) might have seemed like an ideal way to introduce a talking Pickford . Sadly , it may have contributed to her impending retirement from films ; and , Pickford continued to choose some questionable film projects . The opening scenes , with Pickford positively awful as the coquettish southern belle " Norma Besant " , are embarrassing . If you can get used to the characters , later scenes may marginally repair the damage ; in fact , the much admired " trial " and " cabin " breakdown scenes earned Pickford a " Best Actress " Oscar .

Balleau has set his sights on a new quarry , those unfortunate enough to stumble upon his island . Now realizing what they're up against , the teen-agers must elude their host in the hopes of making ( it ) off the island alive , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The sleeve's synopsis is inaccurate in describing the group of four as " teen-agers " . They are quite clearly " young people " in their 20s ; however , the film is funnier if you think of them as teenagers . Leading the group is tall Robert Reed ( as Johnny Randall ) , inappropriately paired with the shorter female , June Kerry ( as Betty Scott ) . Probably , followers of " The Brady Bunch " will enjoy seeing Mr . Reed before he essayed his most famous role . " Bloodlust ! " is better than your average " Brady Bunch " episode , but Reed doesn't demonstrate the same ability to make the most of a bad situation . Ralph Brooke's " Most Dangerous Game " hunter Wilton Graff ( as Balleau ) doesn't help much . Supporting performances vary . Bloodlust !

Best of the women is Shelley Fabares , the spoiled rich girl interested in Elvis . She , and the man who plays her father ( Carl Betz ) were both on " The Donna Reed Show " . Ms . Fabares , Mr . Betz and flunkie Warren Berlinger are more entertaining than the others . Presley's good " Spinout " songs are not presented well , visually ; the film attempts to hide his overweight status , with varying success . Presley's movements are noticeably stiff and ungraceful during the musical numbers . Ms . Walley , with her hair , make-up , and tight pants , does not look like a boy . Well past the point where he didn't need to , Elvis isn't trying . Spinout ( 1966 ) Norman Taurog - Elvis Presley , Shelley Fabares , Diane McBain

Crisp gets to end a speech with director / writer Arthur Pierson's obtuse observation , " When this country was first discovered , there was nothing here . " Marilyn Monroe ( as Iris Martin ) has a relatively small , but pointed , secretarial role . It probably goes without saying that Ms .

To combat their war weariness , the group have some coffee , and hear the story of Jesus Christ . Christ's Hill was " Hill Number One " , where he was crucified . In flashback , the story shifts to tell the main story - - of Christ's resurrection . After Christ's death , a surprised Pilate witness several of his people are being converted to Christianity . Following his mother Mary's lead , the followers of Jesus recite " The Lord's Prayer " . Many people celebrate Christ's resurrection . Back in the present , the soldiers learn their allies have taken another Hill . Lastly , viewers are led in a Catholic prayer . This was produced on a limited budget , for a specific purpose ; and , understandably , it is not a great production . Ruth Hussey and Leif Erickson star as Mary ( the mother ) and Pilate . They are both memorable in their roles , considering the production limitations . Ms . Hussy emotes properly , and Mr . Erickson looks almost on the road to conversion in probably the most memorable performance . There are familiar and unfamiliar players - - some good and some bad . Most notable is , of course , James Dean , in his first available screen performance . There isn't much sign of the later Dean . I believe he comes on about 20 minutes in , if you want to skip to that part . He receives his cue from a line Mary says ; so look for Ruth Hussey as Mary , as Dean's cue comes after she begins . It looks like a ' bit " , but he comes back into the story . Roddy McDowall plays a Christian soldier ( the " Professor " ) in the " present " , and has no scenes with Dean .

When cub reporter Bobbie Logan puts Mr . Wong on the case , the result is a foregone conclusion , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Boris Karloff politely bows out of the lackluster " Mr .

This time , as always , Wong uses his wiser " oriental mind " to unravel a mystery that nobody else can see ( don't bother trying to solve it at home ; there really isn't a solvable mystery to be found ) . Cute and bubbly Marjorie Reynolds ( as Bobbie Logan ) does appear . So does Grant Withers ( as Bill Street ) , who , as Ms . Logan notes , " always arrests the wrong man .

Edmund McDonald ( as Ross Lambert ) leads the evil-doers . The story is slight . Mr . Burnette and Mr . Hayes team-up for a ludicrous " two-men-in-the-horse " joke . This , and action sequences appear to have been speeded up for dramatic and / or comic effect . The film includes a generous , interesting amount of location work ; climaxing with a storm-drenched river scene . Unfortunately , the relatively low budget makes certain sequences appear more technically incompetent than exciting . Song highlights are when Mr . Rogers sings with Riverboat workers , on " Who's Gonna Help Me Sing ? " and " The River Robin " . Heart of the Golden West ( 1942 ) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers , Smiley Burnette , George ' Gabby ' Hayes

Dale Evans ( as " Helen " ) is a reporter with a nose for news , and a penchant for trouble . Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers sing " Hot Lead " and shoot the breeze . " Bells of San Angelo " is full of absurdities . Mr . Devine's dogs and raccoon keep the production looking perpetually infantile - one of the dogs even tosses a bad guy over a cliff . There are several scenes with Mr . Rogers and Ms . Evans ( especially Ms . Evans ) performing quite well , but the production does not give them a proper outlet for their obvious charm and ability ; they shine in the " Robin Hood " scene , and during a couple of songs ( like " I Love the West " ) . The color photography is nice , but the film is lackluster . Bells of San Angelo ( 1947 ) William Witney - Roy Rogers , Dale Evans , Andy Devine

The plot isn't very interesting , but the relatively large " remote control " is ; perhaps it was developed for movie plots only , however . Capt .

Harvey Lembeck's " Eric Von Zipper " falls for " Sugar " . " Bonehead " Jody McCrae meets and falls in love with Mermaid Marta Kirsten . Buster Keaton chases a bikini-clad young woman around . The music is lightly pleasant - especially when sounding like Brian Wilson's Beach Boys , as in " Cycle Set " , for example . Mermaid Kirsten's was the storyline I found the most enchanting . Kirsten the Mermaid was on " Lost in Space " as Judy Robinson . Michael Nader could have had a bigger part . As far as the low points , it's difficult to pick one - there are so many weak elements of " Beach Blanket Bingo " - possibly , it's Eric Von Zipper's solo song .

Slater . Mr . Slater douses the head punk with his vanilla drink , and the Slaters take off for a swim . While the Slaters take a dip , the toughs steal Christian's scooter , which they later trash . Helen goes to the head tough's dad , and demands just over $600 . 00 ; or , the value of her little brother's scooter . Then , oops , the punk's father is accidentally shot . The Slaters go on the lam ; soon , they hook up with Keith Gordon ( as Lloyd ) , to provide a love interest for Helen . They become famous rebels for the youth set , adopting the motto " Fair Is Fair " . " The Legend of Billie Jean " starts out fun ; but , it is brought down by a truly wretched finale .

" On the strategically located Philippine island of " Corregidor " , the good doctors get to see some of the war action . Stock footage is flown in . Of course , Ms . Landi , being a " lady doctor " , is protected from viewing " mutilated " corpses . Right .

However , blackouts , delirium , and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts . He would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart , a significantly flawed prospect , as things turns out . Mr . Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe . Redfield employs a lot of black and white , color , and trick photography to create mood . Kevin G . Shinnick ( as Dr . John Moran ) performs well , relatively speaking . It's not enough .

Rogers ' Circle R ranch from wicked New York bankers , after the cowboy hero has trouble coming up with the mortgage payments . Complicating matters : a gold-like substance is discovered on Rogers ' land . Not surprisingly , the film fails to live up to the promise of its title " Wall Street Cowboy " . Other than a " Wall St . " sign and a " New York Chronicle " newspaper , there is not much to distinguish this from any other California-located Rogers western . Fast moving transportation moves the otherwise aimless story along . Rogers sings / yodels on a few good songs , like " Ride ' em Cowboy " and " Me and the Rollin ' Hills " . Smooth , but forgettable . Wall Street Cowboy ( 1939 ) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Raymond Hatton

Johnson and Linda Arvidson like to take their little girl Dollie ( Gladys Egan ) out for afternoon walks and such . One day , vagrant Charles Inslee tries to sell Ms . Arvidson a basket . When she shines the tramp on , he gets belligerent ; then , Mr . Johnson beats him up . Seeking revenge , Mr . Inslee kidnaps the little girl . The " exciting climax " is when the barrel tumbles down a waterfall and along a river . It's not all that exciting ; the falls should have been nearer to the end of the rolling on the river . . . By " Way Down East " ( 1920 ) , Mr . Griffith had the waterfalling excitement correctly presented . " The Adventures of Dollie " is more silly than adventurous . The Adventures of Dollie ( 1908 ) D .

Griffith does not recognize the beguiling " nun " he meets is really Ms . Arvidson . The two dance , and flirt . Ms . Arvidson doesn't know whether to be furious or flattered . After the two separate , and change costumes , hilarity and mistaken identity ensue . The main comic point is that Arvidson has changed her costume with the couple's " colored " maid . Edward Dillon and Robert Harron are notable cast members , the latter in a typical messenger boy role . Most notable for the " split screen " costume changing scene . Directed not by Griffith , but by Wallace McCutcheon . Griffith and Arvidson were real life husband and wife ; and , she is the standout performer " At the French Ball " .

Soon , Rottger wins freedom , and seeks revenge against Mr . Hart , in a " Chariot Race " . For the famed Chariot Race , the two stars simply ride by a stationary camera , while costumed people cheer . The good folks at Kalem ( the film company responsible ) were counting on viewers to have either seen " Ben-Hur " on stage , or read the Lew Wallace book . And , undoubtedly , most 1900s flicker watchers had the prior knowledge necessary to understand the action . This film highlights the inferiority of the medium , at that time . Director Olcott and Gene Gauntier , who was credited with having written the " Ben Hur " scenario , would have much greater artistic success with films like " From the Manger to the Cross " ( 1912 ) .

Mr . Burton's " Divorce His " aired February 6 , 1973 . Ms . Taylor's " Divorce Hers " aired February 7 , 1973 . Carrie Nye ( as Diana Proctor ) and Gabriele Ferzetti ( as Turi Livicci ) play the " other woman " and " other man " . The children outperformed their illustrious elders . This sure sounded like a good idea - - divorce told from the differing husband / wife points of view ; with notorious divorcées , and terrific performers , Taylor and Burton in the lead roles . The result is startlingly dull . There are few reasons to care whether the couple divorces , or not . The differing perspectives are slight , and uninteresting . And , don't expect any boozy " Virginia Woolf " - type arguments . Although it's highly irrelevant , or should be , it must be said that Taylor looks very beautiful in many scenes . Since the effort to display her beauty is so obvious ; I will mention she was , in my opinion , most alluring in the scene when she was in bed , in the blue nightgown , talking on the telephone .

" Everything's Ducky " for the pair when they're assigned an easy mission ; in " Operation Bird Brain " , they are to set free a recently dead officer's duck . The sailors become attached to " Scuttlebutt " , the duck who can talk . Mr . Hackett and Mr . Rooney take the duck out drinking , and become financially attached to Scuttlebutt . They try to save their feathered friend from Navy officers , who want to cut the bird's brain out . Contrived lunacy as in the hands of Hackett and Rooney is criminal . This film is both unfunny and unpleasant . Despite Scuttlebutt's boasting he can handle a few martinis , the duck gets roaring drunk . The sight of the drunken , neck-wobbling duck is unsettling . It's also obvious filmmakers have put some irritant in the duck's mouth , in close-ups , to make it appear to be talking . The duck looks very uncomfortable . Jackie Cooper ( as Parmell ) makes an impressive re-appearance on film , after a long absence ; his appearance is mercifully short , considering the star-billing , and weakness of material . And , singer Joanie Sommers ( as Nina ) appears , without singing . Everything's Ducky ( 1961 ) Don Taylor - Buddy Hackett , Mickey Rooney , Jackie Cooper
452451	15896852	74475	2.0	Abort !	" A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being . His work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days . His latest creation is a ( spoiler omitted ) , but side effects from the process ( spoiler omitted ) , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " Embryo " opens by promising : " The film you are about to see is not all science fiction . It is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb . It could be a possibility tomorrow ? or today , " according to Dr . Charles M . Brinkman III . Right . And , Dr . Joyce Brothers appears , later , at a party with Roddy McDowall . First , we see Rock Hudson ( as Dr . Paul Holliston ) light a cigarette and drive recklessly ( watch that speedometer ! ) during a storm ; unfortunately , he hits a dog . Mr . Hudson takes the wounded canine home . He learns it is pregnant , and manages to save the life of one of the puppies , due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth . What this really boils down to is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo , so that it can survive outside the mother's womb . The dog , " Number One " , grows to adult-size rapidly , and is passed off as its mother . Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd ( as Martha Douglas ) ; since his wife Nicole , also a doctor , died in another car accident . Ms . Ladd seems more emotionally stable about Nicole's death than Hudson , who survived the crash that killed his wife . Things begin to get creepy when Hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog . Then , Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human , Barbara Carrera ( as Victoria Spencer ) . Hudson and the cast try their best ; but , the " Embryo " storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense . If you take away her silly opening and closing scenes , Ms . Carrera's valiant characterization almost works ; she might have been a bigger star , if offered better films than this . The infantile ending suggests a sequel ; but , happily , the idea was aborted .

Solter out of the house . Undaunted , he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope . Ms . Arvidson is agreeable , and goes to pack . Then , burglar George Gebhardt arrives to rob the place . Though he doesn't get much in the way of booty , thieving Gebhardt manages to use Arvidson's trunk to escape from the police ? A Contrived Comedy . Note , during the balcony scene , Solter goes off-camera , so burglar Gebhardt can enter the house undetected . And , Arvidson travels very light , since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk ; perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau Solter ? Director D . W . Griffith , Robert Harron , and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras .
452397	15896852	641	2.0	Shotgun Wedding Spinster	Mabel Stoughton is a large-nosed woman who is , apparently , fond of ridiculous hairstyles . She reads ( presumably ) " The Three Ages " , and has a yen for men . She finally snags one , assisted by her father's shotgun ; and , they proceed to the altar . The intended groom escapes , which leads the entire wedding party on a merry chase ? Notable for the New Jersey location footage featured prominently in the ending chase . Ms . Stoughton looks appropriately ridiculous , and could have had a more successful film career with better material . D . W . Griffith make an on-screen appearance , alongside his Biograph troupe . The supporting cast includes a " silly Negro " , with Mack Sennett , Harry Solter , and George Gebhardt . All in all , not very funny .

Later , the gypsy woman trails Judge Solter to his home , seeking revenge . Home , the Judge and wife Florence Lawrence are preoccupied with Christmas - - he is sneaking around a packaged frock for her ; and , she has wrapped a rifle for him . Little Gladys Egan , their daughter , is ( presumably ) looking forward to the arrival of Santa Claus ; instead , Gypsy Lenard climbs in through the window , ready to enact her terrifying revenge ? Director D . W . Griffith's 1908 Christmas gift to filmgoers doesn't quite deliver the goods ; though , the final scene captures the spirit of the season . Mainly , " An Awful Moment " climaxes with an often filmed set-up involving : a bound and gagged woman , a gun , and a string . In this film , the awful moment isn't very suspenseful . Probably due to camera and budget restrictions , it's not very clear how a rescue is to be achieved ; additionally , you have to assume this family takes some heavy sleeping potion - - little Gladys is an especially heavy Christmas Eve sleeper !
453418	15896852	659	2.0	On the March	An Irishman comes home too find his family being visited by a bill collector ; so , the father throws the man out . The bill collector enlists the local police , and chaos ensues . As events unfold , the story gets rather confusing . Edward Dillon and D . W . Griffith appear , the latter in a minor role as actor " Lawrence Griffith " . Mr . Griffith doesn't seem to have offered much suggestion to director Wallace McCutcheon or cameraman G . W . Bitzer . The story was , perhaps , too ambitious for the effort given . The " Caught by Wireless " stage is interesting , with its timely desk and calendar . Interestingly , the errand boy is not played by Robert Harron . Mr . Harron stated that his school friend James Smith , who also joined Griffith's team , played similar such roles , circa 1907-'08 .

Otherwise , this movie is really , Really , REally , REAlly , Really , REALLy , REALLY awful . Why does it exist ? Well , it looks like it might have been an entertaining stage musical ? and the Christian / Hippie seemed angle seems natural enough ? so , the filmmakers added the expanded NYC locations and sets ? and , they thought that , you know , it has a style ? albeit unsuccessful . It's interesting to see the " World Trade Center " buildings . The " All for the Best " dance around the streets , and skyscrapers , is visually clever , and well performed by Victor Garber and David Haskell . More often than not , though , the film looks exuberantly ludicrous . Godspell ( 1973 ) David Greene - Victor Garber , David Haskell , Lynne Thigpen

While he's chopping down trees , a huge Eagle swoops down and kidnaps his unattended baby . Mother emerges and discovers the Eagle has taken her child ; she picks up a rifle , but , wisely , thinks before shooting at the airborne pair . Instead , she goes to get Griffith and his fellow woodsmen , who must see that the baby is " Rescued from an Eagle's Nest " . Notable for its star , Lawrence Griffith , who would soon begin unprecedented success as film Director D . W . Griffith . The " special effects " look very phony - - and , that baby has incredibly odd looking feet , while in flight ! Griffith's final battle with the Eagle is mildly interesting , but there isn't much else here . It might have been a fair film if Edison and company had the bird nesting in a tree cut , or likely to be chopped down , by the woodsmen . Or , they could have made the bird a Vulture ?

Taken in by a German doctor and his strange wife , the trio discovers the island inhabited by zombies under the control of Dr . Sangre . The doctor is attempting to use the zombies to extract information from the missing admiral to help his country's war efforts . Through the efforts of the butler , the heroes are able to turn the tables on Dr . Sangre and set his zombies against him , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The predominance of Black actor Mantan Moreland ( as Jefferson " Jeff " Jackson ) in the film makes this a great one to watch for the " type " of racial character depicted . Pedagogical interests aside , " King of the Zombies " is a dull attempt to frighten and amuse . Strangely , Edward Kay's musical score was nominated for an Academy Award ; Mr . Kay received five score nominations in the 1940s . Henry Victor ( as Dr . Sangre ) is a Lugosi-like zombie-maker . John Archer ( as Bill Summers ) and Dick Purcell ( as Mac McCarthy ) are one too many heroes . Resident " maid " Marguerite Whitten ( as Samantha ) and " voodoo high priestess " Madame Sul-Te-Wan ( as Tahama ) easily outdistance the higher-billed women .

452853	15896852	93935	2.0	A Garden Grows Quite Contrary	Some literary masterpieces are successfully adapted to the movie screen , and some are not . Strangely , Frances Hodgson Burnett's " The Secret Garden " , which seems so naturally suited for cinematic magic , falls into the latter category . This one introduces " Mary Lennox " as an attractive adult woman , who recalls her life in Misselthwaite Manor , following the death of her parents . There , young Gennie James ( as Mary ) meets her young friends , Barret Oliver ( as Dickon ) and Jadrien Steele ( as Colin ) . There are a couple of instances where the three young stars prove themselves capable : for example , the scene with Mr . Oliver examining brown twigs upon entering the garden , and the first scene played between Ms . James and Mr . Steele . Otherwise , the young performers are uneven and / or under-rehearsed . The adult performances are serviceable , at least ; Michael Hordern ( as Ben Weatherstaff ) seems truest . The setting is lovely . The ending , in which we are led to believe one of the novel's characters practically commits suicide ( pay attention , he " knows " ) by marching off to war , should be in the " hall of fame " of wretched bastardizations . The other two children are handled only slightly less perversely . Beware . The Secret Garden ( / 87 ) Alan Grint - Gennie James , Barret Oliver , Jadrien Steele

There , they search for a fortune in lost diamonds , and mingle with natives ? " The Bowery Boys " and " Africa " do not mix . A good rest would have been preferable to this moronic , cheap , and clammy movie . The " lion scenes " are startlingly ineffective - look at them for an example of what NOT to try on a small budget . Gorcey appears alternately tired and angry . Hall is stuck with absolutely humorless material . Curvy Laurette Luez plays a luscious jungle girl in modest one-piece , Woody Strode collects a paycheck , and Clint ( " Cheyenne " ) Walker has a memorable film cameo debut as " Tarzan " , just before the curtain closes on " Jungle Gents " .

Ronald Reagan is a college professor who seeks to prove " nurture ' more important than " nature " by playing house with Diana Lynn ( surrogate mother ) and Chimpanzee - Bonzo . The homey environment will prove " bad " monkeys can be " good " monkeys ( just like people ) with a little family love and understanding ! The premise is ludicrous , of course - but , it's really only done to set-up a situation to make a movie starring Bonzo the Chimp . Bonzo is fine . How is he supposed to know the story is illogical ? Since it has a chimpanzee to share scenes with , the movie is disjointed - for example , witness this sequence : Bonzo escapes into a tree , is joined by Reagan in an obviously different tree , drops eyeglasses to nowhere , jumps into the house in time for the next scene , then shocks everyone by escaping from the house ! It all manages to looks even worse than it is ; assisted , obviously , by a low budget . Bedtime for Bonzo ( 1951 ) Frederick De Cordova - Ronald Reagan , Diana Lynn , Walter Slezak

A self-described " boozing man , " Mr . Marvin likes to live under the influence . Like Mr . Eastwood , Marvin also likes to sing . The two men become companions , sealing their relationship with a simple exchange : Marvin says , " I like you Pardner , " and Eastwood says , " I like you Ben . " Since they are heterosexual , Marvin buys beautiful Jean Seberg ( as Elizabeth ) to be their wife . At $800 , Ms . Seberg's a steal . Simply put , " Paint Your Wagon " is a too long , stupid , and wasteful movie . But , it didn't have to be ? Since the studio was obviously spending money , why didn't somebody suggest paying Frank Sinatra to do Marvin's role , and giving Elvis Presley whatever Colonel Parker was asking , to take Eastwood's part ? Then , think about the fun in casting " Elizabeth " . The mind boggles . Anyway , the musical highlights are Marvin's " Wandrin ' Star " ( late in the film ) and Harve Presnell's " They Call the Wind Mariah " ( early in the running time ) .

The film's highlight is its generous location footage . Not New Mexico , of course , but California ; and there are specific sequences are from rocky Vasquez Park , according to IMDb data . Otherwise , this is a very rushed looking western . Produced off of the Roy Rogers Republic western-production-line , with the expected quality control . Mr .

Suddenly , without warning , dozens of passengers simply vanish into thin air . But it doesn't stop there . It soon becomes clear that millions of people are missing from around the world . As chaos and anarchy engulf the world , both men set out on vastly different paths in a desperate search for answers , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Like Mr . Cameron says , " There's no denying The Truth . " If you were deaf and blind , you would , still , find that this movie stinks - to high heaven . Anyone but a true believer in the theological perspective presented has a right to be offended . So , it's better to seek redeeming qualities in other ways . The performances , as a whole , aren't inspired - but , they are , at least , serviceable . It's nice to see Colin Fox at work , and Gordon Currie makes a good impression . " Left Behind " cannot be saved , however . For what it's worth , the story could be engaging - but , as soon as it gets moderately interesting , it's over . How can a Christian God terrorize these non-believers ? How is it that neither He nor the Anti-Christ are able to detect Kirk Cameron's goodness ? Perhaps , God doesn't save Cameron after his epiphany in the toilet because He has a plan for Cameron ? Perhaps , the Anti-Christ is keeping knowledge regarding Cameron's true feelings secret ? Perhaps , a sequel in in the offering ? Pass it over . Left Behind ( / 01 ) Vic Sarin - Kirk Cameron , Brad Johnson , Gordon Currie
453395	15896852	507835	2.0	( Yes , He's ) The Great Pretender	This week's concluding half-hour begins by documenting Hurkos ( Albert Salmi ) ' s work with Dr . Lars Lindstrom ( Alf Kjellin ) , a likely parapsychologist . The doctor puts Hurkos through the obligatory ESP ( extra sensory perception ) tests . Hurkos does very well - but , really , how could he not ? " God gave such a gift , " it's explained . Then , Hurkos helps police find murders , like bowling alley worker Andrew Prine ( as Walter Bird ) . Later , Hurkos claimed to have identified both the Boston Strangler and Charles Manson . Finally , the real Hurkos is brought on camera by host John Newland . Not very convincing . The Peter Hurkos Story , pt 2 ( / 60 ) John Newland - Albert Salmi , Andrew Prine , Peter Hurkos
453220	15896852	39892	2.0	Ronald Reagan Takes Shirley Temple in a Bizarre Act of Unnatural Love	In a small Ohio town , randy lawyer Ronald Reagan ( as Tom Bates ) is rumored to be the father , in a child-producing scandal . Eighteen years later , the child has grown into perky student Shirley Temple ( as Mary Hagen ) . " That Hagen Girl " doesn't know about her shadowy past , but intuitively feels the taint . When Mr . Reagan returns to town , both he and Temple hear the father / daughter story ( which everyone else in the cast knows ) . Reagan dismisses the story as malicious gossip , while courting Temple's teacher , Lois Maxwell ( as Julia Kane ) . Meanwhile , Temple scores with athletic Rory Calhoun ( as Ken Freneau ) . After Calhoun spontaneously weds Penny Edwards ( as Christine Delaney ) , Temple gets expelled after a wild night out with fun-loving Conrad Janis ( as Dewey Koons ) , who called Temple and Calhoun " The gruesome twosome of 1947 . " Reagan , who was impressed with Temple's performance as " Juliet " in her school play , offers to pay for her University education . Temple takes it as fatherly interest ; but , Ronald Reagan is falling in love with young Shirley Temple ? This is a very strange film . The now not-so-shocking " romance " between the older Reagan and younger Temple is overshadowed by their timelessly unconvincing and unappealing performances - at no time do they EVER seem like they are falling in love . The supporting players , several in early appearances , are a few notches better . Certainly , young Janis realizes the full potential of his ( " Dewey Koons " ) role - something this adept and entertaining actor would do for decades to come .

452634	15896852	878	2.0	Marion Leonard is Decked Out	At a seaside resort , almost any lady can draw the " mashers " . Marion Leonard is " The Gibson Girl " , an extraordinarily beautiful woman ; so much so , she draws a crowd of admiring followers wherever she goes . The fact that Ms . Leonard's feminine frame is always complimented by figure hugging frocks doesn't help the men stay away . Tired of the manly attention , Leonard endeavors to pretend she has fat legs ; finally , will the men leave her alone ? Marion Leonard is , indeed , a very beautiful woman . That's about it for this film . Some ambiguity among her masculine admirers adds some comic relief to D . W . Griffith's " The Gibson Goddess " .
453626	15896852	33351	2.0	Out of Bounds	Buck Jones ( as Buck Roberts ) , Tim McCoy ( as Tim McCall ) , and Raymond Hatton ( as Sandy Hopkins ) marshal their forces as " The Rough Riders " . Their first mission is to help pretty Luana Walters ( as Ruth Masters ) ; the family's " Master's Stage Line " is being robbed by wicked Tris Coffin ( as Steve Taggert ) and his gang . Also , Ms . Masters ' father has been killed by the gang . The quick drawing folks at the Monogram studio took a look at rival Republic's unprecedented success with their " The Three Mesquiteers " series of films and took action , producing a couple of " Threesomes " of their own . From the " Top 10 Western Box Office Star " lists , Monogram employed Mr . Jones , Mr . McCoy , and " Mesquiteer " Raymond Hatton as " The Rough Riders " . Given the western star power , " Arizona Bound " is surprisingly dull .
453150	15896852	57298	2.0	Maureen O'Hara Gets It in The End	The idea of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara performing a western-style version of " Taming of the Shrew " is a good one ; and , the film shows some promise when Ms . O'Hara arrives ; she and Mr . Wayne appear to be in good physical shape . However , the film isn't really " Shrew " - it's " McLintock ! " If that isn't easy to see , early on , it's obvious after the scene between Mr . Wayne and his character's daughter ; his oration , while hunting fowl , is not comedy . Wayne is making a statement . Shortly following this scene , his daughter receives her spanking . There are subtle " political " observations - - for example , the use of the names " George Washington " and " Hubert Humphrey " . I could accept this as a broad comedy , but numerous scenes are not comic ; I don't know how to relate those parts to the rest of the movie in anything except a negative light . If all of the film is supposed to be comic , it fails as a consistent comedy . I would recommend watching the giant " Mud Puddle " fighting scene ; then , watch the end , with Wayne chasing O'Hara through town . If you're not into John Wayne , consider avoiding " McLintock ! " McLintock ! ( 1963 ) Andrew V . McLaglen - John Wayne , Maureen O'Hara , Patrick Wayne
452874	15896852	31880	2.0	Rough Going on This Round-Up	Roy Rogers ( as Roy ) and sidekick Raymond Hatton ( as Rusty ) join Teddy Roosevelt's " Rough Riders " . Soon , they get suspended in order to " Round-up " the killer of partner Eddie Acuff ( as Tommy ) along the Mexican-U . S . border ; they discover creepy gold runners in the process . Notice how , even suspended , Mr . Rogers is able to get the Rough Riders to join in his Round-up ! This is not one of the better Roy Rogers westerns . The fighting scenes look like choreographed dances . Rogers sings / yodels " Ridin ' Down the Trail " , one of two relatively ordinary songs ; and , a stand-out moment , overall .

453332	15896852	57227	2.0	Smokey Mountain Bore	Elvis Presley plays Brunet Lieutenant Josh and his Blond " hillbilly " cousin Jodie . Brunet Elvis has to secure the family of Blond Elvis ' land for an important U . S . Army base . The Elvises wrestle and stuff ; but , they never actually kiss . Yvonne Craig stands out among the busty mountain women ; later , she was one of Batman's TV Catwomen . The fun in " Kissin ' Cousins " is not in the situation ; but in picking out the Elvis " double " in the scenes where they both appear . It's fairly easy to spot the fake Elvis . There are a lot of very well-proportioned women in bikinis running around and squealing ; today , there are more satisfying ways to find that kind of entertainment . I enjoyed the song " Tender Feeling " ; but , it's actually the song " Shenandoah " with different lyrics . " Barefoot Ballad " is the most embarrassing song . The musical highlight is the song " Kissin ' Cousins " ; but , watch for the superior version at the end , not the beginning , of the film . The material in " Kissin ' Cousins " would make one good music video . As a full-length feature film , it's shameful .

452614	15896852	299930	2.0	It Rhymes with Really ? Bad	Handsome hit-man Ben Affleck ( as Larry Gigli ) falls in love with luscious lesbian Jennifer Lopez ( as Ricki ) , after the two are assigned to take care of kidnapped retard Justin Bartha ( as Brian ) . Clearly , Mr . Bartha is in the wrong movie . Will Mr . Affleck's longing looks loosen Ms . Lopez ' steadfast hips ? This is the only movie where you will see Lopez outperform Al Pacino ( as Starkman ) - witness her very convincing monologue on " The Lips " , compared with Mr . Pacino's mind-boggling awful dissertation " The Thumb is Not a Finger " . Martin Brest's " Gigli " seems to be both well-intentioned and ill-conceived . It is also sometimes insulting and offensive . Gigli ( 2003 ) Martin Brest - Ben Affleck , Jennifer Lopez , Justin Bartha
453374	15896852	171839	2.0	The Scenic Route	A foreword tells the tale : " Thirty years ago - fate changed a fun-loving , reckless westerner into an outlaw - in the flash of a gamblers ( sic ) gun . Misfortune made Harry Tracy a killer - circumstance forced him to death by his own hand - at the climax of the greatest man hunt in history ! " That's about as exciting as it gets . Harry Tracy was a real outlaw , and this film is a heroic glorification of his criminal " life " . If it had been better presented , the Harry Tracy name might have been as well-remembered as peers like Jesse James . Along with the foreword storyline , you have Jack Hoey ( as Harry Tracy ) palling around with cell-mate Jean LaRue ( as Dave Merrill ) . After they break out of jail , Mr . Hoey falls in love with Mr . LaRue's sister Dorris Chadwick ( as Mary Merrill ) . Later on , LaRue finds out his sister was really adopted ; then , he reveals he desires Ms . Chadwick for himself . She obviously still considers it incest , and is repulsed . A better pal , Howard Chandler ( as Billy Weston ) , returns to help Hoey . Directed by Otis B . Thayer , " Tracy the Outlaw " has some nice scenery . Otherwise , it's just plain dull . Tracy the Outlaw ( 1928 ) Otis B . Thayer - Jack Hoey , Dorris Chadwick , Jean LaRue
453633	15896852	35430	2.0	Norwegian Wood	Lyle Talbot ( as Robert " Bob " Owen ) fights Nazis in Norway , during World War II . Helping him out are native son George N . Neise ( as Erik Falken ) and British wisecracker Charley Rogers ( as Harry Hall ) . Mr . Neise's old acquaintance June Duprez ( as Inga Beckering ) adds femininity and intrigue to the cast . Once engaged to Neise , Ms . Duprez has hooked up with properly accented Victor Varconi ( as Otto von Ritter ) . Mr . Varconi gets the line , " My men have vays of making you talk . " Spencer Gordon Bennet's " They Raid by Night " , subtitled " A Story of the Commandos " , features a very catchy theme song , and is good for a few unexpectedly good laughs .
452926	15896852	624848	2.0	Kurt Russell , Kid Ranger !	After rounding up some horse thieves , Chad ( Peter Brown ) and Joe ( William Smith ) happen upon a wayward Native American Indian boy . It's 14-year-old Kurt Russell ( as Grey Smoke ) made-up to look like an Indian ; he is wearing a dark wig , headband , and a few feathers in his hair . Instead of turning him in , the Rangers , especially Joe , take him under their wings . Joe bathes with the " young Indian buck " ( separate tubs ) . Chad and Joe bring him to Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) , who agrees to make him a Kid Ranger . When a gang of nine cutthroat gunslingers arrive in Laredo , Ranger Russell is ready for action ! This episode portends another interesting theory on the series ' trouble . Perhaps Neville Brand did not work well with his co-stars ; for whatever reasons , he really hadn't fully participated with them in the last five aired episodes . This time Mr . Brand appears to have been inserted briefly , in the opening scenes ; note that " Reese " is only seen with his back to the camera in the opening scenes . This was probably a stand-in for Brand , who must have recorded his close-ups separately .

452924	15896852	624877	2.0	Ranger Merry-Go-Round	Reese ( Neville Brand ) and semi-regular Claude Akins ( as Cotton " Buck " Buckmmeister ) stop gringo border bandits from robbing Spanish farmers in the southern city of San Diablo . The hapless farmers are grateful for Reese's particular mastery , and make him " Captain " of their village . While Mr . Akins tends to prisoner Ray Ballard ( as Dandy Davis ) , Reese tries to turn some of the town's farmers into soldiers . But , it's , as Reese states , like trying to make " a silk purse out of a sow's ear . " Meanwhile , Akins and his ward hear of , and search for , a lost treasure . . . Neville Brand was back at work full-time for this episode . However , co-stars Peter Brown , William Smith , and Philip Carey are completely absent . Curiously , Chad ( Brown ) and Joe ( Smith ) are " replaced " by Claude Akins and ( after the opening ) Ray Ballard . Probably , the regular co-stars took a break from this , an episode which utilized them lightly ; and , the script was re-worked . Usually , Akins replaced the absent ( or nearly absent ) Mr . Brand . Or , not . . . Laredo - The Treasure of San Diablo ( / 66 ) William Witney - Neville Brand , Claude Akins , Pedro Gonzales
452571	15896852	8639	2.0	Caught in a Harem	Bobby Vernon ( as Bobby ) and Gloria Swanson ( as Gloria ) sail to India ( " The land of elephants , and little clothes " ) , where they plan to elope . Upon arrival , Harem girls tempt Mr . Vernon , while a Rajah nabs Ms . Swanson . The Rajah has hundreds of wives , and wants Swanson in the group . Indians are upset , because only " toothless hags " are left for marriage . Vernon tries to rescue Swanson by switching clothes with her ? becoming a temporary " Harem Girl " himself , but his mission fails . So , it's up to canine Teddy , can the dog save Bobby and Gloria from the Indians ? " The Sultan's Wife " or " Caught in a Harem " is notable as the last Keystone Comedy . They didn't go out in style . The Sultan's Wife ( 1917 ) Clarence G . Badger - Bobby Vernon , Gloria Swanson , Joseph Callahan
453667	15896852	126659	2.0	Lugosi Hits the Wong Note	" A group of Chinese merchants and importers are the target of a European import firm that uses a beautiful Eurasian girl and a mad scientist as the means to put them out of business . A newspaper reporter and her dashing boyfriend learn of the problems the Chinatown businessmen are dealing with and decide to investigate , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " Shadow of Chinatown " is a feature length version of the recently released 15-part serial ; its shortened length is a welcome digestion , considering the lack of quality on display . Super hypnotist Bela Lugosi ( as Victor Poten ) is more stupefying than hypnotic . Though Mr . Lugosi gets top billing , Bruce Bennett stars ( as Martin " Marty " Andrews ) ; and , he is a serviceable serial hero . Joan Barclay and Luana Walters add feminine wiles . The players appear to have blocked their scenes , and know their lines well enough for a quick read through . Mr . Bennett has some good fighting scenes ; for example , the one atop a building , with Charles King . There is a semi-cool car chase , with 1930s automobiles and an old " Stop " / " Go " traffic signal .
452932	15896852	624865	2.0	Neville Brand Is Bound ! Whipped ! and Broken !	Everyone in Laredo is heading over to the annual fiesta in nearby San Gill . Chad ( Peter Brown ) and Joe ( William Smith ) want to join the celebration ; but , Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) assigns them office duty in Laredo . The Rangers try to trick Reese ( Neville Brand ) , returning from last week's assignment , into taking over , with limited success . Of course , the Rangers go anyway . At the fiesta , they try to avoid Parmalee ; and , later , become involved in thwarting an assassination plot . Colorful , silly , and predictable . Chad wears a Devil mask , Joe is the Rabbit , and Reese sometimes plays the Frog . Lonny Chapman guest stars ( as Julius ) . Given the festive tone of the episode , and the lightheartedness of the series , the scene featuring Reese being brutally whipped is startling . His back is covered with bloody , realistic welts , sadistically administered by Theo Marcuse ( as Waldo ) . The apparent severity of the whipping does not match the character's later antics .

452651	15896852	624882	2.0	Martin Milner Joins the Rangers	Reese ( Neville Brand ) is put down , and repeatedly falls into some mud , as prissy and proper Martin Milner ( as Clendon MacMillan ) arrives at the Rangers ' Company B , looking for work . Surprisingly , Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) hires Mr . Milner on the spot ; and sends him out on a mission with the reluctant Reese , Chad ( Peter Brown ) , and Joe ( William Smith ) . The newly formed quartet of Texas Rangers goes out to stop overweight , drunkard Cliff Osmond ( as Running Antelope ) and his tribe of Native American Indians . The boozing Mr . Osmond loots and burns towns , killing whatever gringos haven't managed to escape . Milner's foolish beliefs regarding " Indian rights " clash with the other lawmen ? The portrayal of Native American Indians reaches an unfortunate new low , in only the third episode of the series . Licorice-loving Shelly Morrison ( as Linda Little Trees ) makes her first likable , but ludicrous appearance ; interestingly , this " comic " " squaw " is noted to have participated in the series ' first documented slaughter , by jealously knocking off a comely blonde woman ! Milner's character is treated like a fool , for advocating human rights , and the rule of law ; but , the Indians on-screen certainly deserve what they get ! Milner appears in-between " Route 66 " and " Adam 12 " , sporting a longhorn moustache . Laredo - Yahoo ( / 65 ) David Lowell Rich - Martin Milner , Neville Brand , Peter Brown
452801	15896852	35396	2.0	Sunrise Sunset	Roy Rogers ( as Roy ) , George " Gabby " Hayes ( as Gabby ) , and " The Sons of the Pioneers " help guardian Helen Parrish ( as Sylvia Clark ) claim and manage the land inherited by her ward , Baby Rodney . Bagley Ranch keeper Joan Woodbury ( as Vera Martin ) and cohort Onslow Stevens ( as Jackson ) want to swindle the ranch out of the infant's little hands . The pervasive bright-as-sunlight moonlight is more distracting than usual , since the incorrect time of day referred to several times in succession . Having a baby around to serenade ups the cuteness level considerably . " Sunrise Serenade " ends as Rogers and Trigger struggle to save Frank M . Thomas ( as Sheldon ) from an approaching water rapid ; but , it isn't enough to lift the film . Sunset Serenade ( 1942 ) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Helen Parrish
453323	15896852	41149	2.0	O'Hara of Arabia	Unintentionally funny story with Maureen O'Hara as an Arab princess avenging the death of her father . She sings ! She dances ! She battles the evil " Black Robes " . Ms . O'Hara's possible knowledge of this movie's low worth may have enhanced her ludicrous performance . Vincent Price can always be depended on for an outrageous performance in an absurd film , but the hammy master is no match for O'Hara . Not a complete waste , as O'Hara and her leading man look lovely . It's got some action , and swell color . If everyone was as hammy as the leads , it might have been funnier - with more singing and dancing . Bagdad ( 1949 ) Charles Lamont - Maureen O'Hara , Paul Hubschmid , Vincent Price
453427	15896852	20902	2.0	A Fish Out of Water	Buster Keaton ( as Elmer ) is an incompetent Hollywood manager assigned to beauty contest winner Anita Page ( as Elvira ) . Robert Montgomery ( as Larry ) is around as romantic rival . Interestingly , the three main players are " stars " in the film ; however , they show little star quality in " Free and Easy " . There are several " cameos " and references to MGM stars of the time ( Garbo , Shearer , Davies , Crawford . . . ) . Mr . Keaton speaks well during early scenes ; and , he is sometimes nicely expressive . However , the film is amateurish and embarrassing . Keaton singing the title " Free and Easy " song is a low point . Keaton's sobriety is doubtful . You may find more entertaining shows at your local Elementary School . Free and Easy ( 1930 ) Edward Sedgwick - Buster Keaton , Anita Page , Robert Montgomery

Rogers faces wicked carpetbaggers , led by Cy Kendall ( as Ballard ) . Assisting Rogers is his ever present pal George " Gabby " Hayes ( as Gabby ) , who happens to have a fetching niece , Marjorie Reynolds ( as Jeanie ) . Sally Payne is along for the ride , as Belle Starr . Rogers must be the " Robin Hood " of the title , protecting the people from big tax collectors . Rogers and Ms . Payne have a cool brawl ( not with each other ) and the acting from Rogers and team are a notch above the norm . However , Rogers ' role of an ex-Confederate , in a post-Civil War setting , lends itself to some understandable questions about the representation of race - not the worst you'll see , but enough to stand out in a western with little else to notice .

In order to win FHM magazine's coveted " Hottest Sorority " contest , Ms . Hilton decides to diversify the wealthy , blonde sorority set by accepting ethnic , ugly , fat , and otherwise non-blonde pledges . Beautiful dark-haired rival Paula Garcés ( as Gloria ) makes trouble for Hilton and orally fixed boyfriend Simon Rex ( as Derek ) . Hilton's dog chows down ! The flesh is fleeting , and Hilton shows little . Fortunately , some of the other women aren't as shy . A good example of the humor is when a toilet reverse backs-up all over the screen . Worst of all , Hilton as " Victoria " has a skeleton in her closet - she was an ugly child . ( Choke ! ) Will this dark secret ruin her chances to win the " Hottest Sorority in the Country " contest ? It's nice to see performers like Mr . Rex and Alexis Thorpe ( as Morgan ) ; but , the material is not very good . So , you may want to park your car in another garage . You'll get more kicks from a " Girls Gone Wild " commercial .

The pediatrician thinks telling mothers their children are " normal , average infants " might force him to " close up shop . " Mary ( Shelley Fabares ) suspects something is amiss when her mother prepares Alex ' favorite dinner , " lamb curry " ; the last time she made it , Donna dented a fender . It's always nice to see ( and hear ) Virginia Christine , who plays the ludicrously implausible role of " Margaret Lang " , a mother ashamed of her " homely " baby ( actually , he looks fine ) . Ms . Christine was the TV ad woman for Folgers Coffee . Jeff contributes an interesting observation , " You sneer at girls and they come running . " And , as dictated by the script , we witness Mr . Betz blowing pipe smoke in Ms . Reed's face . The Baby Contest ( / 58 ) Oscar Rudolph - Donna Reed , Carl Betz , Virginia Christine

Five years later , Mr . West is a rich man . When hard times hit the old folks at home , Ms . Pickford writes West , suggesting a visit . To surprise his parents , West decides to conceal his identity . He puts on a hat , which compliments his already grown beard and moustache . When he returns , his parents don't recognize their son ; ironically , they decide to rob the wealthy young stranger while he sleeps . . . West conceals his identity by putting on a hat ? Perhaps director D . W . Griffith assumed viewers knew the parents ' eyesight was failing ? Father Prior seems in good enough health , to effortlessly lift a supposedly dead body , and carry it outside . If not for the implausibility presented concealment of the son's identity , " The Son's Return " would be an interesting drama . The Son's Return ( 1909 ) D . W .

452778	15896852	48667	2.0	Steer Clear !	This film reeks of production line planning . It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart ! June Allyson ! Anthony Mann ! Baseball ! War ! Baby ! Airplane ! - ROLL ' EM ! - The film does address the age of the Stewart / Allyson performers ; though , I'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger . There are messages in " Strategic Air Command " I found curiously shocking and offensive , but I'll stick with one truly wretched element : The happily married couple is challenged when Mr . Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife . In the film's most dramatic scene , she calls him on it . It ends completely unresolved - Allyson is crying her heart out on their bed , and Stewart walks out on her . NO discussion ; he simply says he is correct , and walks out on his devastated wife . For all he knows , she could slit her wrists . Later , Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision . Unbelievable ! Stick with Stewart-Allyson in " The Stratton Story " ( 1949 ) .

452366	15896852	51605	2.0	Chicken Little Clucks Again	Dana Andrews , Marilee Earle , and Mel Tormé are the main attractions . I don't know how anyone can play scenes with the great Mr . Tormé . I would crack up ! Mr . Andrews , Ms . Earle , and the others are incredibly awful in this film . I don't have any idea what's going on with Andrews ' physical condition ; but , he seems healthier as the film goes on . As a " cold war drama , " this movie fails . The plot and performances are ludicrous . BUT , as an unintended comedy , the movie succeeds . I found it moderately funny . I'm not sure what kind of political message this film is trying to make - but , it adds to the hilarity . I can't rate it highly , because I'm sure the filmmakers ' intentions were quite different than my reception . The Fearmakers ( 1958 ) Jacques Tourneur - Dana Andrews , Marilee Earle , Mel Tormé

453638	15896852	69159	2.0	The Dirty Dozin '	This English re-titled " A Reason to Live , A Reason to Die " is a thoroughly unconvincing United States Civil War swipe of " The Dirty Dozen " , done in the Clint Eastwood " spaghetti western " style . James Coburn ( as Pembroke ) leads a less than star-studded group of seven desperadoes . ( Still pre-Kojak ) Telly Savalas , who appeared as one of the original " Dozen " , is Mr . Coburn's major foil . Mr . Savalas ( as Ward ) has interesting taste in sculpture art . The locations are nice , but don't seem very American . The film's relatively high level of explosions , shootings , and stabbings must have been the box office draw , back in the early 1970s . Today , you only need to play a video game .

453120	15896852	36051	2.0	They Don't Know Jack	Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a " Jack London " adventure film isn't a bad idea ; certainly , he led an interesting , and sometimes adventurous , life . This film , however , winds up flat and unsatisfying . Most importantly , it lacks integrity . Michael O'Shea ( as London ) has some Londonesque speeches ; and , it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive " The Call of the Wild " after spending some quality time alone , in the snowy mountains , with his dog , " Buck " .

Mr . Guizar is also a singing cowboy . As " The Gay Ranchero " of the title , Guizar seems to have more to do than Rogers . Andy Devine ( as " Cookie " ) works at the Manzanita Springs Airline being sabotaged , and helps out singling cowboys out - and , gets helped out during the bull session . Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers add songs and laughs . This film seems to be an attempt to cross-over the audiences of American singing cowboy star Roy Rogers and Mexican singing cowboy star Tito Guizar . Or , it may be an attempt to introduce the Mexican singing cowboy star to Rogers ' U . S . audience . The resulting film is like two partial movies , either of which are very good . The cowboy stars never really operate / act as a " team " ; they have little rapport , and few opportunities to show any .

Not a war story , but a Roy Rogers western : this one a " Variety Show " of stunts , songs , and Smiley bits ? plus , a sign proclaiming : " Freedom of Speech Doesn't Mean Careless Talk " .

Stunts include setting up a giant mirror on a road to simulate a head-on car crash ; and , following another car crash , Rogers being tied up and left in a warehouse rigged to blow .

Hart finds the town sinfully in need of his services . He needn't have looked any further than his own back yard , however ; soon , Ms . Dalton decides to run off with the local sleaze , Robert McKim ( as " Doc " Hardy ) after he is nice to her in the grocery store . The Lord must have blinked when Mr . McKim winked . Thomas H . Ince's " The Disciple " is inexplicable . Hart is an odd man of God , threatening a flock at gunpoint , " Are you going ' to force me to preach to cripples ? " Dalton's abandonment of her husband and young daughter is not very plausible , assuming Hart fathered the impossibly blonde curled girl . Dalton performs well , considering the weak material ; and , perversely , her scenes with McKim look good . Although unseen , " God " is a character who becomes more and more involved in the plot , which makes it more silly than not .

Anyway , it starts out as a crime drama ; a murder is committed , apparently witnessed by a woman who gets away . Soon , there is an avalanche , causing massive destruction that completed disappears in a couple of seconds . I took the avalanche as a inside joke ; you see , this film goes nowhere but downhill . Or , it might be meant to foreshadow the end . Victor Mature ( he's Matt ) and Vincent Price ( he's Paul ) compete to see who gets the girl - - when they're not competing to see who gives the worst performance .

The last three Ken Utsui ( as Sûpâ Jaiantsu , or Super Giant ) movies , edited together for the USA ; it's understandably not very fresh , but " Evil Brain from Outer Space " features a relatively high dose of Starman action , villains , and gimmicks . After the stock footage opening all the Starman movies , a chase scene involving Balazar's brain being carried in a suitcase provides a relatively exciting opening . Balazar and his minions are better villains than not . Still , it's material reproduced down from mediocre .

Later , Ms . Swanson's younger sister Barbara Kent ( as Joan Trent ) arrives - with the lover Swanson rejected ! Swanson would rather little sister stick with boyish Arthur Lake ( as Buster Collins ) ; later , Mr . Lake will play Blondie's Dagwood Bumbstead . Star Swanson sings a couple of songs , and has an obligatory undressing / bathing scene . Considering the strong personnel involved , this is a remarkably unsatisfactory film , even for an early " talkie " . The " modern sophisticated comic " approach falls very flat ( if that's what is intended ) . There is some suggestion of more " Adult " encounters than are present in the players ' dialog - for example , Swanson breaks up with boyfriend Owsley and hands him his golf clubs ; so , what are is golf clubs doing at her place ? And , a later rain scene suggests Swanson had bedded down with the just-proposed Lyon . Swanson's portrayal is remarkably unsteady , at times , for a very accomplished actress who had already successfully transitioned from silent to sound . The material offered in " Indiscreet " couldn't have done much to advance anyone's career ; unfortunately , Swanson is particularly slighted , being the star .

The submarine is on an important mission to the North Pole - nobody is sure who it might be the spy . Along for the ride to " Ice Station Zebra " are suspects : Ernest Borgnine with a Russian accent , Patrick McGoohan being Patrick McGoohan , and Jim Brown being Jim Brown . Rock Hudson tries to keep a straight face as the mission commander . I found the movie and its characters so dull , I didn't care what happened to them . The movie's obvious expense might have been appealing in its day . The film has an intermission ; and , I wondered , how many people returned for second half ? The actors look more sweaty than cold during the film's icy end . You can find more excitement in a single episode of the old " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " TV series .

After Patton saves daughters in distress Alma and Adrian Rayford ( as Bonita and Flora Barton ) , Mr . Bertram hires him to help around the ranch . House plots to kill , while Patton and Ms . Alma fall in love ? A fairly nondescript western . Notably , the " real " Rayford sisters play the " fictional " Barton sisters - and co-star Bertram also directed . There are a lot of good location long-shots . The scenes introducing the sisters , at the beach and by a busy 1924 highway , are too brief . A little more than halfway in , the film is badly damaged , but it recovers quickly , and plays well until The End . Smoking Trails ( 1924 ) William Bertram - Bill Patton , Alma Rayford , Jack House

Mr . Buzard quickly grows into McCoy ( as old Tim Braddock ) , which is the main Braddock role . After pretty Joan Woodbury ( as Helen Brennan ) is introduced , the characters ' ages are difficult to discern . McCoy is an odd " Phantom " ; he makes no effort to hide his identity , and is plainly visible as " Slim Braddock " . He also terrorizes citizens with kindness , and makes minor repairs on the coaches he robs . The most entertaining part of " Bulldog Courage " occurs when Paul Fix ( as Bailey ) arrives to blow-up a mine ; he really uses his " noodle . " After Mr . Fix is detained , McCoy does a wild impersonation of " Bailey " ; with his obvious ability to memorize dialogue , and capture a character , " Braddock " should have been an actor instead of a minor .

You will see some good documentary-style film footage . Otherwise , it's difficult to recommend this as a FILM . It's not much more than an historical document .

Pinza likely earned his MGM feature film career after appearing in the hugely successful stage production of " South Pacific " ( 1949 ) .

Bad guys like Shane Briant ( as Paul Thoreau ) will do almost anything to get the virus back ? Interestingly , the virus stolen by Harrow destroys the body's immune system , like AIDS . It was discovered accidentally , and Harrow seems correct in her assumption about how her government would use the virus ; she doesn't trust New Zealand's military . Why she decides to , instead , deliver the virus to the United States CIA has even co-star Robertson baffled ! Despite some warming up , there isn't much characterization . The ending gives the film a lift .

No need to wonder about the vampire's identity ; it's given away during the first attack . Although the film goes to dullsville with the idea , it is intriguing to think about a plot involving the offspring of a pregnant female vampire victim .

The " old dark house " plot was dug up fairly often by Gorcey's groups ( earliest in 1940's " Boys of the City " ) , with surprisingly little success .

Can friends and colleagues like Walter Abel ( as Fuller ) , Lloyd Nolan ( as Stutz ) , James Arness ( as McMullen ) , and Andy Devine ( as Willie Moon ) locate the downed crew before they succumb to the cold winter's wrath ? " Island in the Sky " is a survival story which spends far too much of its time concentrating on the various rescuers , and not enough time on the struggling crew . Moreover , the time spent on the downed crew isn't satisfying . Although the temperature is said to be forty or seventy degrees below zero ( at Fahrenheit , no less ) , the crash survivors seldom look really cold or uncomfortable . At times , it's painfully obvious they are " acting cold " while a wind machine blows " snow " at the camera . Mr . Wayne performs some William A . Wellman-directed scenes very well , however ; especially during a missed rescue attempt . Mike Connors , Darryl Hickman , Fess Parker , and Alfalfa Switzer lend some occasional support . Also look for Mr . Devine in a poolside bathing suit , with what must be Wellman's children , Michael and Tim .

Rogers ' identity is discovered , he decides to infiltrate the local gang of terrorists known as " The Border Legion " , and make amends . . . The film opens with an amusing wheel barrel stunt introducing Mr . Hayes ; though , how he emerged intact is a mystery ! Hayes is given a comic love interest - Maude Eburne ( as Hurricane ) . Hayes plays a role other than " Gabby " , but listening carefully will reveal that doesn't always prevent Roy Rogers from calling him Gabby . Jay Novello ( as Santos ) steals the show as one of Joseph Sawyer ( as Guilden ) ' s gang . You'll wonder why Rogers leaves Santos so close to a knife and horse at the end of one scene . Mr . Novello's Santos has a unusually close relationship with his boss ; their final scene is interesting . Rogers ' songs " With My Guitar and You " and " Get Along Little Doggies " are nicely inserted . None of the pluses are enough to life " The Border Legion " aka " West of the Badlands " from mediocrity , however .

But , both the U . S . Army and Navy reject them as too young . Still wanting to " knock off about a million Japs " , the " boys " attack an Asian clerk , who turns out to be Chinese . The unfortunate incident does , however , lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty Japanese and German people . If " too young " is defined as " under twenty-one " , only Mr . Jordan and Mr . Stone would be rejected for military service . But , it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by Mr . Gorcey and Mr . Hall . " Let's Get Tough ! " was made during what the script accurately describes as " open season on Japs " - for this and other reasons , it hasn't aged well . It's a wasted effort , but the regulars performs ably , with Tom Brown moving the storyline along , as Jordan's spy brother . Let's Get Tough !

Herein , Bobby Jordan replaces Harris Berger ( as Danny Dolan ) , from the previous " East Side Kids " movie . Dave O'Brien ( as " Knuckles " Dolan ) continues as Mr . Jordan's reformed older brother . Fellow " Dead End " kid Leo Gorcey ( as Muggs McGinnis ) joins " Danny's Gang " ( after three films , Mr . Gorcey will become the undisputed leader ) . The returning junior gangsters are : Hally Chester ( as Buster ) , Frankie Burke ( as Skinny ) , Donald Haines ( as Peewee ) , and David Gorcey ( as Pete ) . This film most notably introduces former " Our Gang " member Ernest " Sunshine Sammy " Morrison ( as Scruno ) , a new member of the Bowery " kids " . Unfortunately , Mr . Morrison is included as insulting , race-based comic relief ; and , the story doesn't take advantage of Joseph H . Lewis ' relatively fine direction ( or some good locations ) . Fortunately , Morrison would be allowed to bring some integrity to the " Scruno " character ; in later films ( like " Bowery Blitzkrieg " ) he plays a more dignified humorous role . The story begins with Mr . O'Brien and well-to-do Eugene Francis ( as Algy Wilkes ) expressing concern about " Danny's Gang " , and their propensity for trouble . Their fears prove to be well-founded , as Jordan and the " Boys of the City " decide to get relief from hot New York City streets by opening up a fire hydrant . The incident lands the lads in juvenile court - but , the judge allows them cool their heels by spending some time in the country . They wind up in a spooky old mansion , with scene-stealing Minerva Urecal ( as Agnes ) . Boys of the City ( / 40 ) Joseph H . Lewis - Bobby Jordan , Leo Gorcey , Ernest Morrison
452816	15896852	19800	3.0	Losing It	For her second talking film appearance , Paramount presented Clara Bow ( as Pat Delaney ) in the audience pleasing " circus " genre , with a " Wings " co-star , Richard Arlen ( as Larry Lee ) . Although the formula seemed like a blockbuster in the making , the film was disappointing . Bow is cast in an inappropriate , and dull , " change of pace " role . She is unconvincing as the demure girl who becomes a " high wire " circus star . At one point , we are expected to believe Bow's pleasingly plump figure passes for Mr . Arlen , in a clown costume , on the high wire ! Arlen is also unconvincing , playing the tending to be tipsy alcoholic " King of the High Wire " . Kay Francis ( as Zara Flynn ) rounds out the expected " love triangle " . Bow's " stand around and wait " attempt to pry Arlen's interests from Ms . Francis ' arms is uncharacteristic . On the plus side , the cast and crew put some obvious effort into a sound production . The " Dangerous Curves " referred to in the title are plainly stated as Arlen's trials and tribulations with job , alcohol , and women . So , the film's content may have been altered to focus on Arlen , then a lesser box office star than Bow . Still , it was a Bow film , and audiences undoubtedly bought tickets to see Clara Bow's " Dangerous Curves " . And , as a Bow starring vehicle , " Dangerous Curves " was a modest success . For the year 1928-29 , Clara Bow was the US # 1 " Box Office Star " , according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications . After " Dangerous Curves " , box office receipts declined sharply . Suddenly , Clara Bow's reign was over . Dangerous Curves ( / 29 ) Lothar Mendes - Clara Bow , Richard Arlen , Kay Francis

Unfortunately , Ms . Emerson's carefully planned plot to rob the " Central Trust and Savings Bank " of $40 , 000 goes awry , when her getaway car driver , a young Jackie Gleason ( as Wilson ) , parks in the red . Big mistake . Mr . Gleason draws the attention of a passing policeman , and Emerson is left holding the bag . Love interest Frank Wilcox ( as Kenneth Phillips ) tries to keep Emerson out of women's prison . Fortunately , he is unsuccessful , and Emerson serves a intermittently amusing sentence , with Julie Bishop ( as Myrtle Reed ) , and other beautifully coiffed women behind bars .

The crazed doctor has conducted his nefarious deeds upon even his own family members , including the exchange of his own soul into his brother's body . With his soul now inhabiting a new body , the madman believes he can continue his experiments uninterrupted , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The title " House of the Living Dead " may be more an attempt to cash in on prior successful motion pictures than a reflection of what goes on in this movie . The story might have been above average , with the cast and crew involved ; but , the execution is severely flawed . The lugubriously languid production picks up ( slightly ) in the last quarter . Leading man Mark Burns ( as Michael and Breck ) tries awfully hard ; he maintains an long screaming scene remarkably well . Shirley Anne Field is a welcome attraction . But , the movie doesn't work .
453128	15896852	37151	3.0	One Remake Too Many	One Body Too Many ( 1944 ) Frank McDonald - Jack Haley , Jean Parker , Bela Lugosi " A timid insurance salesman decides to place a call upon an eccentric recluse at his mansion only to find that he has just passed away . What he also finds is a home full of relatives who are , according to the will , all bound to remain in the mansion until the authorities arrive to claim the body . Seeing that the man's niece may be in harm's way , the salesman decides to remain at the mansion to protect her from harm while they discover who killed their uncle , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . A thinly disguised re-make of the relatively recent re-make of silent spoof " The Cat and the Canary " . Possibly , the very successful Bob Hope version of 1939 had been removed from circulation ; and , movie producers felt the story had more traction . Otherwise , it's difficult to explain this inferior treatment . Star Jack Haley ( as Albert Tuttle ) is curiously ill-suited in the leading role . Still , it's enjoyable to see Mr . Haley without his " Tin Man " silver . And , leading lady Jean Parker ( as Carol Dunlap ) is an attractive old dark house inhabitant . The most entertaining of the cast are spooky servants Bela Lugosi ( as Murkil ) and Blanche Yurka ( as Matthews ) . Dependable Lucien Littlefield ( as Kenneth Hopkins ) was also in the 1927 version . Writers Winston Miller and Maxwell Shane do add some witty new lines and situations to the formula ; but , the resulting product compares very unfavorably with earlier versions .

There is a budget , and nice Paris photography , but the film just doesn't work . Ms . Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe . That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell . Some of the other players are WAY out of their element . There are several embarrassing scenes ; most of all , be warned : there is a musical number where boneheaded African cannibals " cook " the brunettes in a pot , after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit . This is an interesting , at times embarrassing , waste of resources . Gentlemen Marry Brunettes ( 1955 ) Richard Sale - Jane Russell , Jeanne Crain , Alan Young

He is really out for her jewels , but picks up the briefcase as an afterthought . Unbeknownst , he has acquired a notebook filled with top secret spy formula doodling - the stuff men KILL , and DIE , for ! This film begins with fluid direction from William Witney , mirrored cat-like burgling by Mr . Hogan , and cool soundtrack music from Buddy Bregman . As the plot develops , the film unravels . The soundtrack becomes annoyingly repetitive . The characters get lost in a wildly illogical story ; possibly the most incredible element is the bonding ( love ? ) of the characters played by Mr . Hogan and Ms . Kenney . The players continue to try , however ; and , the warehouse climax is nicely shot . The Cat Burglar ( 1961 ) William Witney - Jack Hogan , June Kenney , John Baer

( as Gabby Watters ) go undercover to investigate . Secret Service head John Litel ( as Saxby ) gives Mr . Reagan the identity of dead spy " Steve Swenko " . Reagan seeks James Stephenson ( as Joe Garvey ) , who is being investigated for " Un-American Activities " . Reagan has to deal with detectives pulling off his shirt to strip search him . Then , he must handle beautiful blonde Lya Lys ( as Hilda Riker ) ; the wife of the man he is supposed to be impersonating orders Reagan , " Talk fast and give the right answer ! " Eventually , the plot leads Reagan to board " The U . S . Dirigible ' Mason ' " - apparently , so that filmmakers can edit in some exciting footage of a Hindenburg-type airship . Reagan , now undercover as seaman " Steve Coe " , is ordered to destroy the airship " Mason " because it carries a new U . S . Defense weapon called the " Inertia Projector " . This weapon , according to the script , " makes the United States invincible in war . " Who , and what , will survive " Murder in the Air " ? This is a patchwork movie for the future President .

452859	15896852	28517	3.0	A Woman's Story Is Executed	Willful , independent-minded Katharine Hepburn ( as Pamela Thistlwaite ) grows up in Victorian England , alongside her pretty sister Elizabeth Allan ( as Flora Thistlewaite ) . When stern father Donald Crisp ( as Byron Thistlewaite ) presents his young lasses to polite society , they quickly pair up and get pregnant . Ms . Hepburn makes it with young Van Heflin ( as Gerald Waring ) , while Ms . Allan fetches dashing David Manners ( as Alan Freeland ) . Then , tragedy strikes their lives ? Most of the original cast is disposed with ; in a storyline that seems , at times , to be presented " in code " . Still , it's possible to discern what's going on , if you're paying attention . Basically , Hepburn is raising her sister's child as her own , due to Victorian-era sensibilities . Over the years , Hepburn grows into a successful feminist writer . Important cast members joining the " soap opera " are Herbert Marshall ( as Thomas Lane ) and Doris Dudley ( as Flora " Floss " Junior ) . Hepburn's " dark secret " rears its ugly head , after a couple of decades . It is most astonishing to see Ms . Dudley , playing Hepburn's daughter , look more like her mother , when they share the screen . How is it that nobody noticed ? The production looks first class , at least . And , most of the acting is valiant ; particularly effective is Mr . Heflin , in his film debut . But , the good story idea in " A Woman Rebels " is so poorly executed , it's a travesty .

There is a very good reason : best friend Jack Carson saved Mr . Reagan's life during World War II and Reagan married Lily to help his buddy out - you see , Lily needs an American husband to obtain passage to the USA . Meanwhile , Mr . Carson has married another woman ? Even for the time , the comedy dialog in " John Loves Mary " must have sounded remarkably unsophisticated ; listen , for example , to the scene when Reagan explains how he dealt with " loneliness " during his four years of service . The performances match the low average nature of the proceedings . Most notable as Patricia Neal's ( inauspicious ) movie debut .

453275	15896852	6359	3.0	South of the Border	In the days before the Great War ( aka World War ) I ) , in the Caribbean Sea , the tiny nation of Paragonia nestled . Soon , the " jewel set in the girdle of the earth " would need All-American Douglas Fairbanks to settle unrest . In the spring of 1910 , a New York mining company's contract with the Republic comes up for renewal . Paragonia's " Minister of War " Carl Stockdale ( as Salsa Espada ) is alone in opposing the renewal ; he thinks Americans are " pigs " , and wants to rule the Republic . President Spottiswoode Aiken ( as Hernando de Valdez ) and Premier Tote du Crow ( as Alberto de Castille ) have their way , and the contract is signed . Meanwhile , Mr . Aiken's comely daughter Alma Rubens ( as Juana de Valdez ) attracts suitors like Charles Stevens ( as Colonel Gargaras ) . In New York City , young mining engineer Douglas Fairbanks ( as " The Americano " ) is offered a job in Paragonia . At first , Fairbanks refuses ( " Too far from Brooklyn ! " ) - - but , when he sees fetching Ms . Rubens visiting the American Mining Company office , he is smitten . Upon arrival , Fairbanks finds the dictatorial Mr . Stockdale has taken over the country , and thrown its popular president in prison . Moreover , Rubens is being forced into an unhappy marriage ? This was the last , and not the best , of the Fairbanks " Triangle " films supervised by D . W . Griffith . The acclaimed director's influence can be seen occasionally , in the film's relatively elaborate structure , and characterizations . For example , Reubens is introduced petting a bird . And , while it wasn't only Griffith who employed offensive black-faced characters like Tom Wilson ( as Harold Armitage " Whitey " White ) , he created this role for Wilson ( who pets his lucky rabbit's foot ) . The Mexican locale is a highlight .
452990	15896852	56606	3.0	The Price is Low	Vincent Price fails to illuminate Richard III - possibly this is due to the direction of Roger Corman , and the resources available to the filmmakers . It's interesting to watch Mr . Price and the others attempt this odd version of Shakespeare ; if you're not a fan of either , you probably won't enjoy this " Tower of London . " Mr . Price as Richard kills many in his quest for the throne . Some of the deaths are ( suggestively ) quite disturbing , but the victims ' " ghosts " are incredibly silly-looking . They act silly , too . The hero and heroine are played by Robert Brown and Joan Freeman - I thought their characterizations were okay ; they seemed to know what their roles were and what kind of movie they were performing in , unlike some others in the cast . Tower of London ( 1962 ) Roger Corman - Vincent Price , Robert Brown , Joan Freeman
452973	15896852	120757	3.0	Broken Hip	The DVD sleeve explains the premise : " Three problem teens are headed for jail , " and are " set to do time until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover . " The film opens with definitions of the words " Mod " and " Squad " , so you won't have to look them up in the dictionary . For a visual definition of " Cool " , search for photographs of the original threesome : Michael Cole ( as Pete Cochran ) , Clarence Williams III ( as Linc Hayes ) , and Peggy Lipton ( as Julie Barnes ) . One black . One white . One blonde . Once they defined cool . The three who make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's " The Mod Squad " are twentysomethings : Claire Danes ( as Julie Barnes ) , Giovanni Ribisi ( as Pete Cochran ) , and Omar Epps ( as Linc Hayes ) . They aren't able to do much with the material given . Mr . Ribisi's portrayal is the most " far out " , meaning he digresses most from the original characterization . Ms . Danes romances Josh Brolin ( as Billy Waites ) , who looks like he could be in a re-make of " Marcus Welby , MD " . You won't believe hefty Michael Lerner dancing with Mr . Epps ' " Linc " . He explains , " I'm not a fairy , I just like to dance ! " and requests , " Spin me ! " The Mod Squad ( 1999 ) Scott Silver - Claire Danes , Giovanni Ribisi , Omar Epps

Having idolized his brother to the point of it being an obsession , the young man cannot believe he was guilty , even though he was , and swears to avenge him . The crazed young man decides to carry out his revenge by tracking down and killing all the officials and jurors responsible for his brother's trial and execution , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Boris Petroff's " Anatomy of a Psycho " is a pale period piece , which seemingly sought to ( given the title ) bask in the glow of two significantly more timeless films . It might have been interesting had it tweaked the covertly homosexual relationship between Darrell Howe ( as Chet Marco ) and Frank Kiliman ( as Bobby Brown ) , for starters . By the way , it's easy to mistake Mr . Howe for Ronnie Burns ( as Mickey Craig ) , due to the latter's star billing . Mr . Burns , who plays a slightly more secondary role to Mr . Howe's " bad boy " lead , was the more well-known actor , due to his appearing from 1955-'59 on his parents ' TV series . Relax , Ronnie does not stray too far from his familiar role as the nice young son of George Burns & Gracie Allen .

As they plot a hilarious heist that could make - or break - their futures , the students grow closer , never suspecting where they'll ultimately find the real answers ? within themselves . " The leading players are good-looking , but they neither look nor act like they are in high school . Nothing against the actors hired , but there are adult performers who could pass for high school age students . A couple of changes would have given the cast a more believable appearance . What makes it worse is that the idea was a good one , but , really ? this cast doesn't look like they are teens stressing-out over getting " The Perfect Score " on their SATs . Instead , they look like they should be having sex and getting sliced up by " Freddy " or " Jason " . The lighting and photography ( Clark Mathis ) are nice .

I guess this is a case where less is not more . ( So , a scene with Colman resisting Loy's advances , and she respecting him for it , was cut ? ) The acting is a collision of three types : Stage , Silent , and Talking . Some of the camera work was nice . . . most everything else was way below what you'd expect from even an early talking movie . The doctors in these early films sure drink and smoke a lot . . . The moral of the story , I guess is that women should not smoke - witness what happens to poor Ms . Hayes ! Arrowsmith ( 1931 ) John Ford - Ronald Colman , Helen Hayes , Myrna Loy

Wells ( later more commonly known as Julie Bishop ) is assisted by her trusty sidekick Si " Purdy " Jenks ( as Purdy ) . Though Rogers is said to be smitten with the Lady Bishop , few sparks fly between them . The more entertaining twosome are the sidekicks - Gabby and Purdy , who get to share a bed ! - but , relax , Gabby is just in Purdy's bed to hide-out . The old codgers might have could have elevated the film , if their material was better . Gabby does get to call Bishop a " She-male " ; later , she shoots two men , then bows demurely when Rogers gets one . " The Ranger and the Lady " doesn't meet expectations .

Stanley Holloway and Mona Washbourne ( as Mr . and Mrs . Brown ) lift the film's acting levels only slightly , unfortunately ; they have a very fetching teen model daughter Judy ( Sarah Caldwell ) , who catches Mr . N-o-o-n-e's eye . The other " Mrs . Brown " is his greyhound dog . By far , the best part of the film is Herman's " There's a Kind of Hush ( All Over the World ) " night dream ; it's a great song , and was a huge international hit for the group in early 1967 . Title song " Mrs . Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter " is also a winner ; however , it is not given a full performance in this film - - and , it's an even older track . Strong new material from the group ( and session players Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones ) might have helped this film . The " My Old Man's A Dustman " scene / song is amusing , but why wasn't a Hermits-sung performance if this song used ? That might have provided the group with a film supporting novelty hit ; at least in the USA , which the Hermits seemed more able to do than Most . . . it is spelled N-o-o-n-e , but the correct spelling doesn't work

The film begins with an accidental ( convenient ? ) kidnapping , which leads to one thing , and another - which doesn't really indicate the main story , which is a " Big House , U . S . A . " prison break story . The story is very improbable , to say the least . It's like a TV show , only more " violent " ( for the times ) . BUT - the cast is a trip ! Picture this : Ralph Meeker is sent to prison ; his cell-mates are the following criminals : Broderick Crawford , Lon Chaney Jr . , Charles Bronson ( reading a " Muscle " magazine ! ) , and William Talman ( reading a " Detective " magazine ! ) . Honest ! You should know that , an early scene reveals what happens to the " missing " boy , answering the ending " voiceover .

453083	15896852	268312	3.0	Jimmy We Hardly Knew Ye	This appears to be a very ordinary documentary , written , produced and directed by Ara Chekmayan , for the video market . However , it promises to be , " A stunning NEW look at a legendary star . " What's new will depend upon what you already know . I found this account of James Dean's life interesting , and learned some things which would probably not surprise many others . Most interesting to learn of Mr . Dean's train ride with his mother's coffin , a girlfriend suddenly marrying another man ( Vic Damone ) , and the fact that there was another passenger ( Rolf the mechanic ) in the car crash which killed Dean . Julie Harris , William Bast , and some other " friends , co-stars , and teachers " ( it says here , on the box ) share their " insightful " interviews . Ms . Harris speaks sweetly about working with Dean on " East of Eden " . Mr . Bast shares a very sweet story about when his mother came to visit himself and Dean in their apartment . Kenneth Kendall talks about creating a beautiful head sculpture of Dean , which was stolen from his grave , unfortunately . There are generous clips from Dean's three feature films , but only a couple of clips which could , arguably , be called " never before seen . " Charges Dean was " homosexual " are vociferously denied . Chris Busone does a very ' 80s sounding tribute song called " American Rebel " . " Forever James Dean " is far more insightful about marketing than it is about Dean . Forever James Dean ( 1988 ) Ara Chekmayan - James Dean , Julie Harris , William Bast

Clearly , Mr . Meeker and Mr . Roche have some " generation gap " difficulties ; but , they pale in comparison with the love lost between the two men and Ms . Lupino . Lupino could care less about her delinquent son ; instead , she enjoys tutoring pretty young Kerry Lynn ( as Priscilla ) . Little do the adults know , but the " kids " are plotting ? This sometimes confusing , and seldom plausible , " misunderstood kids drama " has a few interesting attributes . Old pro Lloyd Nolan tries to sort out the plot ; he contributes greatly to an interesting cast . Prrforming admirably , Mr . Nolan makes everyone sharing his screen time look better . David Doyle , waiting for " Charlie's Angels " to resume , has quite a " My Boys Are Good Boys " backstory to tell . Notably , Lupino's shrewish characterization was her last film appearance , before retiring .

Watching their drinking and smoking habits , it's a wonder they didn't burn down the house , or fall down the stairs , earlier . Mr . Wayne is way too old for these shenanigans ; all of the slapstick carousing could not have been good for his health . Favorite early film moment : check out the way Wayne attacks Ms . O'Hara's face in the " love scene " before the accident ! Intermission : John Wayne and Dan Daily sing , " I'm Gonna Move That Toe " . The movie becomes more dramatic . To show his advancing years , Wayne plays without his toupee ; surprisingly , he looks more natural , and vulnerable , than he ever will again . Not so for O'Hara ; who looks like Maureen O'Hara with an ugly streak of silver paint in her hair . Check out the scene with Wayne saying , " ? it's too late " ; then , O'Hara kisses his balding head - a symbolic way of saying , " John Wayne , you are older than your years , take it easy , we love you . " It's a very nicely photographed scene , and the highlight of the movie . That's what the film has to offer - nice moments . Finally , the movie becomes a war story . There are a lot of bombs , and airplanes crash . The John Wayne / John Ford " formula " production shows signs of crashing with " The Wings of Eagles " .

In the softest focus , Ava Gardner appears to be having some fun . If only Lionel Stander did an impression of Hervé Villechaize exclaiming , " The plague , the plague ! " they'd have had a potential comedy , instead of a disaster . The Cassandra Crossing ( / 76 ) George P . Cosmatos - Sophia Loren , Richard Harris , Martin Sheen
453384	15896852	45094	3.0	Road to Silly	I thought Mr . Crosby had a great voice . He should have had more singing time in the film . Mr . Hope seemed a bit hapless - perhaps he and Crosby were not ready for the film . They seemed very unrehearsed , especially during the " song and dance " bit . The movie is very dated . My grandmother says this " comedy " wasn't even funny , to her , back then . I believe these " native / road " movies sent a coded message that there would be a lot of " skin " time shown . . . well , this doesn't work , today . The players don't show all that much skin ; perhaps , at that time , it was enough ? The " clever " jokes ( Sadie Thompson was the hooker in " Rain " ) seem not to move the characters along . Many of the scenes look disjointed , and cheap . The ending is a mild pick-up . Despite the obvious " come ons " , the film is sexless .

452578	15896852	76451	3.0	A Star Is Boring , A Star Is Boring	When World War II ends , singer Liza Minnelli ( as Francine Evans ) meets saxophonist Robert De Niro ( as Jimmy Doyle ) during celebrations . Although neither seems at all attracted to the other , he tries to pick her up . After repeated attempts and refusals , the ill-matched duo decide they can make beautiful music together . They make out in a cab , and eventually tie the knot . Then , wouldn't you know , their careers follow the predictable " A Star Is Born " path . How could a well-budgeted Martin Scorsese direct Ms . Minnelli , and Mr . De Niro in a film so dull ? " New York , New York " is an astonishing misuse of resources . A lot of the dialogue seems improvised , as has been noted by some of the principals . Mr . Scorsese certainly gives the undeserving story a stylish look , however . And , the music is terrific ; especially Minnelli's standout performance of " New York , New York " - - if you can stand the wait .
453111	15896852	41238	3.0	Those Doggone Scottish Laws	Back ( again ) in Scotland , Lassie is ( again ) on trial for her life . Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master's grave , she must be put to death , according to law . Oddly , it is also explained that Lassie had no " legal " owner , which is , apparently , also against an old Scottish law . If , after three days , no owner is located , dogs must be destroyed . Edmund Gwenn ( as John Traill ) pleads Lassie's case , which leads to an extended flashback , showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp ( as John " Jock " Gray ) . Although it's based on an interesting , original story ( " Greyfriars Bobby " ) , " Challenge to Lassie " revisits several earlier Lassie situations ; and , it does not improve upon them . Comparatively speaking , this one is sloppy and unexciting ; and , it's a disappointing follow-up to " The Sun Comes Up " ( 1949 ) . Geraldine Brooks ( as Susan Brown ) and several of the other performers may be charming , but can't elevate this one . Little Jimmy Hawkins ( from " It's a Wonderful life " ) is among the notable children supporting Lassie ; much later , he will grow up to marry " Dark Shadows " ' bewitching " Angelique " ( Lara Parker ) .

Mr . Rogers gets a job singing on Ms . Evans ' show boat " Yellow Rose of Texas " . Later , Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " are hired , too . Evans doesn't think her dear father Harry Shannon is guilty . Do you ? Mr . Nolan and the Sons are in fine voice , with the first rendition of " Timber ! " an obvious highlight . The plot really doesn't make much sense , by Rogers seems to figure it out ( so you won't have to ) ; it is resolved with the opening of a box on the " Show Boat " . Watch as a fake horse almost knocks Dale Evans over when she enters to sing the final version of the title song !

This is a film for Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor ( he takes off his shirt as a bonus ) fans only . Otherwise , " His Brother's Wife " is an absurd movie . The opening switches around from an infested Jungle Fever ? to Mr . Taylor as a seemingly alcoholic doctor ? to Ms . Stanwyck playing Roulette ? Then , Stanwyck and Taylor go on a prolonged date where she discovers he has a fetish for collecting and / or trading hats , which seems to disappear with his alcoholic tendencies - actually , he's an excellent doctor .

452472	15896852	104670	3.0	A Comedy without Respect	Bucking for a promotion at work , Rodney Dangerfield ( as Chester Lee ) brags about his soccer prowess ; so , his boss assigns him coach for " The Ladybugs " , an inept girls soccer team . Mr . Dangerfield knows little about soccer , and less about coaching the team ; so , he persuades girlfriend's sporting son Jonathan Brandis ( as Matthew ) to join the team , in drag . Donning a wig to become " Martha " , Mr . Brandis becomes the team's star " girl " player . How long can this deception last ? Promotion as " A Comedy with Balls " gives away the film's big wit ; of course , there are several jokes about testicles . Dangerfield and assistant Jackée Harry ( as Julie Benson ) can be much funnier than they are in this movie . The problem , perhaps , is that Dangerfield is " toned down " to appeal to a younger audience . Otherwise , it's difficult to believe the situation herein . Brandis has a non-gender specific appeal ; he is best in a scene entertaining a " fellow " pretty soccer player , Vinessa Shaw ( as Kimberly ) . Watch Brandis change between " Matthew " and " Martha " very quickly , with a cool stairway trick . There are some ( admittedly straw-grasping , here ) admirable messages for younger girls : for example , self-conscious " Penny Pester " is made to feel pretty ; and , the team is given some " you can do it " ( despite being girls ) confidence . However , it's difficult to believe a high school teenager would join a girls soccer team to either get close to a girl , or please a prospective step-father . And , a character's reaction to the farce is incomprehensible ( " ? corrupt my son ! " , " Go to your room ! " ) . Worse yet is a " changing room " scene with commits a comedy sin ; it's offensive without being funny . Ladybugs ( 1992 ) Sidney J . Furie - Rodney Dangerfield , Jonathan Brandis , Jackée Harry

Hay-brained Mr . Hawk decides to go riding with girlfriend Nan Green ( as Dotty ) while the others join Paul Pepper ( as Skip ) and Brianne Murphy ( as Pam ) for water sports . The four boaters wind up stranded on a mysterious island . There , the waterskiing couples lose their boat , and are held captive by glamour-gowned doctor Katherine Victor ( as Myra ) - she wants to turn the teenagers into zombies ! Jerry Warren's " Teenage Zombies " is a very poorly produced , sometimes fun film . The storyline is silly , but easy to understand . Communists want to turn the United States into a bunch of zombies . They might have considered letting nature take its course ( but , then , there wouldn't be a movie ) . An ensemble cast , led by Sullivan , plays the material very well , considering the script's obvious idiocy . Hawk does a surprisingly good job as " Morrie " . And , Ms . Victor is a hilariously hospitable hostess , offering soda pop to her potential zombies . Teenage Zombies ( 1959 ) Jerry Warren - Don Sullivan , Katherine Victor , Jay Hawk

Sylvia Sidney ( as Iris Hilliard ) , is a mysterious part-Chinese woman , who provides Mr . Cagney with intrigue and romance . While Ms . Sydney is somewhat successful in her portrayal , the other Japanese impersonations are embarrassing . The movie bases much of its storyline on the existence of the " Tanaka Document " , a Hitler-type blueprint for evil , which was more likely a propagandist's creation . Under these circumstances , Cagney and company's attempt to produce convincing entertainment collapses .

The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This said-to-be follow-up to " The Thirteenth Guest " has little to do with the earlier movie ; it is not a sequel , as has been inferred . Ms . Rogers continues to develop her skills . Mr . Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization . They are a pleasant team , the plot is interesting and mysterious ; but , the resulting film is very dull .

Will lady Bill find love ? And , who is " Killer Pete ? " The film's highlight is a fight , near the end , between Ms . Singleton and Ms . Miller . Note the differing pronunciations of the word " posse " - AND , in a first-class wardrobe malfunction , Singleton accidentally rips open Miller's blouse . Other than that , the film may entertain friends and relatives of those who worked in the production . There are also some country & western musical acts , which could be a treat , if you're a fan .

Lynn's scheme is to infiltrate the gang as an incompetent stooge on the government's payroll , unmask the leader's identity , and then make his deadly move , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Mr . Litel gets to play the leading man , but in a low-budget , under-rehearsed quickie . Perky reporter Florence Rice ( as Linda Gregory ) , in her penultimate screen appearance , is Litel's main female interest . Ms . Rice wears very TALL headgear . " The Boss of Big Town " offers some good-looking 1940s female fashion , with a California pool scene , and Jean Brooks ( as Iris Moore ) . There is also an opportunity to see Howard Hughes protégée David Bacon ( as Dr . Gil Page ) . In real life , Mr . Bacon would soon be found stabbed to death , in an odd , unsolved Hollywood murder . Silent film veterans H . B .

Notable as a very early effort from writer / director Francis Ford Coppola , who went on to much greater success in the 1970s . Producer Roger Corman should be commended as he , once again , provides work for an up-and-coming Hollywood player . Mr .

Rogers's ex-pal , Sheriff Gabby . Gale Storm ( Jane Fillmore ) and Sally Payne ( Polly Morgan ) are a noteworthy team , as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero . Of course , mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development , since Rogers essays a " dual role " . Rogers is charming , as usual ; but , there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done in by poor material . The better pair to watch are Ms . Storm and Ms . Paye as the St . Louis Journal reporters - they are the film's highlight . The songs are fine , though badly synched .

Coburn uses his newspaper column " On the Firing Line " to rally the townspeople - he wants to save an old town Courthouse from being torn down , and replaced . Can he rally the townspeople to save the monument from demolition ? Although the Courthouse in danger is a Confederate Courthouse , there is no political agenda offered by the film - it's simply a story about weeding out political corruption , and preserving an old building . There is , however , a stereotypical servant ( called " Orderly 98 " ) who isn't too hard to take until his offensive fencing scene with Coburn . The " whistle " which accompanies close-ups of Ms . Bennett's legs is ridiculous . Don't expect authentic Georgia accents . A nice idea , and a competent cast , aren't enough to lift this " Colonel Effingham's Raid " .

Inslee in an old tenement building , living with his wife Marion Leonard , and their baby . Inslee explains he is as penniless as down-and-out Gebhardt , and has no money . The two men argue , and Gebhardt angrily marks the door to Inslee's apartment with a vengeful " X " as he leaves . Later , Gebhardt returns to rig a horrific plan ; he'll have Ms . Leonard unwittingly kill their baby by hanging the bound baby in a basket from the apartment window ; when mother opens the window , baby falls to a certain death ! Biograph's New York studio , and area location are helpful in story setting ; in the set-up scenes , the extras are pleasing to watch - - they include Biograph girls Linda Arvidson , Florence Lawrence , and Dorothy West . Director D . W . Griffith's story goes for the sure-fire suspense by putting an innocent baby's life in danger . There are some notable storytelling flaws - - for instance , note that the baby is conveniently pre-bound , and Ms . Leonard's table cloth is certainly not her favorite ! Still , there are some nice touches ; like Gebhardt's marking , and later wiping of the " X " on his enemy's door . " The Cord of Life " is the string which holds the basketed baby from the apartment window ; the string is held in place by the closed window ; when the window is opened , the string should loosen , and drop the baby , according to villainous Gebhardt's plan . For fun , try to figure out how father Inslee plans to solve the problem , and save the baby .

The local sheriff is faced with an angry community leader demanding an end to the matter , or his resignation . Through the combined efforts of the sheriff and a quick witted mechanic , the source of the problem is discovered , a fifty-foot Gila monster who has run out of food , and is now preying upon the local populace , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . God's unexplored wilderness ( aka Texas ) , as shown in the film's beginning , includes no sign of food ; so , it's only natural to have its " Giant Gila Monster " leave . It starts off by eating two tasty teenagers , who are trying to enjoy some " submarine races " . The director , Ray Kellogg , seems to have a thing for actors putting their legs up somewhere . Watch for both hero Don Sullivan ( as Chase ) and Sheriff Fred Graham ( as Jeff ) to put their legs up together , in the auto-mechanic shop ( Compton's Garage ) . The characterizations are interesting . Sullivan is an older " influence " on the younger and more rebellious " gang " of teenagers ; and , he has turned from hot-rodder to auto-mechanic . He is supporting his mother and crippled little sister . Sullivan also sings well ; although , his choice of material definitely does NOT rock . Not as much is revealed about Mr . Graham's character ; but , he is refreshingly non-confrontational with the younger cast members . The movie is at least two legs up over awful , and is fun to watch with friends .

Each man wants to pass on , through the child , their surname . Mr . Farnum steals away with the tot , who grows several decades , into adult Bill Boyd ( as Bill Holbrook ) . Mr . MacDonald may have lost the boy , but he gained a girl , pretty blonde Helen Twelvetrees ( as Mary Ellen Cameron ) . Ms . Twelvetrees attracts Montana cowboy Clark Gable ( as Rance Brett ) , who helps at the ranch . When Twelvetrees gets a hankerin ' for Mr . Boyd , the spurned Mr . Gable gets jealous . Often described as Gable's first " talkie " , this film might more accurately be described as his first role of consequence . Note , Gable had about as much to say in " Du Barry , Woman of Passion " as in most of his silent films . Farnum , a huge star in the mid-teens , was in the talking " Du Barry " , also . Considering the successful careers had by Farnum , Boyd and Gable , this film is quite disappointing . The dialogue comes out of everyone's mouth like molasses . A little fun to see the stars somewhat dimmer than usual .

At the beach , Inslee abducts Ms . Arvidson , taking her off in a canoe ( presumably to aid in his escape ) . Will the swimsuit set be able to rescue fair damsel from the clutches of the maniacal Inslee ? D . W . Griffith presents an interesting situation : having a insane criminal " invade " a group of innocent young beachgoers , who are presumably unrelated to the lunatic . Note that , along the way , Inslee accosts a man , serving no other purpose than to exchange the lunatic's gun for a knife . Those looking for Director Griffith to start every genre imaginably might call " Where Breakers Roar " the proto-type " slasher film " ; however , there is no slashing . Mainly , this film is an opportunity to see 1908 swimsuit fashions . Where Breakers Roar ( 1908 ) D . W . Griffith - Arthur V . Johnson , Linda Arvidson , Charles Inslee

This time George " Gabby " Hayes brings along his niece , none other than Calamity Jane ( well played by Sally Payne ) to assist Mr . Rogers . It's an interesting team-up concept , however unlikely . The film's highlight is its posse / stagecoach chase scene , near the film's end . Rogers and Yakima Canutt - - I assume the stuntman is the stunning Mr . Canutt - - perform well in an exciting man-under-the-stage sequence . That sequence followed one of the typical Rogers songs . Otherwise , this is nothing more than a fair Rogers western .

The waste of cast and crew involved in this boring film is criminal . The musical highlight is the Leiber / Stoller classic " Little Egypt " ; although Presley lip-syncs lethargically , dancing girl Wilda Taylor is a sight for sore eyes . Presley , who hides a growing paunch and occasionally appears " under the influence , " looks better during the nicely photographed " Big Love , Big Heartache " .

The quartet are : supercilious school-hating Trevor Fehrman ( as Handsome Davis ) , his likewise good-looking pal Matthew Lawrence ( as Victor ) , their chubby school-hating chum Elden Henson ( as Sammy ) , and crooked geekster Martin Starr ( as Applebee ) . The adults include high-strung North Point principal Mary Tyler Moore ( as Mrs . Stark ) and pornography-loving father Griffin Dunne ( as Mr . Davis ) . The high jinks begin with Mr . Fehrman and Mr . Lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher's grade book . Put this one at the bottom of the pile ; and , be thankful it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record .

Meanwhile , father David Miles receives a message ( from young Robert Harron ) which necessitates daddy leaving home ; so , when the young women return , they can be ? home alone . As the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening , the local " Grand Ball of the Black and Tans " gets underway ; and , a dark-skinned drinker portends additional danger for D . W . Griffith's dynamic duo ? Mr . Inslee has one of his better Biograph roles , stealing the film from " The Girls and Daddy " . Ironically , Director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras at the " Black and Tans " ball . " Biograph Girls " Lawrence and West are suggestive of later " Griffith Girls " Lillian and Dorothy Gish , especially in " Orphans of the Storm " ( 1921 ) ; and , they are excessively affectionate in bed ! The racist tone is unfortunate , since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger , is intriguing . The Girls and Daddy ( 1909 ) D . W .

Lawrence's biscuits aren't as charming as she ; when Lawrence leaves the room , Mr . Cumpson tosses the biscuits out the window , pretending they were delicious , and leaves for work . Proud of her successful baking endeavor , Lawrence packs up her remaining biscuits , to bring to Cumpson's workplace , a " Theatrical Booking Office " . " Biograph Girl " Lawrence shines . There is mild fun in watching a slew of 1909 D . W . Griffith players acting " theatrical " after partaking of Lawrence's distasteful biscuits ! Not surprisingly , Mack Sennett is a stand-out among the bunch - - however , for the most part , the promising comedy bits / situations are far too underdeveloped to make this film a comic classic .
452633	15896852	895	3.0	For Wardrobe Watchers	While the American Revolution rages , Owen Moore , " a brave American officer trying to get news of a British attack to General Washington , " leaves home on his mission . He is immediately attacked by German Hessians , working for the British crown . Mr . Moore manages to make it back home , where father James Kirkwood is able to conceal him from the imminent intruders . " The Hessian Renegades " terrify Moore's family , as they try to keep the young soldier hidden . Soon , murder and sexual harassment rock the soldier's family . . . Mary Pickford takes a turn to stand out , among the usual Biograph regulars , by dressing up as a soldier ; not surprisingly , she is a very unconvincing young man ! It's fun to spot director D . W . Griffith's other regulars . This story , aka " 1776 or the Hessian Renegades " isn't one of the director's better early offerings - - however , there are a few highlights . Watch for Mr . Kirkwood to suffer a split pants " wardrobe malfunction " in the last few seconds !

Flat broke , Richard Arlen ( as Johnny Maverick ) drives west , picking up , and partnering up , with prospecting hitch-hiker Elisha Cook Jr . ( as " Chicopee " ) . Almost immediately , the two discover oil , on land owned by the country bumpkin " Smithers " family . Mr . Arlen writes John and Martha Smithers a check , to buy their oil-rich land , then schemes to cover its cost . But , old enemy Buster Crabbe ( as Mike Rawlins ) isn't about to let Arlen strike it rich without a fight . Additional arrivals provide further intrigue ( William Frawley ) and love interest ( Arline Judge ) . While " Wildcat " Arlen and many of the supporting cast are pleasant , this is an mostly dull story . An exciting scene occurs early on , which prematurely kills off the film's most endearing , up to that point , character . The tragedy is necessary for subsequent plot developments , which are anticlimactic .
452720	15896852	35567	3.0	Spencer Tracy Takes Katharine Hepburn in a Bizarre Act of Unnatural Love	Popular political columnist Katharine Hepburn ( as Tess Harding ) guest-stars on a radio program ; and , after muffing a question about " America's National Pastime " ( baseball ) , declares the sport should be abolished . Of course , this irks her " New York Chronicle " colleague , sports columnist Spencer Tracy ( as Sam Craig ) . The two writers begin inking out " World War III " in their respective columns . When Mr . Tracy finally meets Ms . Hepburn's legs , in person ( it's a spacious office building ) , it's love at first sight . But , can Tracy domesticate a feminist-leaning Hepburn ? In their first feature film team-up , Tracy and Hepburn get off to a surprisingly rocky start - the main problem with " Woman of the Year " is its insulting , offensive script , credited to Ring Lardner and Michael Kanin . These writers , along with producer Joseph L . Mankiewicz and director George Stevens , would certainly suggest a better product than what appears on the screen . How is it that Hepburn , a worldly enough woman , knows zilch about baseball ? A early scene , with Hepburn at a Yankees game , would have worked if she , in an aside , revealed she was putting Tracy on - otherwise , the scene belongs to someone like Betty Grable ( or Judy Holliday ) . It is strange to see Hepburn almost get her neck caught in a window cord , and Tracy having trouble closing a refrigerator door - suggesting re-takes may not have been a priority . The very weak ending has Hepburn as a watered-down " Lucy Ricardo " , trying to make breakfast for her man . Tracy , who was somewhat likable ( relatively speaking ) through most of the film , ends with a bizarre violent act . Obviously , the characters played by Hepburn and Tracy should not be married . . . Thankfully , the Tracy Hepburn films got better ?

One man , a lawyer , resists her advances - so , naturally , she wants him most of all . He spanks her for her naughty ways , and it changes her life ( she tells him he really makes an " impression " ) . She gets herself a job as lawyer Paul Page's secretary and does tough things like clean his inkwell . Myrna Loy is good as a supporting player who wants to set her brother up with wealthy Ms . White . White is an engaging and funny performer , but her character behavior at the end of the film is so dumb it spoils the film . It shows the character has no maturity . If I were Mr . Page , I would shine her on - or , give her another spanking . The Naughty Flirt ( 1931 ) Edward F . Cline - Alice White , Paul Page , Myrna Loy

Stripping down to his gym shorts for a run , Mr . Page catches the eye of blonder super-hunk Bradley Stryker ( as Devon Eisley ) . Mr . Stryker is the leader of Drake's weirdest fraternity ; and , he travels around with good-looking men in sunglasses . Stryker decides he wants Page's perfect body . Page tells super-geek ( but cute ) roommate Josh Hammond ( as Dan Myers ) he isn't interested in joining a fraternity . Then , Page admires Stryker's big fraternity pin , and gets sucked in ? Director David DeCoteau is definitely going after something . Page and Stryker make an interesting couple , especially when they play a " three way " love scene ; note , the female ( " Sandy " ) is incidental . " The Brotherhood " may have worked better if Mr . DeCoteau had either gone all out , or made the " gay subtext " more subtle . The subtle route is often taken by other filmmakers . The " vampire " storyline is more than a little hard to swallow ( if the guys in question are supposed to be vampires ) .

When the pearls are discovered missing , Mr . Ford uses Ms . Vaughn as an unwitting accomplice ; he stashes the necklace in her belongings , to retrieve at a later date . But , Vaughn is engaged to Tyrell Davis ( as Ronnie Courtney ) , who becomes jealous of Ford . When Ford goes to retrieve the stolen pearls from Vaughn , comic complications ensue . Most notable as silent star Harrison Ford's last film appearance . In his only speaking role , Ford's voice is serviceable ; but , he seems uncomfortable with the talking picture . Vaughn and Davis are more natural . No matter , director Frank Strayer's " Love in High Gear " never really takes off , in any case .

With nothing else to eat , the giant shrews set their sights on the compound of scientists and their guests . Led by Captain Thorne Sherman , the group must make a break for his ship to escape from the ravenous shrews , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Taking refuge from an approaching hurricane , handsome skipper James Best ( as Thorne Sherman ) surely regrets sharing an island with GIANT , multiplying KILLER SHREWS ; but , Swedish blonde Ingrid Goude ( as Ann Craigis ) makes the scenery beautiful , at least . Ken Curtis ( as Jerry Farrell ) doesn't like losing the chance to knock boots with pretty Ms . Goude ; and he doesn't agree with the others ' shrew-survival plans , either . This is a surprisingly well-paced low budget horror . The claustrophobic barricading scenes are reminiscent , in hindsight ( obviously ) , of superior films , like Alfred Hitchcock's " The Birds " and George Romero's " Night of the Living Dead " ; and , parts also seem like Ron Underwood's terrific " Tremors " . If you don't pay too much attention , the story progression is logical enough . If a genre for " awful low budget 1950s horror ' were considered , " The Killer Shrews " might be one of the best . Unfortunately , " The Killer Shrews " is rather despicably , and transparently , racist . It was produced by Ken Curtis and Gordon McLendon , who also co-starred . It's difficult to believe neither they nor writer Jay Simms , nor director Ray Kellogg weren't aware how their " fat Negro " and " fat Hispanic " characters were being depicted . Someone ? ANYONE ? It's also sexist , of course ; but , beautiful women fare better . The film is entertaining in ways perhaps unintended ; and , it is interesting in comparison with films like " Night of the Living Dead " .

Buddy Hackett ( as S . Z . Matts ) wants " Muscle Man " Peter Lupus ( using the name Rock Stevens ) for his wealthy client Luciana Paluzzi ( as Judy ) , but she gets a hankerin ' for Frankie . . . The soundtrack songs are a highlight , appropriately sounding like Brian Wilson's Beach Boys ; moreover , Frankie and Annette are joined by Dick Dale and Stevie Wonder . Morey Amsterdam should have been retained as a series regular . The Eric Von Zipper motorcycle gang is missing . The regular players are still fresh , but the elements are not up to par , relatively speaking . It's a fair " Beach Party " film ; obviously , it's not as good as the first .

After Chad and Joe lose the payroll to French soldiers , Reese joins them in fighting for its recovery . His fellow Rangers dupe Reese into believing that , following the mission , he is to receive the " Governor's Gold Medal " , for bravery . . .

Meanwhile , back in Laredo , gullible Neville Brand ( as Reese Bennett ) is tricked into entering a bullfight , by handsome Texas rangers Peter Brown ( as Chad Cooper ) and William Smith ( as Joe Riley ) , who take bets on the victor . After some silliness , ranger boss Philip Carey ( as Capt . Parmalee ) sends the trio undercover , as gold prospectors , to catch the Indian " Lazyfoot " , and his tribe . Mr . Carey surmises the Indians will be easy to catch , as they will be drunk on their stolen booty . In Presidio , the trio meet old prospector Burgess Meredith ( as Grubby ) , and hip-swinging saloon proprietor Beverly Garland ( as Aggie ) . Excited about a claim , Mr . Meredith invites the undercover lawmen to partner up . Chad and Joe want to go along , for the money , but Reese vetoes the idea . To get rid of Reese ( temporarily ) , Chad and Joe pretend he is the wanted sheep rustler " Jack Kendall " . After Reese is jailed , Chad and Joe head out prospecting . Instead of gold , they find " Lazyfoot " and his boozing Indians to be more surefooted than expected . The lighthearted camaraderie between stars Neville Brand , Peter Brown , and William Smith is what really sustains the episode and , more or less , the series . For the climax , Brown and Smith are stripped of their shirts , and tied to the ground ; obviously , this is done to show off their admirable physiques . Unfortunately , Native Americans are not only stereotypical in manner , but also laughable in appearance . " Laredo " was piloted in an earlier edition of " The Virginian " .

The quartet are sent out to round up illegal still-operator Dub Taylor ( as Dude Meeker ) . They try to give Mr . Taylor some time to escape , because Laredo has a new judge in town . Judge John Hoyt ( as " Limit of the Law Larkin " ) is a prohibitionist who hands out the toughest sentences possible . Later , the judge has Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) send Chad , Joe , and Mr . Akins on a dangerous mission transporting a box of legal documents to nearby Uvalde . This is the first of several episodes featuring semi-regular Claude Akins . Like George Kennedy in a previous episode , his character seems like a " replacement " for Neville Brand . Mr . Akins does quite well in his part-time Ranger role . Mr . Brand , who does appear , seems unwell , probably due to alcohol consumption . Ironically , this is most apparent when the prohibitionist Judge tells the " Laredo " group he doesn't feel Brand is competent enough to go on the episode's mission ; and , " Reese " is left to mind the office . Brand is better in an earlier courtroom scene . Joan Marshall ( as Ivy Vine ) is an attractive distraction .

Meanwhile , Reese has confronted older Mexican John Marley ( as Alvar de Aveles ) , who has offended townspeople by flying his country's flag . Taking Reese hostage , Mr . Farentino's gang heads for the border , with Chad and Joe in hot pursuit ? This episode features a very tedious location footage trek ; probably , it was meant to please viewers watching " ? IN LIVING COLOR , on NBC ! " Farentino ( not a Mexican in real life ) does very well as the villainous " Paco " . Marley's supporting character , a proud and " sympathetic " Mexican , comes across well , also . Look for James Doohan ( as Mike Pripton ) in a pre - " Star Trek " bit part . Unfortunately , the interesting cast can't raise the story above ordinary . Laredo - I See by Your Outfit ( / 65 ) Harvey Hart - Neville Brand , Peter Brown , James Farentino

He's a old time horror movie star on the comeback trail ; his attempt is , however , being thwarted by a series of horrific murders . Naturally , Mr . Price ( aka " Dr . Death " ) is a prime suspect . Along for the movie ride are Peter Cushing ( as writer Herbert Flay ) and Robert Quarry ( as producer Oliver Quayle ) . Another interesting , but failed , follow-up to Price's successful " The Abominable Dr . Phibes " ( 1971 ) . The promising team-up of horror maestros Vincent Price and Peter Cushing , with Robert Quarry , in a " Madhouse " is decidedly anti-climatic - in fact , the stars are not at all well-served . The film is cheap ; and , the story inferior and predictable . Some of the scenes are laughable instead of horrifying - the bed crushing apparatus looks very tacky when it comes down the second time , for example . Don't expect much from this " Madhouse " .

Mr . Swickard wants his grand-daughter to marry another Spaniard , preferably a rich one . Then , cruel and crafty Warner Oland ( as Chris Buckwell ) and his Chinese " Mongol " gang threaten Dolores ' life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness . A relatively well-produced Darryl F . Zanuck silent . The time and place of " Old San Francisco " gives away the ending ; of course , it's the great 1906 earthquake . Photographer Hal Mohr and director Alan Crosland collaborate for some nice images ; for example , the shadowy Oland / Mack fight , and Chinatown's underground labyrinth . Supporting player Anna May Wong barely appears ; but , Angelo Rossita is cute as a caged dwarf related to the villainous Mr . Oland . Unfortunately , the story wavers between ludicrous and despicable . If it weren't all so silly , it might have been even more offensive .

This is the obligatory " outlaw with a cute kid " episode ( and , it was Easter time , after all ) . Unfortunately , it is a noticeably sloppy production . Kids do help with characterization , and the Rangers react accordingly . The script experiments with an out of the blue " point-of-view " flashback , with Capt .

The comedy highlight should have been Reese baking the captain's cake , with Joe assisting ; but , it falls flat . Guest starring villain Lee Van Cleef served a similar role in the classic " High Noon " . This episode falls at least forty-five minutes short of the original . It isn't much , but Mr .

Chad's misjudgment of the woman's character is surprising , since he seems to have known her well , previously . Still , she was lovely , and came with the hefty promise of $400 . 00 per month .

" asks the DVD sleeve's synopsis . James Dearden's " The Cold Room " opens with the telling definition : " Possession : psychological state in which an individual personality is replaced by another . " In this case , possession can also be mind-numbingly dull . When she throws up her milk , you'll know ill-tempered Amanda Pays ( as Carla Martin ) is becoming Nazi-era rape victim " Christa Bruckner " . Her father , George Segal ( as Hugh Martin ) , wants to bridge the generation gap , as Ms . Pays goes mad . Pretty , model-like Pays has some serious father problems . Anthony Higgins ( as Erich ) has a good supporting role . The Cold Room ( 1984 ) James Dearden - Amanda Pays , George Segal , Anthony Higgins

A more likely suspect may be John Carradine ( as Professor Paracelsus Smythe ) , who arrives with his " Traveling Museum of Horrors " . Soon , suspicions fall mainly in Irishman Tom Simcox ( as Shamus McCloud ) , in town to meet his dead brother . But , as the bodies pile up , temple-scarred doctor DeForest Kelly ( as David Ingram ) moves up the suspect list . Could it be beautiful blonde Laraine Stephens ( as Barbara Halsey ) , or couldn't it ? The clue about each murder being accompanied by a strange sound gives the episode its title . The strange sounds , illustrated by a weird special effect , are annoying indeed . This is an unconvincing novelty episode . Soon after this appearance , Mr .

While waiting for the " land rush " to begin , Chad ( Peter Brown ) romances shapely brunette widow Audrey Dalton ( as Alice Coverly ) ; and , Reese ( Neville Brand ) entertains the homesteaders ' children , including Ms . Dalton's son Keith Jones ( as Robert Coverly ) . Joe ( William Smith ) tries to keep his pals focused on their job . Grandfatherly uniformed Alan Napier ( as Major Donaldson ) steals the show . The lucky TV antenna would soon point Mr . Napier in Batman's direction , where he would memorably run stately Wayne Manor , as Bruce's butler " Alfred " . Young Mr . Jones gives Reese a good lesson on Indians . This episode's story is misshapen on several levels , unfortunately . For example , the thugs who want to cheat during the " land rush " get around so quickly , it was unnecessary for them to break the rules . And , the charming Coverly family certainly features an odd progression of British accents . Laredo - The Land Grabbers ( / 65 ) R . G . Springsteen - Neville Brand , Peter Brown , William Smith

Their conversation is overheard ; causing several gold-diggers to threaten Reese's mission - - including : sweet talking Jeanette Nolan ( as Ma Burns ) , corrupt Sheriff ( as Wes Cottrell ) , old timer Arthur Hunnicutt , and gun-slinger Tom Reese ( as Tom Baker ) . This episode is the first to focus almost exclusively on one character ; in this case , Mr . Brand's Reese . An opening scene includes the three rangers , and some stock footage appears toward the end . Mr . Brown's " Chad " has a good scene , near the end . Understandably , the " Laredo " team spirit is subdued . Ms . Nolan's scheming turn as " Muriel Beauregard " is the strongest of a notable guest roster .

Before Maxus can battle the multi-headed monster , he must face other challenges in order to prove himself worthy and to prepare for the fateful battle , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Actually , the story mainly involves a struggle between two pre-historic tribes : the " Good " or " Sun " worshipers , and the " Bad " or " Moon " worshipers . The " Sun " tribe of Nomads has decided to settle and live in peace ; but , they pick land claimed by nearby " Moon " worshiping Cavemen .

The plot thickens when Mr . Lewis and " Moon " tribe woman Margaret Lee ( as Moah ) fall in love . In English , misleadingly reproduced as " Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules " ( ) . The English dubbing is dreadful ; in a couple of scenes , two completely different voices dub Lewis . The bleached-blond muscleman throws cavemen around , and poses . Mr . Marin essays his part better than others ; but , considering the shoddiness of the production , it's a wasted effort . The best part of the movie is the added-on TV theme song , " The ( Mighty ) Sons of Hercules " .

Amusingly , Huntz Hall ( as Horace Debussy " Sach " Jones ) defends the older Gorcey , and gets hit on his head with the robber's pistol . Strangely , the gun doesn't hurt Mr . Hall . After a trip to the doctor , the " scientific seduction " is that Hall's " square head " has developed super-human thickness , due to calcium deposits . This diagnosis doesn't make much sense , considering later events , but , anyway ? Mr . Gorcey's " Slip " sees a $1 , 000 wrestling contest as easy money , due to Hall's impervious hard-head . So , Hall is recruited into the ring . But , Hall's power has an unpredictable limitation - it travels to other body parts , without notice . Having little to say or do , David " Condon " Gorcey ( as Chuck ) and Benny " Bennie " Bartlett ( as Butch ) appear only to make " The Bowery Boys " still seem like a group . At a party , Hall tells Sandra Gould , " You better take that harmonica out of your mouth . " By then , you may have forgotten what " No Holds Barred " is about .

Charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter . In the end , he manages to get a big break , but will a star be born ? There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks .

Berry's pretty blonde daughter Phyllis Barrington ( as Bonnie McNary ) catches Farnum's eye , but she is seeing business rival Bruce Warren ( as Paul LaTour ) . Farnum , a huge silent film star beginning with " The Spoilers " ( 1914 ) , uses techniques from that medium , and stage experience ; he's interesting , at least , in this unsuccessful picture . " The Drifter " suffers from some distracting technical flaws , also . Of the supporting cast , Mr . Sellon outperforms the reliable brother of Wallace Berry . Mr . Hopton is good , also ; in one of the film's better scenes , Farnum shoots him at Church . The Drifter ( 1932 ) William O'Connor - William Farnum , Noah Berry , Phyllis Barrington

Ms . Hayworth and Mr . Ritter cross paths in Middletown Valley , where Ritter is looking for the gang that killed his brother . Undercover girl Hayworth and singing cowboy Ritter are the main attractions . Hayworth and Hank Worden have a couple of smooth dance numbers . Ritter's " Down the Colorado Trail " and " I'm Bound to Leave Ol ' Texas Now " are highlights ; the latter ballad is especially nice . The " Trouble in Texas " is , most obviously , its poorly edited " rodeo footage " . It might have , otherwise , been a better movie .

When doctor Alex is called to emergency duty at the hospital , and must cancel the hike , Donna volunteers to supervise the boys . Alex fears " a male world and a female world " won't mix , but Donna reminds him , " I was once a girl scout . " Not much happens . The writing credits ( Jay Sommers and Don Nelson ) suggest this script might have began its life as a possible " Ozzie and Harriet " adventure - but , Harriet would have likely nixed it and / or Rick and his friends were , by 1958 , too old to require adult supervision under a camping tent .

Some of the characters are interesting and recognizable , some are not ? all become tiresome , eventually . It does sound , like others have commented , that Doris Day sings one of Allyson's songs ( early-ish in the movie ) . I've been watching TCM's tribute to Allyson , and some of these films are strange indeed ! It's nice of TCM to show them , though . Allyson often wears something to match her lipstick . Ms .

When the King discovers the lovers , he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge . It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them ; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy ( the lovers ) and quiet ( the cement mixers ) . The sets make " The Sealed Room " look very staged . The performances are okay , and the story is easy to follow . The Sealed Room ( 1909 ) D . W . Griffith - Arthur V . Johnson , Henry B .

Upon release , Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil ( as Billy ) , with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter ( as Sergeant Smith ) , Jack Thompson ( as Detective Mainwaring ) , and others . Eventually , vengeance becomes heroism ; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people , and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities . Hopper's " scarcely human " performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film . Mr . Gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast . The personnel involved in " Mad Dog Morgan " make it not only worth a look , but also a huge disappointment . Mad Dog Morgan ( 1976 ) Philippe Mora - Dennis Hopper , David Gulpilil , Bill Hunter

Ms . Pickford is rather free with her flowers , however , and also has one for Mr . Miles ' dashing friend Owen Moore ( as Sandro ) ; for Mr . Moore , Pickford includes an amorous " come hither " look . The residents of Cremona are apparently violin enthusiasts ; Miles and Moore enter a contest to see which man can make the best violin in town . The prizes are a gold chain and ? Mary Pickford's hand in marriage , allowed by her father Herbert Prior ( as Taddeo Ferrari ) ! Who will the winner be ? Interesting as an early co-starring role for Pickford ; with a few exceptions , she is not as impressive in her early film roles as might be expected after viewing her later , sometimes exceptional , performances . Pickford's best moment is her repulsion when she realizes the " lame " Miles will enter the contest to win her hand in marriage , obviously because he is disabled ! Miles is the real star of this D . W . Griffith film ; given the best role , he gives the most interesting performance . A hundred years later , you can finally call " The Violin Maker of Cremona " lame .

" After Mary's date with Hamilton goes badly , she comes home in tears . So , Donna tells her about her own first date with Alex ? Then , in flashback , Donna nervously meets Alex , for an initial " New Year's Eve " date . . . The flashback sequences are not at all convincing . And , it's strange to see her patents push Mary out to a drive-in movie with a visibly weird young man " two classes ahead " of Mary ( and , he looks even older ) . Most other parents would have locked Mary in her room for the evening . If Alfred Hitchcock saw Mr .

452579	15896852	71634	3.0	Huck and Jim Sing	Unnecessary and unsatisfying musical rendering of Mark Twain's classic " Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " . At least , it captures the genuine friendship between Jeff East ( as Huckleberry Finn ) and Paul Winfield ( as Jim ) . However , these two performers are much more likable in other projects . Interestingly , Mr . East portrayed " Huck " in 1973's similarly presented re-make of " Tom Sawyer " , which was considered the better film . In my opinion , East would have been a better " Tom " than " Huck " . Some of the photography is rather nice , especially during the more moody ending . The Sherman-Sherman musical numbers are well below standard . The movie doesn't seem much like the book . Roberta Flack sings " Freedom " to end it all , at last . Huckleberry Finn ( 1974 ) J .

The unlikely group is forced to seek shelter from the attack in a nearby cave , not knowing how significant it is to the alien's plans , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Peter Maris ' " Alien Species " probably heated up a few 1990s video players , with its title and young cast . Star-billed supporting actors Charles Napier ( as Sheriff Nate Bridges ) and Hoke Howell haven't much to do ; instead , the film focuses on " young talent " . More seems to have been expected from Marc Robinson ( as Paul Towers ) and Jodi Seronick ( as Carol Nelson ) than the others ; although , Kurt Paul ( as Harlan Banks ) is more enjoyable than not . The titillation level is relatively low , you show know ; the sexiest scene is when Mr . Robinson carries Ashley Semrick ( as Stacy Chambers ) out of the cave , close to the end . ( " Somewhere , over the rainbow , way up high ? " ) Perhaps the all too quick and confusing conclusion would have been clearer in the " Coming Soon " , but canceled , follow-up " Alien Species 2 - The Invasion .

In a very dull manner . The " gal reporter " character played by Lola Lane was , in part , writer Jerry Siegel's inspiration for Superman's Girl Friend , " Lois Lane " ; however , Ms . Lane's later " Torchy Blane " characterization is a more accurate reference point . Perhaps , " Death from a Distance is most notable as featuring the penultimate performance of George F .

The film is tailor made for the White Rapper . Eminem ( as Jimmy " B Rabbit " Smith ) blows a " Rap Battle " , hangs with his Detroit ' hoodies , and nails slutty Brittany Murphy ( as Alex ) . Eminem wants to be a Big Rap Star . He lives with trailer park trashy mother Kim Basinger ( as Stephanie ) and lil ' blonde sista Chloe Greenfield ( as Lily ) . Ms . Basinger gets to say the line , " Greg won't go down on me . " Word way up . Curiously , Eminem does not sport his familiar ( at the time ) short , bleached do ; instead , he wears a knit hat over more natural brown locks . Eminem doesn't contribute any rent money , but he works hard . He is careful to avoid drugs , unlike boozy mother Basinger . Who knew Detroit's " 8 Mile " was so drug free ? The soundtrack highlights are " Lose Yourself " and a fun rap-up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's " Sweet Home Alabama " , which comes off better here than on " youtube " . Still , Eminem's pre-Hollywood studio work is much more highly recommended than this semi-autobiographical movie sanitization . 8 Mile ( 2002 ) Curtis Hanson - Eminem , Kim Basinger , Brittany Murphy

After Mr . Darrow walks Ms . Mehaffey home , he tries to collect a kiss , and more , as a reward . But , the standoffish Mehaffey smacks him . She is seeing snarling gangster Matthew Betz ( as " Snowy " Hoagland ) . Mehaffey's associations with the criminal set make her a prime suspect in the murder of the man whose testimony sent her brother to the electric chair - but , Darrow thinks Mehaffey is innocent . . . Newspaper headlines seem to proclaim the victim's death before the body of " Marco Hahn " even stiffens . Having the cat " Midnight " draw attention to the body was a purrfect touch . Mr . Betz ' gangster rap , and Raymond Hatton ( as Scoop ) ' s reporter are mildly amusing . Co-stars Mehaffey and Darrow are a boring romantic couple . Veterans like Henry B . Walthall ( as Atwell ) always manage to look good and professional , albeit in a lackluster and low-budget production . Alias Mary Smith ( 1932 ) E .

Franz ) hires pretty June Kenney ( as Sally Reynolds ) as secretary at his " Dolls Inc " , where he fashions and fixes puppetry . In short order , Ms . Kenney hooks up with salesman John Agar ( as Bob Westley ) . Then , Kenney learns Mr . Hoyt's previous secretary has mysteriously disappeared , along with a mailman ( they didn't elope ) . Soon , Mr . Agar joins the missing persons list . When an Agar doll turns up among Hoyt's creations , Kenney freaks . Could the odd " Mr . Franz " be , in reality , a mad scientist ? Could he be turning people into dolls ? Is Kenney next ? A very small budget , and likely short production time keeps " Attack of the Puppet People " from becoming something bigger . Still , the direction ( Bert I . Gordon ) and story situations keep things moving along ; a " drive-in " movie and silly theme song are pleasant diversions . The film's main asset is the lead performance of the smooth talking John Hoyt as the obviously touched , but slightly touching , " Mr . Franz " . My contribution to the movie's unanswered questions is , " What about the other doll people in the plastic tubes ? " Attack of the Puppet People ( 1958 ) Bert I .

452381	15896852	131483	3.0	Stamp Out Communism	A short documentary touting the United States issued 5-cent stamp , which could send a letter from freedom loving Americans to those outside the United States . Communist bloc countries , like Poland , are specifically noted as countries receiving millions of letters from the USA . These letters promote the American way of life " we take for granted " ; and , many " penetrate the Iron Curtain " . MGM studios figure the nickel to be worth a million dollars , due to its usefulness in spreading democracy . Pier Angeli , Ricardo Montalban , Leslie Caron , and Zsa Zsa Gabor deliver brief messages to viewers , near the film's end , in their native tongues . The three actresses are of some interest , as they are in their " starlet " years ; otherwise , " The Million Dollar Nickel " is of limited worth .

Then , into the New York apartment walks Dean Jones ( he's Cass ) , who claims to need the phone ( and a place to stay ) . When Rosemary Murphy ( John's WIFE ! ) arrives , major high-jinks ensue ! " Any Wednesday " is another dated 1960s situation sex comedy . The four are okay - with , perhaps Mr . Jones and Ms . Murphy surpassing their more well-known upper tier co-stars . The " split screen " telephoning is interesting ; and , the script is lively with sexual innuendo . These movies seem like three-times-too-long TV half-hours comedies featuring stuff they couldn't tastefully show on TV . The " Gay Joke " comic relief is an " interior decorator " whom Murphy enlists to correct Fonda's apartment decor - it is startlingly over-the-top , like a ' 60s version of the " Negro Joke " character .

Catching the two lovers together , the count tortures and kills them , using their hearts and blood to further his experiments and to restore the beauty of his own lover . After his wife's death , the count discovers that her castle and fortune are to be given to her sister instead of him . Hoping to continue his lifestyle and his experiments , the count manipulates the sister and marries her , hoping to eliminate her as he did his first wife , not knowing that the spirits of his wife and her lover are out for revenge , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Barbara Steele ( as brunette Muriel Arrowsmith and blonde Jenny Arrowsmith ) is the main attraction . Ms . Steele plays step-sisters who look extraordinarily alike . Re-titled " Nightmare Castle " for US consumption , the production seems too rushed . The movie features a jolting opening , with scenes of bondage and torture . After that , it becomes a slow , atmospheric Gothic . The filmmakers should have considered opening the film as a mysterious Gothic , and closing with " flashback " sequences - - the lurid scenes with brunette Steele and her lover - - to explain the preceding events . Then , end with the comeuppance scenes . But , what do I know ? " Hampton Castle " is a great setting . Gli amanti d'oltretomba ( 1965 ) Mario Caiano - Barbara Steele , Paul Muller , Helga Liné

When his house is repeatedly robbed , Dean Jones ( as Wilby ) receives no assistance from the local authorities ; so , he decides to run for District Attorney . Complicating his run is the reemergence of a magical ring from his teenage years - which turns him into an on again / off again shaggy dog . This movie is the first sequel to Walt Disney's " The Shaggy Dog " ( 1959 ) . Wilby Daniels , the teenager from the first film ( Tommy Kirk ) , has grown up , and has a family of his own : Suzanne Pleshette ( as wife Betty ) and Shane Sinutko ( as son Brian ) . None of the original film's leading actors appear in either flashback or cameo . " The Shaggy D . A . " attempts to explain more about the reasons for the change , raising more questions than it answers . This movie has a few funny moments , helped immensely by Tim Conway - there are a lot of other 1970s TV performers to pick out , which can be fun . But the film is a dog , compared to the original . The " special effects " from the first Shaggy progress surprisingly little , and look worse in color . The charming interacting performances of Mr . Kirk and the original's young characters is gone .

Griffith ; it's about " The Usurer " ( think " Loan Shark " and " Money Lender " ) who calls in some loans , resulting in misery for those not as well off as he . As he collects money , he indulges more and more . Like Mr . Griffith's previous " message film " he receives an ironic comeuppance . An unremarkable Griffith short ; technically , it's not up to the director's own standards . The sealed room looks like it might fall down any moment . Both the actors and sets move in the wrong ways ; and , it's painful to see poor Mary Pickford and Henry B . Walthall have their furniture repossessed ! The Usurer ( 1910 ) D . W .

452488	15896852	51393	3.0	Fair Badlanders	I thought the most interesting thing about this movie was that the miners wore those hats with torches in the front . At first , In thought they were candles , but they are really some sort of flamed headgear - looking like cloth caps with candle-type flames coming out in the front . They must have been awfully hot ! It seems , to me , many people would have been burned - hats , hair , and hide ! It must have been interesting ( and very hot ) to maneuver around mines in those things . This isn't much of a western ; you have to pinch yourself , sometimes , to remember it is presented as a western . After the mining , you get back to stagecoaches and shootouts . The soundtrack effects sometimes don't appear to be happening on screen . It's neat how Alan Ladd pulls a slug out of Ernest Borgnine . He's faster than Dr . Bombay from the " Bewitched " TV show !

The client's widow and daughter then tell the attorney an incredible tale of how the owner was able to revive the spirits of long-deceased plague victims and how his spirit roams the halls of the castle . Doubting their story , the attorney begins to reconsider when a rash of mysterious deaths occur at the castle , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Translated from Italy as " Terror-Creatures from the Grave " , this disappointing slice of horror is most notable for the inclusion of the always delectable Barbara Steele ( as Cleo Hauff ) in its cast . She takes a bath , she screams , and she always livens up a mediocre movie . And , Luciano Pigozzi ( as Kurt ) is another wasted asset . Walter Brandi ( as Albert Kovac ) and Mirella Maravidi ( as Corinne Hauff ) play the more ordinary hero and heroine . 5 tombe per un medium ( 1965 ) Massimo Pupillo - Walter Brandi , Mirella Maravidi , Barbara Steele

Krenner's men break safecracker Joey Faust out of jail and make him invisible , so that he can steal more radium , and then events take an unexpected turn , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Not only does " Invisible Man " Douglas Kennedy ( as Joey Faust ) suffer from on-again / off-again transparent powers ; but also , he is also given less than a month to live , due to radiation poisoning . Like his film cousins , Mr . Kennedy is loony . You should not expect the synopsis ' " invisible military force " to ever materialize - it sounds like fun , but it never happens . Celebrated director Edgar G . Ulmer is no more than ordinary . But , Marguerite Chapman ( as Laura Matson ) is appropriately trashy . And , Darrell Calker's score is nice .

452363	15896852	49006	3.0	Beyond a Reasonable Plot	The film begins with an interesting premise : A writer and a newspaperman are anti-Capitol Punishment . They decide to " frame " the writer ( Mr . Andrews ) for murder ; after he is tried and convicted , they plan to reveal he didn't commit the murder - saving him from the electric chair and showing how easily an innocent man can be killed with circumstantial evidence . The movie held my attention , albeit barely . For a movie requiring you to THINK ( as in , think about Capitol Punishment ) , you really can't THINK at all . The more I thought , the more I had questions - about the PLOT of this story - like WHAT do these guys think should happen to the " REAL KILLER " of this woman ? You really have to turn off you brain to fully enjoy Beyond a Reasonable Doubt , because it makes no sense if you think it through . . . I had events pretty much figured out before they happened . I thought too much , I guess . I don't think the film says much about Capitol Punishment , but the IDEA is a good one ; it would make a much better film in more adept hands .

Hoping to offer aid to the citizens of Earth , the benevolent aliens send their champion Starman to face off against the leaders of Mirapolia ( it's correctly spelled Merapolia ) and take care of their atomic weapons , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis .

This is the American ( English edited and dubbed ) version of the Japanese super-hero's earliest movies , Sûpâ jaiantsu ( 1957 ) and Zoku sûpâ jaiantsu ( 1957 ) . Herein , Mr . Utsui is Starman of " The Emerald Planet " . Considering the material , this is a sometimes surprisingly well-directed , by Teruo Ishii , piece of super-nonsense ; the location scenes are most enjoyable . Otherwise , it's , at best , unintentionally funny . Watch for the scene where Utsui goes to a church with some children , and meets a nun . She gives him a smile that shows she's attracted to him ; then , the young nun looks down at Utsui's groin area , where he has positioned his gun . Oh , sister !

This is what happened in the deserts of California . " The setting seems more 1969 than 1909 . The plot gets started when downtrodden Indian Robert Blake ( as Willie Boy ) is caught in a sexual liaison with his Indian mate , Katharine Ross ( as Lola ) , by her father . Believing he will be killed , Mr . Blake shoots Ms . Ross ' dad dead . Then , the couple go on the run , pursued by handsome Sheriff Robert Redford ( as " Coop " ) . Mr . Redford isn't as prejudiced as others in his posse , who'd prefer Blake be brought back dead . This film gets credit for renovating the careers of Jennings Lang and Abraham Polonsky ; but , it isn't , otherwise , very remarkable . Redford and Ross , riding on the success of " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " , receive relatively exaggerated billing , over Blake and Susan Clark ( as Liz Arnold ) . Robert Lipton ( as Charlie ) strums the guitar , but does not sing a theme song . The film is well-intentioned , but dull .

The recent owner of the mansion was a banker who had embezzled money and had hidden it somewhere in the mansion but , he was killed before he was able to retrieve it . Now it appears that someone is stalking the mansion ? " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This lesser re-make is most appealing in that it stars enjoyable Agnes Moorehead ( as Cornelia Van Gorder ) and features fine support from Vincent Price ( as Malcolm Wells ) and Lenita Lane ( as Lizzie Allen ) . Ms . Lane is an exceptional employee , you'll have to agree ; she also served as director Crane Wilbur's wife .

452774	15896852	39054	4.0	His Master's Voice	I found two highlights in " Two Sisters from Boston " . The first involves the dog of the big opera star ( played by Lauritz Melchior ) . It sits ever so quietly during the opera star's songs , which I thought were poorly dubbed in this movie . No matter how loud ( and gets very loud ! ) the opera star sings , the dog quietly shows no reaction . However , later on , one of the star's performances is recorded , and played . Suddenly , the dog jumps up and does a dead-on impression of the RCA Victor logo - someone comments , " His Master's Voice ! " That was very well done . Second , there is a scene where Peter Lawford revives a fainted June Allyson with gin . Smart man ! Ms . Allyson steals the film from " pretty " star Kathryn Grayson . Jimmy Durante is entertaining ; he also uses the bottle to revive Allyson . Allyson's comic performance is fresh and natural ; later comic roles seem more forced and unnatural . Unfortunately , the movie gets too far off Allyson . I really didn't care about the other characters , and they sucked up a lot of screen time . You might have to be a big opera fan ( or fan of Mr . Melchior ) to thoroughly enjoy this movie . Two Sisters from Boston ( 1946 ) Henry Koster - June Allyson , Kathryn Grayson , Jimmy Durante

Suddenly , Remington rescues rugged daytime soap star A Martinez ( as Guy Nickerson ) from what appears to staged accident . When the investigation leads to an unsolved murder , it becomes an increasingly dangerous assignment for the Remington Steele team . A stated background interest in gymnastics , and some hitherto unknown trapeze experience , helps make the story more believable .

453092	15896852	54453	4.0	Somewhere in the South Pacific	Classic example of a film that looked better on paper . " The Wackiest Ship in the Army " begins by failing as it was obviously promoted ; to be brief , it isn't very " wacky " . With the comedy ship sinking , the film becomes more dramatic ; and , much more enjoyable . Jack Lemmon ( as Rip Crandall ) , an expert at comedy-drama , tries his best . Ricky Nelson ( as Tommy Hanson ) , an expert at quip delivery , is given almost nothing to do . Promoted as a " team " , Mr . Lemmon and Mr . Nelson have no chemistry ; and , to be fair , are given no discernible direction to that end . Nelson sings one song , " Do You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans ? " Although sweet , it isn't one of his better , or representative , songs ; but , it did fit the film's World War II setting . The scene with Lemmon accompanying Nelson's singing , on piano , is interesting . Lemmon tickles the ivories , clearly uncomfortable in a " Bob Hope " role , while Nelson sings to the recording as if it were an " Ozzie and Harriet " TV bonus song . Still , the stars , supporting cast , and colorful photography ( by Charles Lawton Jr . ) are never less than pleasant .

It's a fair musical , with an " Indian " subplot ( Huh ? ) , and budget problems . You should know that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are not paired up in ( on-screen , anyway ) this film ( Ms . Ball is partnered with Mr . Carlson ) . This is a routinely presented film , with a few highlights . Unfortunately Mr . Le Roy and Ms . Miller do not have a real dance off / team-up together . Mr .

The film begins with Elvis accidentally killing the boyfriend of a woman who tries to pick him up in a bar . In jail for manslaughter , he learns to play the guitar . Out of jail , he becomes a rock ' n ' roll star . The story becomes how he deals with the fame . The movie isn't very good , although Elvis looks , and sounds , terrific - the superb " Jailhouse Rock " production number isn't just one of the highlights if this film , it's one of the best in ANY Elvis film . Judy Tyler is a sweet , atypical leading lady for Elvis . Elvis ' acting performance is uneven , at best . I found his character notably despicable ; and the storyline ridiculous and exploitive ( of Elvis ) ; but , I accept and respect contrary opinions .

Gibson lost his wife in a car accident ; and , he is struggling with a loss of Christian faith . Gibson's younger brother , Joaquin Phoenix ( as Merrill Hess ) has moved in , to help Gibson and his children grieve . Mr . Phoenix was a promising baseball player , but he stuck out too much . Gibson is an Episcopalian , obviously ( a wife and sex are permitted ) , with two children : asthmatic alien-conscious Rory Culkin ( as Morgan Hess ) and perpetually thirsty Abigail Breslin ( as Bo Hess ) . Gibson is also a farmer . The movie gets started when extraterrestrials startle Gibson's family , by turning their Pennsylvania cornfield into " Crop Signs " - aka " Crop Circles " . Soon , these " Signs " are popping up all over India , and the world . Presumably , the designs are signposts for motherships - it's difficult to understand what logical purpose they would serve , as an alien spacecraft would be too technically advanced to use them . . . maybe , then , they are merely alien pranks . Or , they could be sent from God , to help Gibson re-harvest his faith ? " Signs " borrows its basic plot from H . G . Wells ' " The War of the Worlds " - a frequently tapped well . Gibson , Phoenix , and the kids look very silly in two memorable poses , sitting stone-faced with their palms on their knees and / or wearing pointy tinfoil hats . The biggest " jolt " comes early in the film , with a simple dog's bark . Mr . Shyamalan builds suspense well , in the early scenes . The best performance is delivered by director M . Night Shyamalan ( as Ray Reddy ) . Cherry Jones ( as Caroline Paski ) is okay as the local cop , but her character should have written up ( as a possessed alien , for example ) . The main " special effect " is good ; but , the aliens , if they are real , have to be the dumbest extraterrestrials in the galaxy , if you stop and think about it ? Signs ( 2002 ) M .

One evening , he makes the " Hard Choice " and joins drug-addicted Martin Donovan ( as Josh Lipscomb ) and trigger happy John Snyder ( as Ben Lipscomb ) in a " Food Market " robbery . Unfortunately , Mr . Snyder kills a police officer , who happens upon the scene . The three brothers are quickly apprehended . Mr . McCleery hopes to be tried as a juvenile ; but , Tennessee judges rule he is to be tried as an adult . When things look bleakest for young McCleery , social worker Margaret Klenck ( as Laura Stephens ) steps in to improve his treatment in prison and the courts ; she is only partially successful . Then , Ms . Klenck makes a " Hard Choice " of her own ? According to the sleeve , this film got excellent reviews ; and , the quotes are from reliable sources . Perhaps some of these reviewers will consider re-evaluation " Hard Choices " ? It really isn't all that believable a story . McCleery doesn't seem much like a 15-year-old , and Klenck's character development is disappointing ( to say the least ) . However , they , and the other performers , do as well as they can ( with the story ) . It's great to see Mr . Donovan in an early role ; strangely , he and Snyder are abandoned during the running time . Writer-director John Sayles is good , also , as Klenck's coke companion . The photography , by Tom Hurwitz , is a major strength . Hard Choices ( 1985 ) Rick King - Gary McCleery , Margaret Klenck , John Sayles
453567	15896852	561182	4.0	Sealed with a Kiss	Last week , while on a vacation at the beach , red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy ( as Arthur and Petey Loomis ) found a seal . The lads christened their critter " Sammy " , and spent summertime frolicking with the sandy sea lion . When it was time to go home , the boys began to suffer separation anxiety . Of course , the young brothers took " Sammy " back to " Disneyland " ? er , " Gatesville " . At home , they try to hide " the Way-out Seal " from adults , but , of course ? hijacks ensue ! McGreevey and Mumy are marvelously cast , and make it fun to watch . You should probably be very young ( or have a childlike mind ) to fully enjoy writer / director Norman Tokar's " Sammy - The Way-out Seal " - a colorful string of routine , deliberately staged scenes . The second half prominently features veteran Jack Carson ( as Harold Sylvester ) , in his last appearance ( died January 1963 ) . Robert Culp & Patricia Barry play the parents , and Ann Gillian ( as " Rocky " Sylvester ) helps round out the cast . Sammy - The Way-out Seal , pt 2 ( / 62 ) Norman Tokar - Michael McGreevey , Bill Mumy , Jack Carson

The pilot offers to take the duo up for a spin through the clouds ; Ms . Normand jumps at the chance , and enjoys her ride with the dashing Mr . Parmalee . The less brave , and relatively rotund , Mr . Mace is jealous . Later , Mace raises ire in a Mexican community , and needs the aviator's help ? Notable for its aerial Culver City , California location footage , photographed by Percy Higginson ; and , featuring aviator Parmalee , who worked with Wilbur Wright . Mack Sennett's " A Dash Through the Clouds " is also lifted by Normand and Mace . Jack Pickford ( Mary's little brother ) has one of his more substantial early roles , as the Mexican boy who assists Mace .
453661	15896852	37095	4.0	Wee Wilbert Winkle	Meek and mild Edward G . Robinson ( as Wilbert Winkle ) decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants , open a " fix-it " repair shop behind his house . Mr . Robinson is married , but childless ; he has befriended local orphanage resident Ted Donaldson ( as Barry ) . Young Donaldson is an eager workshop assistant , and sees Robinson as a father figure . Robinson's nagging wife Ruth Warwick ( as Amy ) is unhappy with Robinson's job choice , and conspires to return matters to her idea of normalcy . Their lives are further disrupted when Robinson is drafted . The war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story , as Robinson's character struggles against a domineering , unsympathetic wife . Possibly , filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives . Robinson and Donaldson are a likable team . Robert Mitchum has an inauspicious bit part . The ending " trick " played by Ms . Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged .
452368	15896852	61420	4.0	If You Don't Know Jack	I saw " Billy Jack " ( the next film ) first and believe it is the better Jack . There are many situations / elements in " Born Losers " which are more accessible in the later films . This " Born Losers " is mildly entertaining , I think , if you are more familiar with the character and situations Tom Laughlin creates . I don't think I would have been as interested if I didn't know Jack . So , I think a more involved Billy would have helped THIS movie - I kept waiting for Laughlin to perform , even if it's just to TALK more about his ( Jack's ) philosophies on life . The other interest is Jane Russell , in a supporting role . Her total film career reveals a versatility . Too bad movie makers didn't offer her more choice roles .

Dr . Joseph Goldberger ( played by Shepperd Strudwick ) , a Jewish immigrant , suspects the illness may be connected to nutrition . Mr . Goldberger's experiments , which include feeding Northern prisoners a Southern diet , are criticized as " torture " - but , Goldberger safely identifies the cause and cure for Pellagra . This episode of narrator John Nesbitt's " Passing Parade " is bracketed with Isaiah 44 : 19 , " Behold , I will do a new thing - I will even make a way in the wilderness . " Notable for Mr . Strudwick's convincing performance , and its director . Passing Parade : A Way in the Wilderness ( 1940 ) Fred Zinnemann - Shepperd Strudwick , John Nesbitt , Edward Hearn
453315	15896852	23996	4.0	That Sinking Feeling	The acronymic " F . P . 1 " stands for " Floating Platform # 1 " . The film portends the building of an " F . P . 1 " in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , to be used as an " air station " for transatlantic plane flights . Based a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel ; it was filmed in German as " F . P . 1 antwortet nicht " ( 1932 ) , in French as " I . F . 1 ne répond plus " ( 1933 ) , and in English as " F . P . 1 " ( 1933 ) . Soon , technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferable . Stars Conrad Veidt ( as Ellissen ) , Jill Esmond ( as Droste ) , and Leslie Fenton ( as Claire ) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform . Karl Hartl directed . Mr . Veidt is most fun to watch ; but , he is not convincing in the " love triangle " with Ms . Esmond and Mr . Fenton . The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak , respectively . Both the concept and film have not aged well .
453311	15896852	43829	4.0	West with Mickey	Mickey Rooney ( as J . Dennis " Denny " O'Moore ) is out west , looking to find his brother Robert Stack ( as Patrick O'Moore ) , whom he hasn't seen in eight years . Mr . Rooney meets up with Robert Preston ( as Joe Walter ) , who is looking for the notorious outlaw known as " El Tigre " . No prize for guessing how " El Tigre " is related to Rooney . Wanda Hendrix adds femininity to " My Outlaw Brother " . Tip your cowboy hat to Mickey Rooney , who is the film's greatest asset ; and , he gets the larger women . Mr . Stack is penetrating as Rooney's unlikely brother . Mr . Preston makes a good partner ; wisely , he is low key in the presence of Rooney . Just an interesting cast in a slight film .
452516	15896852	59245	4.0	The Passion of George Stevens	Re-telling the story of Jesus Christ , who founded Christianity , and inspired a myriad of movies . " The Greatest Story Ever Told " is one of those religious " EPIC " - SCREAMING presentations , which would bore even God to death . Upon entering the " Pearly Gates " , creator George Stevens ( at the time , one of the " Greatest " filmmakers in Hollywood ) must have received a few divine demerits for this production . Hopefully , he was forgiven . One can only imagine the number of excellent movies this budget , cast , and crew might have produced . The film's cost is evident , and Mr . Stevens is too good a director not to sneak in some nice touches ( like an angelic water reflection ) . Stevens is , however , more ponderous than reverential . The photography , by William Mellor ( who , sadly , suffered a fatal heart attack during the production ) and Loyal Griggs , is the film's main strength . Max von Sydow ( as Jesus ) works well , delivering the Savior envisioned by Stevens . The star-studded supporting cast varies in effectiveness . Charlton Heston's Herculean-looking " John the Baptist " grows on you , but John Wayne's infamous participation is obviously asinine ; others fall in between the cracks . The Greatest Story Ever Told ( 1965 ) George Stevens - Max von Sydow , Charlton Heston , John Wayne

452960	15896852	59221	4.0	Not Too Funny , Not Too Frightening	Mild-mannered newspaperman Don Knotts ( as Luther Heggs ) is assigned to spend a night in his small Kansas town's " haunted house " , on the 20-year anniversary of its ghastly murder / suicide . Mr . Knotts ' experience results in a sensational story about the Simmons house , " ghost-written " by his adept rival , reporter Skip Homeier ( as Ollie Weaver ) . Mr . Homeier is , also , Knotts ' rival for the affections of busty brunette Joan Stanley ( as Alma Parker ) . Anyway , the " Rachel Courier Express " story leads to a libel suit against Knotts , from the Simmons ( the homeowner's ) relatives . Knotts is nervously appealing ; however , this characterization and film do not compare well with either " Barney Fife " or " Mr . Limpet " . The " haunted house " evenings ( ? ) , set off with an obvious stunt double , are especially disappointing . However , musician Vic Mizzy , who composed " The Addams Family " , is noticeably effective . And , the strong supporting cast is full of recognizable TV faces , including two who will join the regulars on " Bewitched " . Not too funny , not too frightening ; give it an " attaboy " , for trying . The Ghost and Mr . Chicken ( 1966 ) Alan Rafkin - Don Knotts , Joan Staley , Skip Homeier

Hoping for a miracle treatment , the dancer visits a scientist who has had marvelous results in restoring patient's ( sic ) appearances , and is cured of her scars . Unfortunately , there are some terrible side-effects from the procedure ? the scientist must use unethical methods to try and make the cure permanent . With suspicions ( growing , and ) the dancer's boyfriend and the authorities closing in ? " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Inappropriately re-produced as " Atom Age Vampire " ; this is actually an adaptation of " The Strange Case of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde " , with some other horrific clichés , quite neatly layered into the mix . Mad scientist Alberto Lupo ( as Alberto Levin ) , unappreciated Franca Parisi ( as Monique ) , and lackey Roberto Bertea ( as Sacha ) are an intriguing set-up . Horribly dubbed ( although , the voices are good ) , and painfully predictable ; it very obviously wouldn't be a completely awful film , in its unaltered Italian version .

453641	15896852	52646	4.0	Go to the Head of the Class !	" A surgeon working on experimental transplant procedures seems to be on the verge of a major breakthrough with his technique , even though his surgeon father disapproves of his manner of research . While out driving with his fiancée , the doctor crashes his car and is horrified to discover his bride-to-be is decapitated . Rushing his fiancée's head to his lab , he is able to revive her where she is now living as a bodiless entity kept alive by tubes and an experimental serum . Hoping to restore his fiancée , the surgeon begins to bars and gentlemen's clubs looking or a candidate for transplanting his fiancée's head onto another body , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . After its so-so " operating room " opening , this film kicks into high gear , with dashing hero Jason Evers ( as Bill Cortner ) recklessly driving fiancée Virginia Leith ( Jan Compton ) into her accidental decapitation . Mr . Evers ' mad rush to carry her wrapped head home really draws your interest ; ironically , it's like watching a car wreck . Ms . Leith's head , sitting in what looks like Evers ' Thanksgiving roasting pan , is quite a sight . With the gore level about as high as it gets ( for the time ) , the film parades sexy , large-breasted women across the screen , as Evers searches for s suitable body for his fiancée's severed head . Meow . Leslie Daniels ( as Kurt ) has trouble keeping his arms to himself . Eddie Carmel adds tension , as the monster in the closet . Joseph Green's " Brain " is a lurid classic .

The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . J . Carrol Naish ( as Dr . Igor Markoff ) plays " The Monster Maker " in the low budget Bela Lugosi mode . Mr . Naish's serum causes a real disorder , " acromegaly " , which American Heritage defines as , " A chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities , face , and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland . " Ralph Morgan ( as Anthony Lawrence ) plays the afflicted man with some dignity . Pretty blonde Wanda McKay ( as Patricia " Pat " Lawrence ) is the daughter desired by mad scientist Naish ; in early scenes , Ms . McKay and Naish emote hilariously . Watch for Tala Birell ( as Maxine ) in a surprisingly good supporting performance ; she plays the somewhat Garbo-like , and long suffering , assistant to Naish . Ms . Birell definitely steals the film ; and , you've got to question Dr . Markoff's sanity in casting her aside . Glenn Strange ( as Steve ) and a crazed gorilla ( Ray Corrigan ) add to the fun . The monster makeup ( Maurice Seiderman ) is very good . The Monster Maker ( 1944 ) Sam Newfield - J . Carrol Naish , Ralph Morgan , Tala Birell
452940	15896852	292644	4.0	It's the End of the World as We Know It ( and I Feel Fine )	Self-centered college students party and have sex . The focus is a " love triangle " formed by : frustrated abstinent Shannyn Sossamon ( Lauren Hynde ) , promiscuous dealer James Van Der Beek ( Sean Bateman ) , and shallow homosexual Ian Somerhalder ( Paul Denton ) . All three are , actually , a combination of frustrated , promiscuous , and shallow - as are many other characters in the cast . Accent on shallow . Writer / director Roger Avary takes his cues from Bret Easton Ellis's novel " The Rules of Attraction " . Several characters from " Rules " have appeared in Mr . Avary's other books ; most notably , " Sean " is the younger brother of " Patrick Bateman " . Faye Dunaway , Swoosie Kurtz , Fred Savage , Eric Stoltz , and Paul Williams appear briefly ( one in briefs ) . The film has an " experimental " look , beginning with " backwards " motion . A split screen meeting between Mr . Van Der Beek and Ms . Sossamon is cute . But , the best part of the entire work is a short segment you could call " Victor's European Semester " . With dizzying detail , the character Kip Pardue ( as Victor ) narrates the sex-and-drugs details of his European trip . This small part of the film is amazing ; and , it's really all you need , to get the point . Due to this excellent montage , the story is lifted , momentarily , peaking with a hilarious reunion for " Lauren and " Victor " .

452752	15896852	334541	4.0	Back Up Your Arsenal	The fourth " Tremors " feature goes back in time , to the year 1889 . " The Legend Begins " in the small city of " Perfection " , which was then " Rejection , Nevada " . As the story begins , seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly " Graboids " . Some of the characters in the present-day " Tremors " films have ancestors , both figurative and literal , in the past . Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross ( as Hiram Gummer ) . Unlike his descendant , Mr . Gross is inept with firearms ; so , he hires gunslinger Billy Drago ( as " Black Hand " Kelly ) to shoot ' em up some " Dirt Dragons " . This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past . It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster " Graboids " . These tamer " Dirt Dragons " are nowhere near as terrorizing as their " Tremors " ( 1990 ) counterparts . Consequently , in this film , the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground , which would not have happened in the original movie . And , it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly , when Gross temporarily decides to leave town . Why so helpless ? Why didn't Brent Roam ( as Juan Pedilla ) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross ? Disappointing . Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins ( 2004 ) S . S .

Now , hold on , Lindsay reveals she's also a double agent , when Lester returns home and recognizes her as Nurse Helene . . . Third time around for " Three Faces East " ( 1926 , 1930 ) . Fairly predictable , if you think about it - - but Karloff and Lindsay are fun to watch .
453544	15896852	258534	4.0	Another Picture of Dorian Gray	The story is familiar - recall , original novelist Oscar Wilde's " Dorian " wished his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . Like in days of old , handsome male model Ethan Erickson ( as Louis ) wishes for eternal youth . Then , while one of his pictures ages , he becomes the ageless " Dorian " of the title . Like his predecessors , Mr . Erickson descends into decadent debauchery . A charismatic older mentor , Malcolm McDowell ( as Henry ) , eggs him on . . . Re-titled " Pact with the Devil " . Allan A . Goldstein's updated " Dorian " alters the story in ways that become nonsensical . The main problem occurs by making Mr . McDowell's character semi-Faustian . To have McDowell in the cast , and render his character inexplicable , should be a crime . Erickson , an extremely good-looking man , is also slighted by a faltering characterization - in an early scene , he is required to pretend he couldn't imagine someone thinking he could be a pin-up boy ? And , Jennifer Nitsch ( as Bae ) has an undeveloped , but intriguing , back-story . Dorian ( 2001 ) Allan A . Goldstein - Ethan Erickson , Malcolm McDowell , Jennifer Nitsch
452492	15896852	32304	4.0	All a-Bored	This misty , seafaring film looks and sounds very beautiful , and atmospheric . I just couldn't get involved with the story ; and found the acting fantastically uneven . I can imagine the direction given to Victor Mature before he enters the French tavern - " Enter left and look startled ! " - The ship had a sort of " beatnik / hippie " type character on board . The French waitress was cast against type , I though . The characters really treat her poorly ! I wonder , is the film's message that women are " bad luck " ? It's a fair film - probably , kids in theaters would have enjoyed spending an afternoon in the theater on the " Captain Caution " ship . If I was a 10-year-old kid boy the ' 40s , I would have liked this movie more . Captain Caution ( 1940 ) Richard Wallace - Victor Mature , Louise Platt , Leo Carrillo

When the banker turns up but appears to be in a trance , Trayne must now try to find out what happened to the banker . A household full of suspects makes for a tough case that our crack detective must solve and bring the culprit to justice , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This variation of the " old dark house " plot is more tired than true . " The Living Ghost " angle turns out to be a good idea , but zombie Gus Glassmire ( as Walter Craig ) doesn't get enough screen time to really frighten . Writers Howard Dimsdale and Joseph Hoffman do well , considering . Detective James Dunn ( as Trayne ) and adorable Joan Woodbury ( as Billie Hilton ) are a delightful couple of sleuths . The supporting roles are performed admirably - right down to Harry Depp ( as Homer Hawkins ) . If only the production were kicked up a notch , or two ?

" Philip K . Dick's original story would make a great film ; unfortunately , this poorly executed and overproduced " Paycheck " doesn't really cash it in . The film could be used as a guide on how not to bring Mr . Dick's " Paycheck " to the big screen . Still , it's mildly fun to watch protagonist " Michael Jennings " sort out , and use , the 20 items he mailed to his amnesiac self . The acting and direction ( John Woo ) is obvious . Ivana Milicevic gives it as much PG sex appeal as she can muster . Paycheck ( 2003 ) John Woo - Ben Affleck , Uma Thurman , Aaron Eckhart

Starring Antonio Banderas , Salma Hayek , Johnny Depp , Mickey Rourke , Eva Mendes , Enrique Iglesias , and Willem Dafoe , ' Once Upon a Time in Mexico ' is a full-frontal assault , " according to the DVD sleeve . That's about as good a description of this blood-splattering , testicle-crunching Robert Rodriguez film as you're going to get . Mr . Rodriguez borrows the title , some of the style , but little of the greatness from Sergio Leone's " Once Upon a Time in the West " . Hard to dope it all out .

At one point , Edward Norris ( as Philip Bennett ) is asked , " What do you think this is , Boys Town ? " Mr . Norris should know , since he was in " Boys Town " .

The scientist's daughter Lenora grows wary of her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter . When the scientist loses control of his creature , it falls upon the scientist's daughter and the reporter to stop it , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Mad scientist George Zucco ( as Lorenzo Cameron ) creates his formula rather unimaginatively , by mixing human and wolf blood . This brings the beast out in hulking Glenn Strange ( as Petro aka Pedro ) , who is directed to act like Lon Chaney Jr . in " Of Mice and Men " . Johnny Downs ( as Tom Gregory ) and Anna Nagel ( as Lenora Cameron ) are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress . Certainly , " The Mad Monster " is no substitute for " The Wolf Man " ; but , it's a serviceable addendum . The grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy , cow-webbed atmosphere . " God " ( uncredited ) strikes up a well-done ending , too . Like Blaine ( Robert Strange ) said , " Mingling the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege !

Unfortunately , only twelve people show up for dinner and the host dies before he can reveal the heir's identity . Years later , the host's daughter returns to her long boarded-up family home to discover someone is killing off the dinner guests , making everyone wonder who will be the next victim . " In the opening scene , Ginger Rogers ( as Marie Morgan and Lela ) ' s recollections introduce the " guests " , and reveal something critical about the plot . Ms . Rogers and Lyle Talbot ( as Phil Winston ) make the cast look promising ; but , the real attractions are James Eagles ( as Harold " Bud " Morgan ) and Eddie Phillips ( as Thor Jensen ) , due to the matter-of-fact way their likely relationship is depicted . This , and the " you told me to tail her " joke , near the end , are better than this otherwise dreary version of a done-to-death plot .

Horrified , virtuous Holly jumps ship . Ashore , Mr . Hart senses the danger ( with the help of a well-timed letter ) , and rushes to the rescue . Recovering from her near-drowning , Holly pleads with Hart not to seek vengeance . Later , Mr . Gaden disguises himself with a beard ; in town , he causes trouble for Hart and his sweetheart , brown-eyed bank cashier Vola Vale ( as Barbara ) . Ms . Vale also has trouble fending off the advances of lecherous step-father Bert Sprotte ( as Eliphalet Moss ) . After attempting rape , Mr . Sprotte turns up dead . Vale's long-lost brother also turns up . Hart is accused of killing Sprotte , and jailed . Vale joins a traveling Wagon Train , with the always sexually-charged Gaden . " Indians " mix in ; as it turns out , Gaden has had his way with an Indian lass . There are several good scenes , helped by the photography of Joe August ; but , William S . Hart's over-produced , over-plotted tale of reluctant vengeance doesn't compare with his earlier work . Only a dog named " Jeff " could sort " White Oak " out . Woof , woof !

Barthelmess is admired by pretty hometown girl Barbara Kent ( as Cecily Graves ) . At school , the player is pursued by vamp Dorothy Revier ( as Eunice Hathaway ) . Ms . Revier is a newlywed , but doesn't let it " cramp her style " . She used to date Barthelmess , before she married his best friend , and coach , Eugene Strong ( as Brad Hathaway ) . Mr . Strong has a difficult time balancing his budget . Soon , Barthelmess ' college career is threatened by an unexpected shooting ? Barthelmess gives it the old college try , but " The Drop Kick " doesn't score . It's odd that this routine , and not very credible , film was released between " The Noose " and " The Patent Leather Kid " , two films which brought Barthelmess Academy Award consideration . The football scenes are okay ; but , the visual highlight is the " windmill dance " at the gymnasium . Revier , as the coach's wife , is the most interesting player . John Wayne appears inauspiciously , as an extra . " Wild " Bill Elliott is more noteworthy , making a forward play , at the dance .

He finds Doris Day - a significant improvement ! The story is similar to " A Star Is Born " . How Ms . Day goes undiscovered for so long with such a striking voice is not convincing . Day is a single parent ( in the film , it is stated that she lost her husband during World War II ) , which helps set up the film's highlight - a cute dream sequence for her son features an animated Bugs Bunny . The soundtrack isn't exceptional , but Day performs the songs well . " My Dream Is Yours " is colorful and routine . My Dream Is Yours ( 1949 ) Michael Curtiz - Doris Day , Jack Carson , Eve Arden

At first , Mr . Taylor's confident cockiness rubs everyone the wrong way ; but , he earns his comrades ' respect , through charm and ability . Taylor also catches the eye of otherwise happily married Ruth Hussey ( as Lorna Gary ) , wife of " Hell Cat " commander Walter Pidgeon ( as William " Billy " Gray ) . Will their " love triangle " be consummated ? Ordinary flag-waving film , ostensibly about Taylor fitting in with his squadron ; however , the war sacrifices Ms . Hussey makes become the film's main focus . The supporting players outperform the leads ; in particular , Shepperd Strudwick ( as Jerry Banning ) and Paul Kelly ( as Dusty Rhodes ) . Mr . Strudwick's " fog device " provides an interesting sub-plot . The inter-cut " fog device " visual is an example of one of the film's irritants . Frank Borzage ( direction ) and Harold Rosson ( photography ) make some scenes look nice .

So , O'Donnell , with pal Artie Lange ( as Marco ) assisting , tries to locate a marriage-minded woman , who is willing to share $100 million , and produce a baby . Any takers ? Ms . Shelton is a sweet sidekick , and Brooke Shields ( as Buckley ) stands out among the unfortunately wasted supporting cast .

452517	15896852	43547	4.0	Never Getting Off the Ground	Don't get too excited about the prospect of seeing John Wayne and Robert Ryan in a Nicholas Ray-directed World War II drama . Considering those three names , " Flying Leathernecks " does not meet expectations . It's a mediocre Howard Hughes-RKO-commissioned war movie . Mr . Ray shows off his most " production line " direction . Mr . Wayne ( as Dan Kirby ) and Mr . Ryan ( as Carl " Griff " Griffin ) have an vacuous attitude conflict ; it's interesting to watch their acting techniques , without being distracted by a sensible story . A script highlight is the cute reference to the nursery rhyme " Jack and Jill went up the hill ? " Jay C . Flippen ( as Clancy ) provides additional " comic relief " , but check out the " narration track " , for real laughs . Also notable is the inclusion of several scenes from the actual war , in color ; however , this footage would be more appropriately seen in a documentary .

He is accompanied by drunken driver George ' Gabby ' Hayes ( as Dave ) , and the ranch owner's distaff kin : Audrey Long ( as Clara Cardell ) and Elisabeth Risdon ( as Elizabeth Martin ) . Mr . Wayne bonds with boozy Mr . Hayes ; they share a chauvinistic dislike for women . Ms . Long is attracted to Wayne ; but , soon , so is tomboyish rancher Ella Raines ( as Arly Harolday ) . While the primly sensual Long and the fiery cowgirl Raines flirt unmercifully with him , Wayne must solve the murder of the freshly shot dead ranch owner . " Tall in the Saddle " is a mostly haphazard , unsatisfying western , highlighted by strong , familiar supporting performers . And , the film's women make most enjoyable viewing . Raines and blonde rival Long are great-looking ; and give great looks , to both Wayne and each other . Raines's cowgirl outfit is snug and sexy . Long is primly attired , but sensual ; a fact noticed by Raines as the women deliciously play a " check out the competition " scene . Veteran actress Risdon is the perfect contrast , a straight-laced old aunt . Sidekick Hayes gets to pal around ( too briefly ) with veteran actor Raymond Hatton ( as Zeke ) in some early scenes .

This time , the leading threesome form the more traditional triangle of love - - younger Marine pilot Ralph Graves ( as Lefty Phelps ) and his mentor / Sergeant Jack Holt as ( Panama Williams ) are in both love with lovely nurse Lila Lee ( as Elinor Murray ) . Ms . Lee loves Mr . Graves ( in a romantic way ) . Mr . Graves loves Lee ( in a romantic way ) and Mr . Holt ( in a fatherly way ) . Circumstances put the characters ' relationships in turmoil , and danger ? An interesting early effort by director Frank Capra ; but , of course , it is nowhere near his best . Harold Goodwin has a great supporting role ( as Steve Roberts ) . Graves and Holt are a reliable team . Graves seems a little younger and Holt a little older than they appear ; the actors are about the same age , however ; and , they have a nice rapport . Watch for a scene right after the " stuck in the mud " segment concludes - - in their tent , Holt scolds Graves for wanting to go out and get " tight " ; he tries to pull his pal's shirt off , but Graves resists . Then , the men wrestle , which ends up with Holt pulling Graves ' legs up to give him a spanking ! As a bonus , Graves ' hairpiece almost flips off his head !
452394	15896852	25747	4.0	For Laughing on ye Sabbath	This film is probably most notable , in hindsight , as containing the last cinematic performance from Colleen Moore , one of the great " silent " stars of the 1920s . Ms . Moore's portrayal of Hester Prynne is neither great nor representative , but it does reveal the actress had the ability to carry on making pictures with sound . Sadly , the available material proved unworthy of Moore . This is an uninspired , and unnecessary , attempt at a more comic version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's " The Scarlet Letter " ; it is more listless than lighthearted . The drama is provided by the classic literary trio of characters : Moore as Hester Prynne , Hardie Albright as Arthur Dimmesdale , and Henry B . Walthall as Roger Chillingworth . The comedy is provided by Alan Hale as Bartholomew Hockings , William Kent as Sampson Goodfellow , Virginia Howell as Abigail Crakstone , and others . In a close call , but the comedy side of the story is slightly more entertaining . Mr . Hale's performance is the most enjoyable of the comic players ; significantly , he is able take all the attention off Mr . Albright , during one of the latter's dramatic sermons , as Reverend Dimmesdale . Mr . Walthall , who performed the same character in the far superior 1926 version , with Lillian Gish , is interesting to watch ; but , his attempt at a faithful portrayal of Chillingworth does not match the surrounding production . Adorable Cora Sue Collins plays " Pearl " Shirley Temple-like - - this is understandable , given the time of release - - consider , especially , the scene when Ms . Moore and her little girl take swords , begin a dancing march , and chant , " Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! " Cora , take a bow !

" The movie's story is likewise without direction . For what seems like an interminable length of time , the volcano Krakatoa spurts and sputters - - you are teased by the threatening eruption . During this time , the film should be providing its great characterizations ; so , you really care about the people who are soon to be blanketed with volcanic lava and / or tsunami waters . That doesn't exactly happen . Some of the special effects are explosive . Stars Maximilian Schell ( as Captain Hanson ) and Diane Baker ( as Laura ) are fine performers , who seem to be trying their best with the material . Brian Keith ( as Connerly ) is wasted . Sal Mineo ( as Leoncavallo ) is the best supporting player ; though the director cuts away from him a little too soon following a nice " goodbye " scene with father Rossano Brazzi , it shows the most unused potential . Mr . Mineo resembles Marlon Brando in pensive medium shots - - too bad he didn't get more Brando-caliber scripts . Krakatoa , East of Java ( 1969 ) Bernard L .

As is the case in most Civil War stories , the opposing soldiers once had a close relationship ; in this case , they were West Point buddies . Mr . Craig is also in love with a beautiful woman , Barbara Payton ( as Kathy Summers ) . This is a fairly predictable Civil War story . The dramatics are enhanced by Ms . Payton in the feminine lead . Payton is the most interesting player in the middling " Drums in the Deep South " ; with a better part , and direction , Payton might have been a much bigger star . Her biography is sad , and typical .

A restless and melancholy teenager , DuVall becomes intrigued with older blond Daryl Hannah ( as Sabine ) . Beautiful and freaky Ms . Hannah doesn't seem to want to have anything to do with DuVall . Thinking the woman is her long-lost mother , DuVall uses a mutual lover , Eric Roberts ( as Jacob ) , to learn about Hannah , and herself . Paul Ryan's photography is the film's main strength . DuVall is endearing . It's nice to see Roberts in a more " artistic " film . However , Melissa Painter's " Wildflowers " are just of reach .

Another B & W film from his later years might be similar , I thought . I was very disappointed . This movie had , I thought , MORE going in : like , famed Director Michael Curtiz , and co-star Carolyn Jones . They were not at their best . As others have noticed , Ms . Jones does a totally-out-of-the-blue Bette Davis impression . I would have spotted her as a boozy floozy right off the bat , but even her BEST friend has no clue ? ? ? Mr . Ladd , great in " 13 West Street " and one of the only things worth watching in " The Carpetbaggers " ( 1964 ) , is not very good . The story is very weak . How is it that all the townspeople are stupid and their children so smart ? Despite the weakness of the premise , there are some interestingly played scenes ; the film does have a structure , which is easy and somewhat satisfying to follow , despite the implausibility .

452862	15896852	25822	4.0	Casting Stones	Spitfire ( 1934 ) John Cromwell - Katharine Hepburn , Ralph Bellamy , Robert Young Mountain hillbilly Katharine Hepburn ( as Trigger Hicks ) is a religious back-woods laundry woman . " Going on 18 " , she begins to attract male attention , and responds by throwing rocks . The arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in Ms . Hepburn . She quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer Robert Young ( as John Stafford ) , who flirtingly hides his marital status . Supervising engineer Ralph Bellamy ( as George Fleetwood ) is also interested in Hepburn , but for different reasons ; Mr . Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ , whom Hepburn worships . After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child , neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch . If it weren't so serious , " Spitfire " might be more amusing ; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star , who is thoroughly unconvincing . Of the leads , Mr . Bellamy performs best . However , the best characterization is essayed by Sarah Haden ( as Etta Dawson ) , who appeared in George Cukor's stage version , along with Louis Mason ( as Bill Grayson ) . Will Geer ( as West Fry ) , " Grandpa Walton " in the 1970s , has a small role . An unexpected ending helps .
452755	15896852	14721	4.0	Imitation of Life	At the opening of " The Undesired " , a New York play , the audience is stunned by the incredible beauty of Corinne Griffith , who simply stands up from her seat . Brilliant theater critic , and budding playwright , Conway Tearle ( as Lee Clavering ) is among those smitten by the ravishing Ms . Griffith . Mr . Tearle insists he must meet her . Elderly gossip Tom Ricketts ( as Charles Dinwiddie ) is more shocked than enthralled , because the mysterious young woman looks exactly like a lady he dated 30 years ago ; Mr . Ricketts explains the woman was " Mary Ogden " , who should be old and feeble , presently . Griffith claims to be her lookalike's niece . But , old friend Kate Lester ( as Jane Ogelthorpe ) says " Mary Ogden " had no siblings . Griffith and Tearle fall in love . As things turn out , the originally hinted at science fiction angle is dispensed with . Before the film's " flashback " , Griffith reveals she is " an old woman of sixty , whose youth has been restored to her by a modern miracle of science . " This follows the explanation offered in writer Gertrude Atherton's autobiographical " Black Oxen " ( 1923 ) . Ms . Atherton wrote about her own " youthful " restoration . The process , or " Steinach treatment " , rejuvenated a woman's youth and vitality by X-raying her ovaries . Interestingly , in real life , actress Griffith employed a different ( and , likely , more effective ) " youth restoration " technique - - she claimed to be her own much younger sister . On film , she looks lovely , but there isn't much depth in Griffith's characterization ; she and Tearle essay a common romance . During the flashback , Griffith looks more tired than old ; and , before the process , she doesn't look at all old enough to be a " woman of sixty " . Griffith's reason for contemplating youth is not as interesting or realistic as supporting character Claire McDowell ( as Agnes Trevor ) . Ms . McDowell's motivation would have made a more interesting film . A real " flaming youth " , Clara Bow ( as Janet Oglethorpe ) , plays a delightful young " flapper " who has a crush older man Tearle . The last quarter of " Black Oxen " is missing , but it's not too difficult to determine how it all ends . Black Oxen ( 1923 ) Frank Lloyd - Corinne Griffith , Conway Tearle , Clara Bow

Elwyn Clayton ) , practitioner of the Black Arts , who has just been slain , by his abel ( okay , able ) look-alike brother George Zucco ( as Dr . Lloyd Clayton ) . The film's first mistake is not showing the murder ; instead , it is explained , by " bad " Zucco's companion Dwight Frye ( as Zolarr ) . As the vampire , Zucco keeps it all in the family by repeatedly going for the neck of pretty blonde niece Mary Carlisle ( Gayle Clayton ) , quite like they did on " Dark Shadows " . Ms . Carlisle's boyfriend , Nedrick Young ( Dr . David Bently ) , is , initially , nonplussed . Story development is unoriginal ; obviously , filmmakers expected everyone was familiar with the " Dracula " plot . This variation lets its possibilities slip away by leaving interesting new stones unturned . The graveyard scenes are atmospheric ; possibly , they are enhanced by the low budget . The film's conclusion really fires things up ; but , a lack of characterization and originality regarding the ending confrontation is a damper . The cast and crew perform well , under the circumstances . Dead Men Walk ( 1943 ) Sam Newfield - George Zucco , Mary Carlisle , Nedrick Young

O'Neill was a natural choice to preserve his " own " interpretation of Dumas ' classic on film , as a " Famous Players " film production . Unfortunately , apart from Dantes ' voyage , this isn't much of a film ; most often , Edwin S . Porter's camera acts like a bored audience member . It's too bad , because Mr . O'Neill , even in his mature years , appears capable . The star's playwright son Eugene O'Neill based the character " James Tyrone " from " Long Day's Journey Into Night " on his father . And , the character in that play seems like he could be the actor here playing " The Count of Monte Cristo " . This is one to see if you're a film historian .

With " Beach " in the title and Virginia Mayo in the credits , you know what you're getting with " The Girl from Jones Beach " - ankles , legs , knees , torso ? but , stay calm , it's a 1949 film .

452631	15896852	6932	4.0	Bear with What Drink Did	Henry King ( as Bob Daley ) and Marguerite Nichols ( as Sylvia Sanford ) are engaged ; to celebrate , Mr . King goes out drinking with the boys . Meanwhile , " Baby " Marie Osborne ( as " Little " Mary ) sits with her ailing ( or abused ) mother Mollie McConnell . She gets Ms . McConnell a drink , and plays with her doll . King continues to drink ; so much so , he is late for a theater date with Ms . Nichols . Then , Mary's father stumbles home , obviously drunk , and fights with his wife . King finally arrives for his date , stumbling drunk ; furious , Nichols ends their engagement , and throws him out . Elsewhere , Osborne runs away from home ; her mother has died . So that she can get to Heaven faster , and see her mother again , " Little Mary " stows away in a fast car ; there , she meets the despondent King . Has Providence provided King's life with meaning ? This " Sunbeam " was a cute draw for viewers ; so , King starred in several more films with " Baby " Marie Osborne . King was more renown as a director ; and , Marguerite Nichols was , arguably , more renown as Mrs . Hal Roach . The early 1900s cars are very cool . The adults are more interesting viewing than the little girl - - her antics with a live bear are unsettling . Still , " Mr . Bear " always appears gentle on screen , even when chasing " Baby " Marie , after she gives him a bath , thanks to Providence , no doubt .

But soon the horrible truth about their ' vacation ' surfaces . Betty's husband doesn't intend to bring his family back to America . . . ever . She may return , he says , but their daughter must stay . In a hostile , war-torn country , where even the slightest misstep can mean death , she makes a desperate bid to escape with her child , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This Iranian husband , who reads newspapers at work printed in his own language , doesn't know how much his country has changed ? What on EARTH did Ms . Field's character see in this psychopath ? Did they cut the scene where someone deposits a giant pea-pod in his Iranian backyard ? The relationship between the two principles is totally unbelievable , with Mr . Molina faring the worse . One wonders what " American " citizens thought of Iranian immigrants after watching this film in 1991 . But , it plays ( as a monster " moody " ) .

The new angels are : " Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel " Natalie Cook ( Cameron Diaz ) , " Angel of the Morning " Dylan Sanders ( Drew Barrymore ) , and " Undercover Angel " Alex Munday ( Lucy Liu ) . Those songs introduce the angels ; and , the production is filled with music video-type songs . Ms . Diaz's bootylicious dancing proves baby has back . Ms . Barrymore's wide open shirt will push your PG-13 buttons . And , Ms . Liu's dominatrix scenes are to die for . The three as singing Swiss Maids ( if that's what they are ? you'll know the scene ) are wet dreamy . Mr . Murray's " Bosley " lacks the innocent fey-amongst-hotness manner which make David Doyle's portrayal so successful . The new angels are fine , but their screenplay is flat .

After a few months of private bliss , an accidental murder ends their love affair . District Attorney Alan Dinehart ( as John Grant ) is assigned to prosecute Johann . Mr . Dinehart helped Cavanagh to win a state governorship , and is the brother of his cheated-on wife . Dinehart also narrates the story . Phil Goldstone's " The Sin of Nora Moran " is a structurally interesting , but ultimately fair-to-middling movie .

452550	15896852	57066	4.0	Where the Boys Aren't	Four women , in various stages of romantic pursuit , " Follow the Boys " ( men , actually ) around European ports , mostly from a dilapidated old jalopy . The four females are : Connie Francis ( as Bonnie Pulaski ) , Paula Prentiss ( as Toni Denham ) , Janis Paige ( as Liz Bradville ) , and Dany Robin ( as Michele Perrier ) . Their " Boys " are : Russ Tamblyn ( as Wadsworth Smith ) , Richard Long ( as Peter Langley ) , Roger Perry ( as Billy Pulaski ) , and Ron Randell ( as Ben Bradville ) . The cast is likable ; but , the film is dull . Ms . Francis , not coincidently MGM's top selling recording artist , is especially noteworthy ; with relatively little experience in films , she performs as well as anyone . However , Francis isn't given enough to do ; and , neither is anyone else , as the film tries to feature everyone . After an Italian wine-stomping event , all's well that ends well .
453127	15896852	33760	4.0	Guess Who's Coming to Dinner ?	Invisible Ghost ( 1941 ) Joseph H . Lewis - Bela Lugosi , Clarence Muse , Betty Compson " Bella Lugosi stars in this Monogram thriller as Charles Kessler , a man living with his daughter while hoping for the return of his wife . Upon seeing her peeking through a window , he falls into a trance and murders the maid . The maid's boyfriend is framed for the murder and dies in the hands of the police . The man's twin brother and Kessler's daughter team up to clear the brother's name and discover the true identity of the killer , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . First of all , there is no " Invisible Ghost " . This was the first of Mr . Lugosi's " Monogram " movies ; and , predictably , the studio sought to cash-in on its star's previous horror success with the misleading title . The " ghost " is Betty Compson ( as Mrs . Kessler ) who survived a car crash while attempting to run away with her lover . Ms . Compson's status , and the identity of the killer , are not mysteries . Surprisingly , this does not , in itself , make the film uninteresting . With better scripting ( more attentive to character development and motivation and performances ) , " Invisible Ghost " could have been a fine picture . Though poorly edited , at times , the direction is sometimes artful ; for example , consider the slipshod scene regarding Jules ' " death " and the excellent " The Lord Is My Sheppard ? " sequence . The " romantic " couple , Polly Ann Young ( sister of Loretta , ending her film career ) and John McGuire would have benefited from more work on their characterizations ; interestingly Mr . McGuire's " Paul Dickson " is an improvement over his " Ralph Dickson " . A couple of supporting performances rise above the material . Compson's portrayal of the " crazed-with-guilt " wife is dead-on ; and , Clarence Muse ( as Evans ) ' s portrayal of Lugosi's manservant is a lesson in dignified acting .
452474	15896852	39501	4.0	Time After Time	Jazzy singer Frank Sinatra ( as Danny Webson Miller ) returns to Brooklyn , after serving during World War II . Mr . Sinatra moves in with his old high school janitor Jimmy Durante ( as Nick Lombardi ) . Sinatra suffers not from " shell shock " , but from " stage fright " , as he tries to make it in the music business . He falls in love with operatic soprano Kathryn Grayson ( as Anne Fielding ) . A " love triangle " is formed when visiting pal Peter Lawford ( as Jamie Shellgrove ) also falls for Ms . Grayson . Not much of a movie , really . Sinatra is the highlight ; he sings the timeless classic " Time After Time " , and other songs written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne . Sinatra and Mr . Durante are a likable team , performing " The Song's Gotta Come from the Heart " and " I Believe " , the latter with young Bobby Long ( as Johnny O'Brien ) . Young pianist Billy Roy ( as Leo Kardos ) performs well . Sexy Gloria Grahame has an early walk around appearance . Sinatra's accompanying Columbia single was , deservedly , an instant double-sided hit : " I Believe " ( # 5 ) / " Time After Time " ( # 16 ) .

453414	15896852	22273	4.0	Dressler for Mayor	" This story is dedicated to women , " according to the introduction , " who have been fighting for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system . " When " Politics " was filmed , the Nineteenth Amendment , guaranteeing women the right to vote , was only a decade old . And , the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group . Advocating prohibition , and shutting down speakeasies , was a main concern for women at the time . Good-natured Marie Dressler ( as Hattie Burns ) becomes politically active , after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy . She wants the liquor-selling joints closed ; and , is drafted into a Mayoral run , after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally . Ms . Dressler is supported by her tenants , best friend Polly Moran ( as Ivy Higgins ) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates ( as Peter Higgins ) . Dressler's run for Mayor of Lake City draws opposition from men in town ; so , Dressler orders the women to go on strike , denying them , " everything " in the " parlor , bedroom , and bath . " The film sounds much better than it turned out . The humor , frankly , isn't too good ; and , it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations ( " You look like Madame Queen " refers to an Amos and Andy character ) . And , the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well , this time . Producers might have considered making the film more dramatic , focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell ( as Benny Emerson ) and Karen Morley ( as Myrtle Burns ) .

452698	15896852	58700	4.0	I Am Legend ( Not )	As many others note , the plot and several scenes are eerily similar to the superior " Night of the Living Dead " . The fact that this film came first , and probably inspired the latter film , does not mean this film should be elevated ; it is not good . It isn't even original , being another adaptation of " I Am Legend " . I found myself wondering how Mr . Price's character is able to hold up in that house for a number of years - - Who keeps the electricity running ? How are food and water supplied ? Why don't these obviously very intelligent ( despite their appearance ) ghouls figure out a way to get into Price's house ? Well , those are only the beginning questions ? Price could have been helped by a bigger film budget . I thought the dog turned in the finest acting performance . The worst performance was that of the crying baby ; I guess the baby's Italian cry had to be dubbed into an English cry ?

453117	15896852	20143	4.0	Marion Meets the Moustache	Marion Davies moves unsteadily into sound films , as the title character in the musical " Marianne " . This was Davies ' first sound film ; a silent version was filmed earlier . In her first aural offering , Ms . Davies combines silent mannerisms with a sometimes lilting , sometimes grunting French accent . Davies is admired by several U . S . soldiers , but mostly Lawrence Gray ( as Stagg ) . Mr . Gray helps retrieve Davies ' stolen pig , albeit mostly eaten . There are several embarrassing scenes , but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin ( Sam ) and Cliff Edwards ( Soapy ) serenading a distraught Davies . This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends , in drag , while bragging about her intimacy with a General . Later on , she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt . They are not as fun as they sound ! Mr . Rubin sings " The Girl from Neufchâteau " extremely well , though ; his is the film's best musical performance . The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap . The scene works because Davies , instead of playing a French woman , play-acts a French officer . Here , she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures . You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball ; especially , recall Ms . Ball's " Lucy Meets the Moustache " ( 1960 ) . It is most obvious Ball referenced some of Davies ' comic work .

Upon arrival , he is told what we've seen open the film , that brother Rod Wilson ( as Michael McLean ) blew up in a car . Mr . Dillon identifies his brother's burned-beyond-recognition body by observing his tattooed arm . You'd be suspicious , and Dillon is too . He discovers his brother was ( is ? ) tied up in a web of espionage . The Berlin morgue makes room for more bodies , as unsavory types search for a missing computer disk , thought to be in one of the McLean brothers ' possession . Dillon befriends pretty blonde motorcycling Andrea Roth ( as Monika Engelmann ) who , of course , is also interested in finding the disk . Supporting actors Christopher Plummer ( as Ulrich Steiner ) , J . T . Walsh ( as Jonathan Zanuck ) , and Michael Wincott ( as Larry Gleason ) give the picture some weight . Mr . Plummer works out of the Berlin police department ; in a sex shop , he suggests a nuns in bondage video . Mr . Walsh and Mr . Wincott are situated at the American Embassy . Wincott is soft-spoken , but powerful . This was dependable character actor Walsh's last filmed appearance . So , Iain Paterson's " Hidden Agenda " is , appropriately , " Dedicated to the memory of J . T . Walsh . " Hidden Agenda ( 1998 ) Iain Paterson - Kevin Dillon , Andrea Roth , J . T . Walsh
453380	15896852	74384	4.0	Swipe of Dark Shadows	Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner ( as Joel Gregory ) and Kate Jackson ( as Donna Gregory ) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress " Lorna Love " ( actually , silent film star Harold Lloyd's house ) . Mr . Wagner and Ms . Jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star's biography . Wagner has a personal interest in the project , since his father was once the famed star's lover . Mysterious events unfold , and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde , who is " perfectly preserved " in a crypt on the estate ; moreover , the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband , and murdering Jackson ! This is very much a " Night of Dark Shadows " variation , co-starring genuine " Dark Shadows " alumni Kate Jackson , who knows and plays her part well . Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity . Sylvia Sidney ( as Mrs . Josephs ) sidesteps Grayson Hall . Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker ( or Diana Millay ) . Bill Macy ( as Oscar Payne ) is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen ( in a Dan Curtis production ) . There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell , John Carradine , and Dorothy Lamour . Ms . Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett , which begs the question : why didn't producer Aaron Spelling get more of the original " Dark Shadows " regulars ? Director E . W . Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband ; he worked with Ms . Blondell on " Here Come the Brides " , and with Jackson on " The Rookies " . " Death at Love House " has , arguably , a tighter storyline than the " Night of Dark Shadows " film ; it differs in the movie star angle ; and , in its " Father Eternal Fire " ending , it more closely resembles the TVseries ' " Laura the Phoenix " storyline .

453491	15896852	349531	4.0	A Thanksgiving Story with Chorus	A modest wheat-growing family prepares for their " Harvest " . The southern foursome are : mother Dorothy Gish ( as Ellen Zalinka ) , father Ed Begley ( as Karl ) , son James Dean ( as Paul ) , and elderly Vaughn Taylor ( as " Gramp " ) . Mr . Taylor is looking forward to celebrating his 100th birthday . Ms . Gish has bought some new clothes , anticipating a healthy harvest . Mr . Dean is ending a summer affair with " city girl " Rebecca Welles ( as Arlene Ross ) ; but , he hopes to marry her , and leave the family farm . However , Dean is racked with restless guilt ; his two older brothers have already moved away , and he is the farm family's last hope . Father Begley thinks , " Farming's the most important thing in the world , " but Dean wants out . Suddenly , a violent hailstorm destroys the family's crop . Taylor dies , without realizing his 100th birthday dream . Then , Dean loses his girlfriend and joins the Navy ? This " Robert Montgomery Presents ? " drama certainly features a terrific " ensemble " cast . Mr . Montgomery promises " a talk " with Gish at the hour's conclusion ; but , it consists of only a " thank you " , and invitation to return for another teleplay . Mainly , " Harvest " is an opportunity to see Gish and Dean perform together , as mother and son . They do well , considering the medium . After performing a good scene together , Gish and Dean are unfazed by a stubborn coat rack ( there were no re-takes ) . By the fall of 1953 , Dean was appearing so frequently on television , he might as well have had his own daily dramatic program . He was a popular " juvenile " player . Dean's best scene may be the dinner he shares with the sophisticated " city " family in their summer cabin ; don't miss him offering to help " Herb " into his chair . The " city " and " country " table manners are fun to watch , thanks to Dean and Gish . Also , keep an eye out for " middle son " John Connell ( as Chuck ) , who outperforms ( albeit in a smaller role ) Begley , Dean , and Gish . Congratulations , Mr . Connell , you win the farm ! Montgomery hosts and narrates , in his typically pleasant manner . However , the drama's very LOUD " chorus " is so annoying , it just about turns " Harvest " into a Thanksgiving turkey .

After hanging out with bad girl Nell O'Day ( as Eve Monroe ) , Ms . Foster begins to smoke , drink , and have sex - nothing too unusual , when you consider the characters routinely being played by the likes of Bette Davis , Greta Garbo , and Mae West . But , things are worse for Foster ; she hasn't an abortionist worth his salt . . . Filmmaker Dorothy Davenport , aka the widow of Wallace Reid , might have considered casting the beloved couple's real life son Wally Jr . in the film . It might have been exploitive , but that , obviously , was too late a consideration . Despite the material , Glen Boles ( as Tommy ) , Bobby Quirk ( as Ed ) , and their gals are a swell bunch to follow ? before degradation takes its toll .

452879	15896852	52847	4.0	Gidget Gets Started	Sandra Dee gets to play the first " Gidget " ( combining " Girl and Midget " ) . She's seems too made-up and beautiful for the role , but she acts the perkiness well . James Darren has a good role with " Moondoggie " . Cliff Robertson is the " The Big Kahuna " of the beach . At different times , Ms . Dee's Gidget seems to want to : have fun , have sex , grow up , grow out , stay young , and / or learn to surf ( which is not at all unusual ) . Most of all , Gidget wants a boyfriend . This film seems much more significant in hindsight ; since , the Gidget character proved to be so enduring , and filmmakers discovered an audience for teenagers in swimsuits was ready for action . As a film , " Gidget " only fair , and its story is standard . I thought the most interesting part was Mr . Robertson's character - - do you want him to " grow up " and leave the beach , or should he become an old beach bum ? You do get an answer , at the end of the movie . Also interesting is how Robertson relates to the younger characters . The music is slight . Mr . Darren does the title song nicely ( later on ) ; and , the soundtrack often sounds like the melody to " Tammy " is about to begin .

Accompanying the singing pilot is his crop-dusting partner Gary Lockwood ( as Danny Burke ) . Along the way , they pick up cute little Vicky Tiu ( as Sue-Lin ) ; and , they agree to take her to the fair , for her uncle . Mr . Presley and Mr . Lockwood succumb to weaknesses for women and gambling , and lose little Miss Tiu . Presley sings ten songs ; he ogles shapely women , and falls for one Joan O'Brien ( as Diane Warren ) . Truly a FAIR film ; " It Happened at the World's Fair " is more disappointing in that it does , after all , star Elvis Presley , a man capable of so much more . Two of the ten new songs are worthy : " They Remind Me Too Much of You " is a strongly sung ballad ; and , " One Broken Heart for Sale " is a good , albeit medium-paced , rocker . The version of the latter song has an extra verse in the film , but the album version is punchier . Look out for future " Batgirl " Yvonne Craig ( Dorothy Johnson ) to really bust things up , in an early scene . At the fair , young Kurt Russell kicks Presley in the shins a couple times , after asking him , " Are you drunk ? " Not enough happened at the world's fair to justify the length of this movie .

A series of misunderstandings threaten their chance for romance . This film was re-made as " You Can't Run Away From It " ( 1956 ) . It does compare favorably to that version ; I think the situation works better in an older , black and white film from ten years earlier ? and , this version is a re-make of an even earlier version , " It Happened One Night " . This one , " Eve Knew Her Apples " is really just okay . Ms . Miller is pretty . The production is weak , with the editing its most obvious distraction .

Naturally , Fontaine and DeMarney find themselves becoming more and more attracted to each other .

But , it features some cute scenes , and gets funnier in the second half ; the London setting , and British cast , help . Fontaine gets to perform the musical number " It Must Be Love " . No threat to Alice Faye or Ginger Rogers , Fontaine is better with the comedy ; but , she would soon find her greatest success with drama . Everything ends up as you'd expect .

Yet , this TV movie squanders everything in its final seconds , as the title " How Awful About Allen " is reprised . It's difficult to comprehend what is being suggested ; perhaps , it was meant to stifle the previous predictability . Good cast , though . How Awful About Allan ( / 70 ) Curtis Harrington - Anthony Perkins , Julie Harris , Joan Hackett

452583	15896852	305357	4.0	Angels with Dirty Faces	The script seems more coherent , compared to the last one . . . It's comic book live action storytelling . . . The production is very much like a string of music videos . . . The worst musical interlude is something involving angels Drew Barrymore ( Dylan ) , Cameron Diaz ( Natalie ) , and Lucy Liu ( Alex ) as " Sound of Music " nuns cruising a cute priest , then playing with bird poop . . . " Bosley " becomes a noun instead of a character , with Bernie Mac taking over the role - upping the level of " broad comedy " . The original series had a more subtle wit . The Angels don't show any more than they showed in the sexier " Charlie's Angels " ( 2000 ) . But , you do have a tighter story , and some much appreciated continuity . Original angel Jaclyn Smith ( Kelly ) makes a heavenly cameo appearance , and Demi Moore ( Madison ) " returns " from an untold intervening era . She seems a little like Kate Jackson , but takes a " wrong turn " . There is quite a long span before Moore emerges as a main character - after Barrymore's villainous former boyfriend takes center stage .

While blasting away the rock to find the hidden treasure , the explorers awaken a prehistoric creature with the power of invisibility . Only the shrieking cries of the approaching monster give its victims any warning to their terrifying fate , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Dubbed " Sound of Horror " in English , this Spanish horror film doesn't make a bit of sense , if you think about the plot . But , when you consider the time , and what the production must have cost , it manages to provide a fair bang for the buck . The direction , by José Antonio Nieves Conde , is exemplary . And , you get to see Soledad Miranda ( as Maria ) and Ingrid Pitt ( as Sofia ) play pretty roommates , potential rivals , and possible monster food . El sonido de la muerte ( 1964 ) José A .

Then , Young meets lovely Lillian Gish ( as Alice Challice ) , who had been corresponding with his valet ; and , a romance blossoms . Unable to convince anyone of his true identity , Young happily marries Ms . Gish . Complications peak when the new " Mr . and Mrs . Henry Leek " are visited by the first Leek family . Dull version of the Arnold Bennett play " The Great Adventure " ( 1913 ) , which was most memorably filmed as " Holy Matrimony " ( 1943 ) . " His Double Life " is livened , however , by a rare 1930s film appearance by Gish . Though the presentation of the story is not at all convincing , Gish's performance is sincere . Her " tea party " with the original Leek family is the film's highlight . His Double Life ( 1933 ) Arthur Hopkins - Roland Young , Lillian Gish , Montagu Love

Fortunately , wealthy Harcourt is also " The Country Doctor " , and can sit by his daughter's bedside as she struggles to regain her health . Unfortunately , poor mother Kate Bruce and daughter Mary Pickford need Dr . Harcourt's services as Adele DeGarde , the girl in their family , is likewise bedridden . The good doctor is torn between his little girl and his responsibility as the town's doctor . G . W . Bitzer's Greenwich , Connecticut location footage is generous , and this film's highlight ; though , you'll wish it was better preserved . The story , dealing with a doctor's responsibility , is a good one . Both Mr . Powell and Ms . Lawrence go too far over-the-top in their portrayals this time around , however . Ms . Bruce and Ms . Pickford are more restrained , but little daughters Egan and DeGarde absolutely steal the show with their deadpan bedside manners , especially little Gladys !

Paul , who survived Nazis by becoming undead , is a vampire rights proponent . Paul is troubled by flashbacks , and has to avoid bloodlust . Mr . Woodbine has to overcome his prejudices against vampires , when he finds himself falling in love with sexy Chinese vampire Bai Ling ( as Lucy Westenra ) . Michael Oblowitz ' " The Breed " has a good supporting cast , and a stylish look ; but , the plot doesn't really dig . Most obviously , the mishmash of symbolism is confusing ; and , the movie becomes absurd . The " love story " between Woodbine and Ms . Ling has no teeth ; in fact , the shooting of a gay vampire's testicle is played as sexier . Nosferatu and Dracula are obviously referenced . And , so is horror queen Barbara Steele , who co-starred with Adrian Paul in " Dark Shadows " , as " Her name is Barbara Steele ? " introduces the film's most bloody victim .

Due to drought , a menacing cougar is on the scene , making the outdoors very dangerous for the movie's characters . . . There is a lot of fighting , with and without the cougar ; but , that's not the film's most interesting feature . More interesting is that the movie features a few " child stars " past their " Hollywood Prime . " On hand : Lon McCallister , from 1943's " Stage Door Canteen " and others , Peggy Ann Garner from 1945's " A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " and others , Skip Homeier from 1944's " Tomorrow , the World " and others , and Gene Reynolds from 1938's " Boys Town " and others .

Miles doesn't know it , but the lurking trio are planning a robbery . After Miles leaves , the thieves terrorize helpless Marion Lenard ( as Mother Cullison ) and the three Cullison girls - - Mary Pickford , Gladys Egan , and Adele DeGarde . As the burglars bust in , Ms . Leonard's uses her telephone to desperately call for help ? For its time , " The Lonely Villa " likely packed an audience pleasing punch ; but it's rather ordinary , when compared to director D . W . Griffith's later revisitations of its story / situation . The location footage is a highlight , and the cutting of the Cullisons ' telephone cord is a nice touch . Ms . Pickford , with her relatively small stature , makes a convincing little girl .

Writer / director Elmer Clifton manages to squeeze a few drops of blood from this stone . A scene between villain Philip Van Zandt ( as King Peterson ) asking " Do you mind if I smoke ? " and hero John Archer ( as Jimmy Horton ) replying " I don't care if you burn " piques interest . Mr . Clifton and H . B . Warner ( as " Mac " McVeigh ) were bigger names during the silent film era ( look for Walter Long , also ) . Mr . Archer was a fine actor , who did not get the parts he deserved ; and it shows , in this film . Teenage Gale Storm ( as Mary Phillips ) , who unexpectedly became a 1950s TV and rock ' n ' roll era recording star , is irresistibly cute ; she , and brief pair of vivacious dancing girls , give the film some much-needed oomph . In spite of some strengths , " City of Missing Girls " remains oblique and recumbent . City of Missing Girls ( 1941 ) Elmer Clifton - John Archer , H . B . Warner , Gale Storm

Rogers , if elected Sheriff , will follow in the footsteps of his Roy Rogers namesakes ( including his father and grandfather ) . However , Rogers seems meek and mild ; though a popular man , townspeople wonder if he is up to the job . This is an interesting Rogers vehicle in that the character is presented as a hero perhaps not up to the task at hand ; no points for guessing how he does , finally ! There is the expected " shootout " to end the film , but it really peaks earlier as Rogers ' car is stolen ; he gets the car back in fine form . Rogers sings with Gabby , with Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " , and with some unfortunately intrusive dialog .

Vincent Price has a go at Verne's Mad Dictator , but is done in by a wavering budget . Some of the sequences are just silly . It's also silly to see Charles Bronson aboard ; he is not used to his best advantage . Mr . Bronson might have been better as the Master Robur . I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be going on with the men dangling by that rope - a statement about bad cooking on a blimp ?

For discipline , Parmalee gives the Rangers an unenviable mission , escorting some " stinkin ' buffalo hides " out west .

Mr . Kirk's mission is to prepare Earth for an invasion of Martians . He is sent to dresser Elsa Lanchester ( as Aunt Wendy ) ' s home . Ms . Lanchester thinks young Kirk belongs on the beach . She renames him " George " , and sends him out , in tight blue trunks , to have fun in the sun . On the beach , Kirk meets Ms . Funicello , and romance ensues ? Not the best of the run , as it's missing some essentials ; but , American International's " Pajama Party " is probably the series ' sexiest entry . The cast is more often featured in swimwear than bedclothes , you should note . And , with the exception of Funicello , the cast is in their hottest beach attire . The exceptional Funicello shows off her assets in pink nightwear , during her " Stuffed Animal " song performance ; and , she gets a dance number , too . Probably due to scheduling conflicts , it appears Frankie Avalon's role was moved over to Jody McCrea ; and , Mr . Avalon appears in dubbed voice-over and cameo only . At one point , it's suggested that Kirk is borrowing Funicello boyfriend McCrea's clothes , which would have been believable with Avalon , but not the much larger McCrea . Other regulars get more to do , too , like Buster Keaton , Donna Loren , and Mike Nader . The cameos are way cool ; like " My name is Dorothy " Kilgallen as a fun motorcycle mama . While the Frankie / Annette dynamic is missing ; Kirk is a worthy substitute , and his meeting Funicello on the beach is a delight . Watch as Kirk explains how well-versed he is on Earth , mentioning , " George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Mickey Mantle , Frankie Avalon ? " and , he tells Funicello , " You have a well-rounded ? " By the film's end , his unfinished phrase can be filled in . Pajama Party ( 1964 ) Don Weis - Tommy Kirk , Annette Funicello , Buster Keaton
453526	15896852	43030	4.0	Just Say No For a Day	This film peaks near its beginning with a production number featuring Doris Day and Gene Nelson dancing with both an infinity mirrored wall and the New York skyline showing outside ( of some huge windows ) . The later production number , a blend of " No , No Nanette " and " Tea for Two " , is tellingly anti-climatic . The plot is easy - Ms . Day has to say " No " to everything for a day . But , the movie goes on and on with several songs and dances having little / nothing to do with the story . Other characters and sub-plots are thrown in ; with all the extra songs and dances , I have no trouble believing everything in this film was not in the original " No , No Nanette " . Some of it all is very good - Day and MacRae sing well , Gene Nelson dances well , and Eve Arden does her thing - but this feels more like a string of songs and scenes than a movie .

For nefarious reasons , the conquerors keep lovely Lottie for themselves , sadly separating her from departing sweetheart Moore . Must the Indian sweethearts remain forever apart ?

When she goes up a hill to fetch a pail of water , both Mr . Kirkwood and Mr . Solter want to help . Ms . Pickford shows a preference for Kirkwood , and allows him to carry her pail , which leaves the jealous Solter fuming . While Pickford does not return Kirkwood's favor either a kiss or an embrace ; still , the two men decide she's worth dying for - - and , they agree on a duel to the death ? Pickford steals the show ; her scolding of the men , and successful " reconciliation " scene is a highlight , along with the outdoor New Jersey landscape , of " The Renunciation " . Consider the possibility that Pickford's production of " fiancé " Billy Quick might be due to her character's quick thinking , after she realizes her rivals ' plan to duel .

To achieve his mission , Mr . Lord allows a criminal named Scanlon ( John Kellogg ) to escape capture by Reese ( Neville Brand ) . Instead of bringing in Scanlon , Reese takes Lord into Laredo . There , Lord briefly meets Chad ( Peter Brown ) and Joe ( William Smith ) ; and , he argues with Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) about working outside the law . Undaunted , Lord sets out to complete his mission , with Reese tracking his progress . . . This episode is an obvious " try-out " for Jack Lord as a TV series star ; and , he does have the presence and ability to carry the hour . Lord is quite good in the " western " genre ; and , his Emerson ( and Shakespeare ) quoting vigilante character is very appealing . This premise , if a " pilot " , did not become a television series . In a few years , Lord would find great TV success as police detective " Steve McGarrett " on " Hawaii Five-O " . Reese provides good " sidekick " support ; and , Lola Albright ( as Lilah ) is a strong guest star . This isn't much of a " Laredo " episode ; but , it is a fairly effective showcase for the guest star . Laredo - Above the Law ( / 66 ) Richard Benedict - Jack Lord , Neville Brand , Lola Albright

453724	15896852	71803	4.0	Lucy Hits the Wall	" You're invited to party hearty - and in fabulous style - with this lavish 1974 screen version of the beloved Broadway musical . Lucille Ball brings star sparkle to the title role , a high-living grande dame who's outlandishly eccentric and , when suddenly faced with raising an orphaned nephew , fiercely loving . Veterans of the New York stage original join her : Beatrice Arthur as best friend ' Vera ' , Jane Connell as prim governess ' Agnes ' , choreographer Onna White , and director Gene Saks . As Mame's husband ' Beauregard ' , Robert Preston sings ' Loving You ' , written specially for the film . Jerry Herman's songs , from ' It's Today ' to ' We Need a Little Christmas ' to ' If He Walked Into My Life ' , rank among the best show tunes ever . For a grand time , bring home ' Mame ' , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Let's try to be kind , since Lucy's " Mame " is all too obvious in its faults . After about an hour - if you can stay tuned ( if not , fast forward to the coach arrival of Ms . Ball and Mr . Preston at his southern plantation ) , the film gets better . Ball hilariously meets Preston's family while impersonating " Scarlet O'Hara " , goes fox-trotting on the horse " Lightning Rod " , and participates in the film's best musical production number . The choreography and performance of the title song " Mame " is breezy and breathtaking ; and , it serves as a sweet tribute to Ball , in her last feature film . These mid-movie sequences give the film a lift , and the next hour of the film is more enjoyable than the first . Still , there's no getting around the fact that the miscasting of Ball in the title role was a fatal flaw . Now , with Mae West as " Vera " and Desi Arnaz as " Beauregard " , it might have worked ?

This is a nicely performed , albeit mediocre , episode . Rhodes , Rhue , and banker Barry Kelley ( as Quinn O'Connell ) doing very well in their featured roles .

453350	15896852	956250	4.0	Promoting Israel	" The Wandering Jew " , or " The Life Story of Theodore Herzl " , is a propagandized biography of the Austrian who is considered the founder of Zionism - - the political movement which resulted in the creation of the country Israel in what was Palestine . Mr . Herzl's movement was successful , of course ; in 1948 , following World War II , the nation of Israel was returned to existence . This film clearly considers the movement to be God's will . If the restoration of Israel was divinely inspired , the film certainly isn't - - it's relatively unexciting . More interesting is the history of discrimination and persecution of the Jewish people ; countered by their determination , and vision . There are many remarkable intertitles , which seem as if they could have been written decades later . For example , one reads : " The holocaust of persecution . An era of gruesome carnage and massacre of Jews unparalleled since the persecution of the Christians by the Romans . Christendom , appalled at the fanatical barbarity ? " Father Rudolph Schildkraut ( as " The Wandering Jew " ) and son Joseph Schildkraut appear intermittently ; the younger Schildkraut went from this appearance to US stardom in " Orphans of the Storm " ( 1921 ) , and beyond . " The Wandering Jew " seems to be differ from the title character , perhaps he is a Moses type ; it's a confusing , and possibly unflattering , character . Ernst Bath staidly plays Herzl . Camera movement is minimal .

Then , Chad ( Peter Brown ) hurts his shoulder ; and , Joe ( William Smith ) is kidnapped by Shelley Morrison ( as Linda Little Trees ) and her Native American Indian gang . . . Is the " Jinx " real ? Good direction ( Paul Stanley ) , performances , and a promising storyline are stopped dead by the reappearance of Laredo's comic-relief Indians , now led by ludicrous licorice-munching " Linda Little Trees " . Ms . Morrison , to her credit , performs the part endearingly and inoffensively , however . Salmi is another a fine guest star . This is the first episode to feature Smith's " Joe " more prominently than his co-stars ; and , he plays most of the episode with his shirt off , which arouses Morrison , who ties him to a tree and proposes ! Morrison , Salmi , and Smith are worth watching for . Laredo - Jinx ( / 65 ) Paul Stanley - William Smith , Albert Salmi , Shelley Morrison

Crawford assumes the dashing Haines is a well-heeled member of the " golf set " . Will she still love him if she finds out he is poor ? Haines ' wardrobe is remarkably ill fitting in the opening scenes ; and , as a result , he rather badly tears the right sleeve of his jacket . It's quite noticeable after he enters the workplace , following the initial golfing scene . Also , watch for Haines to tap another man's derrière , very quickly , as he passes the man , after entering the shipping company . Haines and Crawford are a great screen team ; especially , their rapport is evident when he shows her how to improve her golf game - which develops into a courtship . But , overall , " Spring Fever " is fairly routine . There are a few witty title cards , and scenes . George K . Arthur ( as Eustace Tewksbury ) stands out among the fine supporting cast . Considering the situation and cast , the film is a letdown . It might have been improved by more directly involving Haines and Mr . Arthur in some more comic interplay ( on the golf course ) .

" This story takes place at the end of the fifteenth century , " we are advised . Director Antonio Margheriti and the crew give it a great look . That , an attractive cast , and the moody atmosphere can't make up for the fact that the film plays itself out very slowly , and winds up nowhere special . Barbara Steele ( as Mary / Helen Karnstein ) looks particularly stunning ; probably , she inspired the US title : " The Long Hair of Death " ( but , what a way to go ) .

Despite director / writer David Cronenberg's script , " Shivers " isn't any great shakes as a bloody erotic horror . Mr . Cronenberg shows promise , however ; and , there are at least three sexy scenes . First , you have luscious Lynn Lowry ( as Forsythe ) sexily undressing . Also , still beautiful Barbara Steele ( as Betts ) takes a bath ; and , later , engages Susan Petrie ( as Janine Tudor ) in a seductive Lesbian kiss . Other than that , the movie features more bad hair than anything else . Cronenberg could have gotten off more steam by setting the maniacal sex parasites loose in a college .

Everyone comes to the conveniently shore-situated " Jamaica Inn " , where leader Leslie Banks ( as Josh Merlyn ) and his gang hang out . Alfred Hitchcock directed this old English costume drama , before taking his work to Hollywood . So , there are some understandably well-directed moments ; and , the coastal and cave scenes are nicely done . However , " Jamaica Inn " is a poorly staged version of Daphne du Maurier's novel . The actors and director make it mildly entertaining ; but , the story does not captivate . Apparently , the cast had a contest involving outrageous eye make-up , which Mr . Laughton obviously won ( by a hair ) . Jamaica Inn ( 1939 ) Alfred Hitchcock - Charles Laughton , Maureen O'Hara , Robert Newton
453674	15896852	74829	4.0	Strangers in the Night	" A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf , based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one . Due to her past treatment by men , she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets . Falling in love with a kind man , her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs . Traumatized again by these latest events , the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Rino Di Silvestro's " La lupa mannara " begins with full frontal , writhing , moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel , who ( as Daniella Neseri ) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf . The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs . The opening " flashback " reveals her hairy ancestor was ( probably ) a lycanthropic creature . Ms . Borel is , unfortunately , not a werewolf ; she is merely a very strong lunatic . As a film , " Werewolf Woman " ( in English ) would have been better if Borel's character really was a female werewolf ; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization . But , as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go , this one is hard to beat . Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film , which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore . Dazzling Dagmar Lassander ( as Elena ) and hunky Howard Ross ( as Luca ) are good supporting players .

Kovacs is good ( unexpectedly and unfortunately , this was his last screen appearance ) . Some of the others in the cast are curiously ordinary . A hurricane gets the cast wet . Mr . Avalon is fairly successful , focusing on light comedy ; he was , at time , successfully transitioning to a movie career . On the other hand , Avalon's singing of " Opposites Attract " reveals his less successful foray into the swingin ' Sinatra arena . The song , and a version of the " Sail a Crooked Ship " title were non-hit tracks on an Avalon LP . The film's comic highlight may be Wagner's use of Hart's bra as a slingshot . It's that funny .

Bradford wants their wet encounter to remain a " one night stand " , but Christensen wants more . She goes psycho . Soon , high school life for Bradford and sweet , steady girlfriend Shiri Appleby ( as Amy Miller ) is filled with misery ? and murder . " Swimfan " is smoothly directed by John Polson , nicely photographed by Giles Nuttgens , and contains some engaging performances - but , the film is really very ordinary . The story misses opportunities to plot new ground . And , the " younger " performers are clearly too old to be in high school ( they might have tried a " community college " setting ) . The supporting cast includes Richard Burton's daughter Kate ( a very sweet lady ) , and John Ritter's son Randy ( nepotism doesn't run in the Ritter family , it gallops ) .

They are all surprised , on the plane , by hundreds of stowaway snakes . The snakes are poisonous , " hyper-aggressive " , and extremely nippy - and , they demonstrate an early preference for human sex organs . Yikes ! " Snakes on a Plane " is imaginatively titled , at least . Unfortunately , it's not as successful as something like Ron Underwood's " Tremors " . And , there is no performance like Shelley Winters ' in " The Poseidon Adventure " . The rampaging snakes simply aren't very interesting . Some of them are cute . There is excitement , and a little humor . The music , especially the opening and closing songs , is cool .

That film's " landmark " moment is one of the all-time great moments in science fiction films . The " memorial " in this new version is a science fiction failure , a cheap stunt , which makes no contextual sense . What else ? well , this film has all-talking , clean-shaved humans .

The overriding theme is not man creating artificial life , and the consequences of this action . Instead , this film is about Kenneth Branagh ( as Victor Frankenstein ) desiring Helena Bonham Carter ( as Elizabeth ) . As he is unable to consummate their relationship , the sexually frustrated Mr . Branagh goes crazy and creates a artificial , monster man .

There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the " Old Dark House " story , with the " Play within a Play " being its most interesting feature .

Eve Arden ( she's Olive ) walks away with the acting honors . Mr . Reagan doesn't portray the temptation or love very well . ; he does have a good comic scene , moving very smoothly as he hides out in the kitchen from advancing Ms . Arden ( who also has her sights on Reagan ) . Ms . Parker unevenly attempts to add some dimension to her role , with varying success ; watch how she takes a sip out of drinks to even them out ( I guess ) . Particularly , watch for the scene where Reagan has to help Parker out of her dress - and imagine what Rock Hudson and Doris Day would have done with the comic overtones obviously intended in the script . That scene serves as good review . Oh , and sometimes it looks like Reagan can't believe her hair , either ! " The Voice of the Turtle " aka " One for the Book " is worth a little look .

There is NO WAY this building is ready to be torn down . Every fixture remains in place - probably , even the soap and towels haven't been removed . The place is , also , doing rather brisk business . Mostly , director Christy Cabanne follows the Von Eltz / Shannon storyline , with drunken Irishman Bert Roach ( as Charlie Layton ) providing comic relief . Mr . Cabanne was a D . W .

Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Marty Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn't exactly " rock " .

Stern , the leading man , is supposed to be playing a young teenager ( he will be returning to high school in the fall ) . He is obviously too old , but has a goofy quality that helps make the movie's " coming-of-age " theme bearable . Stern's plaintive questions to Ms .

Russell as Pollifax is abducted quickly , and spends the entire film in DANGER - she endures prison , scales mountains , and braves the raging rapids . It all looks silly , and unrealistic . We don't get a chance to see her succeed in a few cases , getting to know the character and seeing her worth . We have no idea why the " mission " is important . Mr . McGavin only begins to help later in the film ; otherwise , he's bedridden and uninterested . A " lady sleuth " role might have been a better choice for Russell , at this point in her career . Mrs .

453109	15896852	40438	4.0	It's Water Under the Bridge	In the beautiful hills of Scotland , Lassie is a good-for-nothing collie . Afraid of water , the dog lets sheep drown . So , owner Rhys Williams ( as Milton ) trades her in , to lovable old doctor Edmund Gwenn ( as William MacLure ) . Mr . Williams ' son Tom Drake ( as Tammas Milton ) is studying doctoring with Mr . Gwenn , but his father wants him to be a farmer . Mr . Drake is courting pretty young Janet Leigh ( as Margit Mitchell ) . A colorful MGM gloss makes " Hills of Home " pleasant viewing , at times . The movie winds up far less carefully made than the initial scenic images suggest , however . It's nice to see Donald Crisp return to Lassie's supporting cast ; his scenes with Gwenn provide some Scottish accented fun . Lassie veteran Tom Drake and starlet Janet Leigh are nice , but the lack of a child co-star hurts the story . Lassie's crossing of a river's broken bridge , to save her master , it a film highlight ; though , it's difficult to accept Lassie was ever afraid of water .
452708	15896852	58105	4.0	Luke's Lagoon	Luke Halpin ( as Sandy Ricks ) is home alone when he's informed said home is going to be taken away by the state of Florida ; apparently , the state has let the land to the Ricks family , and they need it back . Mr . Halpin's father Brian Kelly ( as Porter Ricks ) is away , and mother Martha has passed away since the original " Flipper " ( 1963 ) . Halpin is majorly concerned , because losing the home means losing the shore where he lives with pet dolphin Flipper . Halpin and Flipper run away from home ; incredibly , they find an isolated island nearby , and take up residence . AND , wouldn't you know it ? - kidnappers are also nearby ; they snag a British father , and let his wife Helen Perry ( as Julia ) and daughters Pamela Franklin ( as Penny ) & Francesca Annis ( as Gwen ) drift to Halpin's island paradise . Ms . Franklin performs well as Halpin's emerging co-star . Halpin's performance is touching ; he and Flipper carry the film . With all of the newness and nuances gone , this sequel is certainly not up to the original . The story is so wildly implausible , Flipper should have shouted , " RE-WRITE ! " Just for starters , Ms . Perry and " Gwen " must have very poor vision , hearing , and critical thinking skills not to figure out about Halpin . And , the songs are awfully lush . The ending holds some excitement , if you last . Halpin is still cute - older by a few years , due to the first " Flipper " being on the shelf for a few years . Flipper is still cute , too ; and , TV father Brian Kelly is on board , replacing Chuck Connors as father Ricks .

453137	15896852	78869	4.0	That Giant Sucking Sound	" The ' U . S . S . Cygnus ' is perched precariously at the edge of a Black Hole - the vast , empty nothingness where space and time end . Anything that crosses its border enters a universe of the complete unknown . And so begins a story that only Disney's film magicians could tell . A story of robots and humanoids . Of human genius and madness . And a spectacular descent into nature's ultimate mystery - ' The Black Hole ' , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Peter Ellenshaw , Frank Phillips , and the Disney crew create some marvelous visuals , but this story is mind-numbingly dumb . It seems to be a combination of " Star Wars " ( a combination Jack Kirby and " Lost In Space " ) , " 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea " , and ( last , but not least ) " The Bible " ( ? ) . Whatever they were attempting does not work . The story is laughable , unfortunately ; at least , Roddy McDowall ( as Vincent ) and Slim Pickens ( as Bob ) manage to " save face " .

Despite their youth and beauty , the couple feels their sexual sparkplug needs recharging . Ms . Hannah reads a " How to ? " book , and introduces some bondage and candle wax into the relationship . But , after seeing sexy French sunbather Valérie Quennessen ( as Lina ) , Mr . Gallagher has a better idea ! Writer / director Randal Kleiser's " Summer Lovers " is more of a modeling than a film assignment for the three stars ; but , to their credit , they try to act , as well as look , good . The lovely location footage is adorned by acres of young , tanned skin . A generous amount of nudity is on display . Soft core rock tunes and protruding Greek sculptures attempt to pound home a point , but there isn't much going down , here . And , the leading ladies never really hook up , on-screen . It's nice to see veteran babe Barbara Rush ( as Jean Featherstone ) and former " Lucy " - extra Carole Cook ( as Barbara Foster ) give the storyline a kick the pants , when they discover the ménage à trois . Ms . Rush and Ms . Cook are always an asset . Hans van Tongeren , who was a promising young actor , has a good supporting role ( as Jan Tolin ) ; sadly , he committed suicide around the time this film was released . These interesting asides don't make the film anything greater than lightweight fluff , however . Summer Lovers ( 1982 ) Randal Kleiser - Peter Gallagher , Daryl Hannah , Valérie Quennessen

What she and the rest of the public don't know is that Stephen Hawke is leading a double life . At night , he becomes ' The Spine Breaker ' , a notorious killer with the habit of viciously killing his victims in the most horrible ways imaginable , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Silly movie , enriched as much as possible by two under-appreciated British stars - murderous Tod Slaughter ( as Stephen Hawke ) and Shakespearian Eric Portman ( as Matthew Trimble ) - both deserving better productions .

The film begins promising - you expect a great interwoven , mysterious plot ; but , it doesn't really work out that way . Instead , it's an extended TV crime drama , with stuff that may have been a little too sexy and violent for the time ( so , couldn't they have put SOME bruise make-up on the blind woman ? ) . The title " Down Three Dark Streets " refers to three seemingly unrelated crimes Mr . Broderick's F . B . I . solves . It seems like you need a notepad to keep track of events , but you'll get along by paying attention to the extortion plot involving Ms . Roman . Performance-wise , it's Roman's film . There are a lot of recognizable faces , though . Martha Hyer gives a Marilyn Monroe-type performance , as directed ( Arnold Laven ) . Other than that , there are some Los Angeles-area location scenes that are very nice to see ; the location scenery is the movie's highlight - climaxing by the " HOLLYWOOD sign " .

452746	15896852	25531	4.0	Cheap Freak Show	Enterprising " Times Herald " reporter John Harron ( as Jerry Ross ) investigates " The Murder in the Museum " of a city councilman . This " Museum " isn't what you may be expecting ; although there appear to be a few paintings on display , it's really a traveling freak show - " The World's Largest Collection of Natural and Unnatural Wonders " . Among the attractions : an armless man , a bodiless woman , and the mysterious Henry B . Walthall ( as " Professor Mysto " aka Bernard Latham Wayne ) . Patrons seem more interested in scantily-clad dancing women ; unfortunately , they are told to keep it " tame it down plenty " when " the law " is spotted . The " Sphere Museum " is also a front for drug-runners ( which has attracted police and politicians ) . Just before the murder , Mr . Harron meets shapely blonde Phyllis Barrington ( as Lois Brandon ) ; and , the two fall in love . Mr . Walthall is appropriately mystic ; his casting , alongside the brother of frequent co-star Robert Harron , is inspired . Unfortunately , this production is very poor . The cast and crew manage to get through the picture smoothly enough , considering the obvious lack of rehearsals and re-takes .

452386	15896852	287730	4.0	Flesh and Blood	Undercover New York police officers Eric Roberts ( as Kit Adrian ) and Romano Orzari ( as Jay Flowers ) go up against a ruthless Russian mafia , pretending to work for bleached-blond crime lord Shawn Doyle ( as Anton Seaberg ) . Mr . Roberts invites even more danger by sleeping with the enemy's estranged wife , luscious Lucie Laurier ( as Lena ) . This film's obvious intent is to bring female flesh and human blood to the home box office crowd , without resorting to anything hard-core . The female flesh is real , and the human blood is fake . On a cheap blood and guts level , " Stiletto Dance " is successful . Mr . Orzari and Yaphet Kotto ( as Captain Sands ) provide star Roberts with solid support . But , it's really Mr . Doyle's characterization of the temperamental bad guy , who keeps it moving . Stiletto Dance ( 2001 ) Mario Azzopardi - Eric Roberts , Shawn Doyle , Romano Orzari
453184	15896852	3471	4.0	Sold Out	The head of a common New York family , Jane Gail ( as Mary Barton ) , works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin ( as Loma Barton ) at " Smyrner's Candy Store " . After Ms . Grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves , Ms . Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore ( as Larry Burke ) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman . " Traffic in Souls " has a reputation that is difficult to support - it isn't remarkably well done , and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's " virtue " threatened by sex traders . Perhaps , it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length ( claimed to have been ten reels , originally ) . The New York City location scenes are the main attraction , after all these years . The panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable , because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move .

" It's either an MBA from Harvard or you're flipping burgers . " So , after some partying , two of them decide to kill the third , and make it look like a suicide . The reason being the " standard practice " of giving traumatized roommates of suicide victims an automatic 4 . 0 grade point average for the semester . The three dudes are : psycho Matthew Lillard ( as Tim ) , impotent Michael Vartan ( as Chris ) , and contemptible Randall Batinkoff ( as Rand ) . Their pretty blonde girlfriends , fickle Keri Russell ( as Emma ) and possibly pregnant Tamara Craig Thomas ( as Natalie ) , are also roommates . Debuting director Dan Rosen's " Dead Man's Curve " characters definitely need a college shrink ; and , this is the job filled by nicotine-addicted Dana Delany ( as Dr . Ashley ) . The story , especially during the last act , needs some doctoring , too . Re-titled " The Curve " , it has noting to do with the Jan & Dean's death drag classic played over the closing credits .

After his wife becomes the mistress of Noble Grandon , Walthall contemplates suicide ; however , he is saved by a convenient priest . So , when the French Revolution begins , Walthall becomes one of its leaders , revolting against the aristocratic tyranny represented by those like the Nobleman who stole his wife . Soon , Walthall and his revolutionaries reach Barker and Grandon - - what terrible revenge might Walthall seek ? In this " Story of the French Revolution " , from director D . W . Griffith , New Jersey is dressed up as France , for an exciting outdoorsy finish . Walthall , in bushy eyebrows , excels ; note how he smells a garment near the end , to confirm his wife's presence . As a story , " The Oath and the Man " fails to suspend a great amount of disbelief .
453327	15896852	55623	4.0	Thank God I'm a Country Boy	Elvis Presley plays a troubled young " country boy " who faces The Law after administering a deadly punch . He receives parole ; then , the court has him move in with his uncle , and attend counseling sessions . There are three women who incur Elvis ' attentions - Hope Lange is the " sophisticated " psychiatrist , Tuesday Weld is the " sexy " cousin , and Millie Perkins is the " nice " girl . The story's structure is much like " Jailhouse Rock " . It differs from that film in that Elvis more prowess as a actor than a singer . What hurts the film is a plodding story which becomes to hard to understand . It seems to be about the difference in societal classes . The religious imagery gets very heavy when , during a " flood " , people march into a motel " two by two " with Elvis quoting the Bible . Elvis ' status as an undiscovered writer is made believable during a scene where the script give him some imaginative dialog , which he delivers well . Eventually , the film turns into a soap opera - more contrived than authentic . A couple of songs are nice , but they add nothing to the story .

Woodbury rooms with understanding songstress Linda Ware ( as Donna Andrews ) , who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer ( as Bob Elliott ) and Jack La Rue ( as Mickey Roman ) . But , none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam , which lands her in prison . Upon release , Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money ? Re-titled " Gangs , Inc . " , this is an obviously weak , cheap mobster melodrama . Still , it's a lot of fun to watch Woodbury work wonders with inferior material . She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated " Rita " quite convincingly ; and , she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker . Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past . " Paper Bullets " also features an early Alan Ladd ( as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan ) . Ms . Ware , who sang the hit " An Apple for the Teacher " with Bing Crosby , sings a couple of fair ' 40s numbers nicely . But , mainly , it's Woodbury's show .

She has a past , which comes back to haunt . . . she was involved with Victor Mature and a bunch of gangsters . Bennett desires the son in the house she tends , and he is a reporter working on a crime which begins to involve Bennett's past life .

Whitehall ) . The ruse , which started innocently , goes too far , and threatens Mr . Vallee's budding relationship with Ms . Dressler's niece , Sally Blane ( as Jean Whitehall ) . It all works out while Vallee sings several songs , including " I'm Just a Vagabond Lover " and " A Little Kiss Each Morning ( A Little Kiss Each Night ) " . " The Vagabond Lover " does not capture the Vallee hysteria , unfortunately . It is his first feature length film . The songs are stylistically representative , but dull ; " Honey " had already appeared in a " short " , and the film was completed too early for " The Stein Song " to be included . Ms . Blane ( Loretta Young's sister ) is very pretty ; but , the most beautiful woman in the film is most definitely Dressler . It is her first feature length sound film . Later , Vallee would become a surprisingly effective ( considering this performance ) character actor . The Vagabond Lover ( 1929 ) Marshall Neilan - Rudy Vallee , Sally Blane , Marie Dressler

I regard the prisoners here as my children , naughty children it is true , who have to be punished , " Slaughter explains , " It hurts me more than it hurts them .

Arthur dons western Tom Mix-type clothing to appear more manly , but Ms . Olmstead is unimpressed . Arthur suspicions that Mr . D'Algy is really a criminal bootlegger are proved to be correct ; and , Arthur must rescue Olmstead from D'Algy's clutches ? Though he is a likable character , this is a dated-to-the-point-of-unfunny comedy feature for Arthur . Most unfunny is Charles Murray ( as Cactus Jim ) ' s running gag about hiding his endless supply of booze - - helped , no doubt , by bootleggers . Joan Crawford ( as Jane ) lifts spirits considerably , with her turn as a crack revenue agent ; and , D'Algy is a good kisser . " The Boob " is more of a curiosity than a comedy ; and , it's a chance to see some silent performers in well-preserved celluloid .

To complicate things even further , a real escaped gorilla shows up to befuddle our trio of detectives , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Another in the long line of comedy in the haunted house capers , " The Gorilla " works well if you're familiar with the Ritz Brothers , and unfamiliar with the often filmed storyline . It will also help if you like movies featuring men in gorilla suits . Director Allan Dwan and photographer Edward Cronjager make it look all right . The cast is strengthened by a high-key performance from literary maid Patsy Kelly ( as Kitty ) , and a low-key play by butler Bela Lugosi ( as Peters ) ; their names , " Kitty " and " Peters " , are certainly amusing .

He is finally fired , for getting the story wrong , but more murders may prove Reagan right , after all ? Reagan , who doesn't always dominate the films he is advertised as the " star " of , really lives up to his top billing , this time around . A . Edward Sutherland's " Nine Lives Are Not Enough " is an intermittently bright and funny comic murder mystery , with Reagan showing promise as a light comic ; he is the movie's main asset , maintaining interest throughout an unfortunately fair feature . After this appearance , Ms . Perry took herself out of cinema circulation , for marriage with Harry Cohn . Nine Lives Are Not Enough ( 1941 ) A .

As punishment , God periodically orders Helge Nissen ( as Satan ) to " ' Continue thy evil doings ! ' " And , director Carl Theodor Dreyer traces the Evil One's deeds through the ages . The film concentrates on three historically set studies : the crucifixion of Christ , the Spanish Inquisition , and the French Revolution ; with the fourth , and last , leaf in Satan's book the ( then ) contemporary Russian invasion / occupation of Finland . Dreyer is clearly inspired by D . W . Griffith's infinitely superior , and highly recommended , " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) .

Both wind up hustling , on Santa Monica Boulevard . Since Mr . Arquette arrived first , he has taught Mr . Haas the tricks of the trade , beginning with the most important dating question : " Are you a cop ? " This is a shorter version than the one posed by Arquette ; but , it's quick , effective , and easier for the trick to understand . Hass falls in love with Arquette , and wants to take him to " Camelot " , where the two would be lifeguards . But , Arquette is reluctant to go ; he wants to spend his Birthday in an expensive hotel room . Scott Silver's " Johns " has a very realistic set-up ; the unrequited love between the two young men , and their reasons for being where they are , certainly ring true . But , the film's premise becomes a tired , unrealistic cliché . If tricks were as bad as they are herein , the Boulevard would be deserted . The actors play their parts well ; they , and Mr . Silver , make you care about them as individuals , and wish for a happy culmination . The conclusion offered by Silver is as predictable as the sunset ; however , it is infinitely less satisfying ( and leaves a bad taste in your mouth ) . On the other hand , Silver has some good moves , and is able to assemble quite a good cast and crew , for a first directorial effort . Among the supporting players , Richard Kind's beautiful portrayal of an understanding hotel clerk is most outstanding . Even the other hotel customers seemed enchanted . There is a lot of Christian religiosity ? this is , arguably , a re-telling of the so-called " greatest story ever told " . Don't miss that Christ-like , barefoot Arquette's " John " is given a " crown of thorns " . And , also note that Haas ' deerly named " Donner " has a Judas-like moment . And , remember , Haas told Arquette he doesn't celebrate Christmas because , " I'm Jewish . " Great , Scott . What's the message ?

An eclectic cast makes this " old dark house " variation fairly entertaining , albeit structurally flawed . The leading man and woman are " store detectives " Wallace Ford ( as Jimmy Kelly ) and Barbara Pepper ( as Marjorie Burns ) . But , the real treat is seeing former silent film superstar Clara Kimball Young ( as Mrs . Jamison ) , in one of her more meaty later year roles . The matronly Ms .

It starts out a little like " Beach Party " - of-the-absurd , and moves to a reverse - " From Here to Eternity " , then muddles around . It ends with the " Big Battle . " There are some well-staged dramatic scenes ( Otto Preminger directed ) and some nice photography . It's nice to see Mr . Wayne with an age appropriate looking feminine interest in Ms . Neal , who lifts the film quite a bit with her presence . It's interesting to see Kirk Douglas ' and Mr . De Wilde's relative unsympathetic characterizations , which made me wonder about the filmmakers ' motives . Strange film , but admittedly star-studded , and worth a look .

Soon , there are junkies among the cast ? This is a relatively highly entertaining early D . W . Griffith film , as it deals with the cocaine addiction . It was , likely , a topical film subject for Griffith ; in the past , the drug was legal ; and , it was once rumored to have been included among Coca-Cola's " secret ingredients . " Otherwise , the film is a morality play - - note that the father is aware of the danger in Dopokoke ; and , he uses the drug for selfish reasons , which come back to haunt him . Ms . Bernard gives the stand-out performance , as the father's secretary . For His Son ( 1912 ) D . W . Griffith - Charles Hill Mailes , Charles West , Dorothy Bernard
453482	15896852	684889	5.0	Steele Away with Lara Parker	Remington ( Pierce Brosnan ) and Laura ( Stephanie Zimbalist ) go undercover to investigate intellectual theft , in the world of high fashion design . Not surprisingly , the investigation involves murder . Although the delightful Doris Roberts does not appear in this episode , the great guest cast helps fill the void . Joshua Shelley ( as Bulletz Bloustein ) and Dean Santoro ( as Julian Baron ) are the well-cast bickering brothers of fashion . Carl Weintraub ( as Karl ) is an appropriately nasty foil . Remington and Laura have a couple of their finer moments ; Bronson is especially noteworthy , giving sweat-panted Zimbalist a foot massage , and expressing great emotion when he thinks his partner has expired . And , best of all is beautiful featured Lara Parker ( as Lila Colbert ) . Ms . Parker has one of her major guest-starring roles ; once again , she shows enough performance ability to have been starred in her own television series .

Robinson try to tickle her fancy , she prefers Wilfred Lucas ( as Jack ) . After the two flirt , Ms . Bernard receives word that a $2 , 000 payroll will be arriving by train , and placed in her trust . This attracts some bad elements ; specifically , tramps Edwin August and Alfred Paget ; they are plotting steal the $2 , 000 . . . Director D . W . Griffith's " cross-cutting " makes " A Girl and Her Trust " an exciting early silent , improving on the his earlier " The Lonely Villa " ( 1909 ) ; however , the story situation is not nearly as good as the forthcoming " An Unseen Enemy " ( 1912 ) , with the Gish sisters , which also improves on " The Lonedale Operator " , which this film is practically a re-make of . . . Bernard performs very well as the heroine ; Mr . Lucas steals both her heart , and co-acting honors . Griffith's cast of " extras " is always extraordinary . Though memorable , the way Bernard uses : a bullet , a keyhole , and scissors as a gun may have you shaking your head .

After the woman is unsuccessful in convincing her husband of what she saw , the psychiatrist approaches him and says she needs psychiatric treatment , and she should be placed under his care , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . He never really cuts loose , in this early starring appearance , but Vincent Price ( as Richard Cross ) is certainly one of the film's main assets . Lovely Lynn Bari ( as Elaine Jordan ) is the woman he tries to to please , by killing .

452791	15896852	17519	5.0	William Boyd Loves a White Russian	William Boyd ( as Feodor ) is a Volga river boatman " whose broad breast and ringing voice never tired because he dreamed a dream of freedom . " Elinor Fair ( as Princess Vera ) is " in that delightful feminine state of intending to say ' yes ' but acting ' no ' " to Victor Varconi ( as Prince Dimitri Orloff ) , " an Officer of the Czar's Guard " who is " just a man waiting for a woman's ' yes ' or ' no ' . " Ms . Fair and Mr . Varconi become engaged , but the Princess falls in love with the un-Princely Mr . Boyd . Their entanglements are played out against the Russian Revolution . Nice looking film by Cecil B . DeMille , J . Peverell Marley , and others . The performances begin well ; especially future " Hopalong Cassidy " star Boyd - in his scene meeting Fair and Varconi , Boyd intensely shows anger , lust , and disgust . Unfortunately , the film peaks there . If you make it through the running time , you should watch for the scene when Boyd gives Fair five minutes say her prayers , before he means to kill her - she rips her dress a little to mark her upper chest with an " X " for his targeting convenience ! There are some additional titillating strip scenes ( which don't titillate , by the way ) . " The Volga Boatman " is as slow moving and predictable as its protagonist . Theodore Kosloff , Julia Faye , and Robert Edeson try to liven things up among the Red Russians . White Russian Varconi makes a wise decision at the end . Off-screen , Boyd and Fair would marry ; surprisingly , there is noting very extraordinary about their on-screen romance - they look better with Faye and Varconi . . .

453185	15896852	108915	5.0	Long with the Wind	This very long sequel to " Gone with the Wind " is an EPIC disappointment . What the storyline is will vary from viewer to viewer - my take is that it started with the funeral of " Melanie Hamilton " ( unseen ) , proceeded with the death of " Mammy " ( Esther Rolle ) , and meandered around until " Scarlett O'Hara " ( Joanne Whalley ) found her " Roots " . She does this by going to Ireland , and stands in some Stonehenge type rubble , which is the original " Tara " . If you don't know what " Tara " is , you probably shouldn't be watching this one . As in Margaret Mitchell's original story , " Rhett Butler " ( Timothy Dalton ) pops in and out of Scarlett's life . Neither Ms . Whalley nor Mr . Dalton are very impressive , and the script doesn't help them very much ; since the " Rhett " character is ( and always was ) more secondary , Whalley fares worse . In lesser roles , other actors have good moments . Probably , the best performance arrives later in the running time - with Sean Bean's wicked " Lord Richard Fenton " . When Mr . Bean takes the screen , he TAKES the screen - he will wake you up . " Fenton " is purely evil , and may not belong in Margaret Mitchell's cast of characters , but at least Bean brings some passion to the proceedings . The original book and film were full of PASSION , and this follow-up has so very little ? The sets , costumes , and locations are extremely beautiful , though ?

452668	15896852	87932	5.0	Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite Eric !	Mickey Rourke ( he's Charlie ) and Eric Roberts ( he's Paulie ) play a pair of poor Italian restaurant workers fired when the latter is caught stealing . Daryl Hanna is around to attract the lecherous glances . Geraldine Page and Kenneth McMillan are around to attract the awards conscious . Most obvious is the performance of Mr . Roberts - possibly , the movie fails because he puts more into his character than he puts into the key relationship with Mr . Rourke's character ; for whatever reasons , Roberts steals the all the attention . Even when Rourke hysterically trashes his home , it's because of Roberts more than anything ( in your mind's eye ) . Roberts adds some interesting bits to his character - the hair , the accent , the thing he does with his tongue . . . he is quite memorable . But , the film's main character , if you had to pick one , is supposed to be Rourke . That character doesn't work , either . The Italian gang led by the " Bed Bug " makes it a " dangerous crime comedy " when it isn't a " serious buddy film " . There is a story - a Roberts scheme to rob a safe peaks about mid-film ; it is well done , and involves Ms . Page's winning performance of a cop's mother . Though exciting , you'll find little blood ( even in a gruesome scene ) . An interesting , albeit failed , character study from director Stuart Rosenberg .

452856	15896852	32717	5.0	Big Moo	This one compares relatively well with the other old " Little Women " and " Little Men " movies . It boasts an evenly keeled performance from Jimmy Lydon ( as Danny ) , who handles the material particularly well . Other Louisa May Alcott adaptations err by casting older , and far too cutely made-up , stars as Alcott's young characters . Possibly , due to his relative youth , Mr . Lydon gets less than " star billing " . Higher-billed veterans Kay Francis ( as Jo March ) and George Bancroft ( as Major Burdle ) provide strong adult support . Ms . Francis ' portrayal of an older " Jo " rings true . However , Jack Oakie ( as Willie the Fox ) has the most enjoyable role . In black-and-white , Nick Musuraca photographs Darrell Silvera's sets quite nicely . Still , the total effect sometimes too cute for comfort . Little Men ( 1940 ) Norman Z .

453045	15896852	63049	5.0	Hey , Hey ! They're the Monkees - Can You Dig It ?	Micky Dolenz , Davy Jones , Peter Tork , and Mike Nesmith star as the " The Monkees " , a manufactured pop / rock group trapped in commercialism . Albeit with some serious lapses in development , this film follows the same characterizations offered in the TV series " The Monkees " . Bob Rafelson and The Monkees continue with themes and surrealistic elements used in the TV show . Interestingly , " Head " closely follows the television series ' finial episodes , which are a primer for their " career-ending " film . New pal Jack Nicholson , coming off " Psych-Out " , jumps aboard The Monkees ' ship , for its final visual trip . This is a surprisingly well-structured film , given my expectations . The Monkees are trapped in " The Box " ( television ) ; despite some valiant attempts , they are unable to break free . The ending , if you're able to focus , does cohesively wrap-up the seemingly ( but not , really ) disjointed events . You'll need to watch the closing scenes carefully , to pick up the references to earlier sequences . My favorite is Mr . Dolenz discovering an empty Coca-Cola machine in the dessert ; later , it will be shot to pieces . Also enjoyable are Mr . Tork's scenes with the transvestite waiter . Tork's acting performance ( if that even matters ) is good ; he always does well in the more psychedelic Monkey situations . ( Imagine Tork playing in this film with Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , and Groucho Marx ! ) Annette Funicello is terrific in a small supporting role , and Frank Zappa enjoyable in a cameo . The problem with " Head " is that it does not celebrate the emerging individual personalities of the Monkees as a replacement for their imprisoned group persona . Nor does it display much of the humorous camaraderie which made the actors ' TV show so much fun . It lacks respect . Probably , at the time , no one recognized that this was either necessary , or could be done . Head ( 1968 ) Bob Rafelson - Micky Dolenz , Peter Tork , Davy Jones

Naturally , Ms . Wong is compelled to continue her father's murderous ways ; mainly , she wants to torture and kill members of the British Petrie family ( as in previous Fu films ) . Meanwhile , good detective Sessue Hayakawa ( as Ah Kee ) has tracked the Gang of Fu to London . The triumph of good over evil hits the expected snag when Mr . Hayakawa becomes attracted to his prey . Will the hunter get captured by the game ? Lloyd Corrigan's " Daughter of the Dragon " is far from the best " Fu " . It is the last appearance of Mr . Oland as the famous villain ; and , he is most effective , in his abbreviated appearance . The idea to cast Wong and Hayakawa was a good one ; however , their portrayals are clownish . Hayakawa , an otherwise fine actor , is obviously working on articulation . Victor Milner's photography is the film's main strength . Harold Minjir's comic relief role , as the nearsighted " Rogers " , is also quite good . The story moves along briskly enough to overcome some absurdities .

453026	15896852	15145	5.0	Taking a Powder	Rudolph Valentino ( as Philippe , aka the " Duke de Chartres " ) is a member of France's 18th century powder set ; he and royal cousin Bebe Daniels ( as Princess Henriette ) are quite a pair , but etiquette gets in the way . So , Mr . Valentino leaves the court of Lowell Sherman ( as King Louis XV ) and Lois Wilson ( as Queen Marie ) ; and , he relocates to Bath , England . There , he assumes the identity of ordinary barber " Monsieur Beaucaire " . Valentino enjoys life as a commoner ; nonetheless , he quickly assumes the role of a French nobleman , in order to romance Doris Kenyon ( as Lady Mary ) . Eventually , he realizes there's no place like home ? After a two year strike , Rudolph Valentino made " Monsieur Beaucaire " his comeback film . It's an elaborate , confusing , and mannered production . Nevertheless , in Valentino's case , absence did make the hearts of America grow fonder ; and , Valentino spent the next two years as the USA's top male Box Office Star . Probably , the position was enhanced due to the continued circulation of the star's previous hits . " Monsieur Beaucaire " is a valiant failure . Staid , light and shadow direction by Sidney Olcott , daintily made-up and costumed players , and elaborately designed scenes are featured . The story of a royal assuming the commoner's role is interesting ; but , despite the title , Valentino is only briefly seen in the entertaining role of barber . Possibly , the film's focus was lost during the making . One of Valentino's 1923 song recordings was added to the soundtrack ; listen for it when the star sings a serenade , near the film's beginning . A record wasn't released until later , but the song is chronologically correct , herein ; thematically , the Valentino recordings more closely fit other films , however . This recording , and Valentino's successful American tour , suggested a Garbo-like success in talking films was possible , had Valentino lived into the sound era .

They join mates William " Billy " Benedict ( as Skinny ) , David " Dave " Durand ( as Dave aka Danny ) , Bobby Stone ( as Rocky ) , Jimmy Strand ( as Lou aka Pinkie ) , and Buddy " Bud " Gorman ( as Stinkie aka Slug ) to save millionaire Herbert Hayes ( as John H .

For kicks , Johnny Duncan ( as Roy Cortland ) aka the " Million Dollar Kid " hangs out in pool halls with derelicts like Gabriel Dell ( as Lefty ) . Moreover , young Duncan's pretty sister , Louise Currie ( as Louise Cortland ) , may be engaged to a gangster . Out of respect and admiration for the older millionaire , Gorcey and pals decide they must reform young Duncan , and investigate his sister's French fiancé . This one is predictable , but fun . The subtle , satirical humor works very well - it starts with Gorcey quizzing club applicant " Herbie " about his age ( obviously more than two times 14 years old ) and reaches a peak as Gorcey has a great " bit " with his ( real ) father , playing a short messenger with a chip on his shoulder . It's also nice to see Duncan featured ; he becomes an official " East Side Kid " herein , and will play " Robin " in the 1949 " Batman " series .

Hamilton's surprisingly prejudiced guardian refuses to bless the union . Despite featuring two of the biggest stars of the silent era , Talmadge and Meighan , and a very capable director , Sidney Franklin , " The Forbidden City " fails to make too much of an impression . The locales and sets are nice , especially during the early scenes . The moon is an appropriate eternal image . Talmadge's prayer to Buddha , and declaration " I American - I no need ancestors ! " make the film more amusing than dramatic . The Forbidden City ( / 18 ) Sidney Franklin - Norma Talmadge , Thomas Meighan , Reed Hamilton
452780	15896852	41594	5.0	Close , but No Whistle	A miscast " Little Women " , with a lot of expensive sets and photography ; colorful and overproduced . Margaret O'Brien is the best of the bunch ; she can actually play a " Little Woman " believably . " Christopher Columbus ! " but , June Allyson looks and sounds ghastly in this role ; the " older woman cast as young girl " thing worked much better in silents , with fuzzy B & W photography . Peter Lawford's tutor looks as young as his character . And , my grandmother said , " If I ever came to the breakfast table with the make-up Elizabeth Taylor has on , I'd have gotten a licking ! " They age into their roles with varying success , if you keep watching . In my opinion , this movie will appeal mostly to followers of lavish period productions , or fans of a specific individual / filmmaker . I don't see how 1949's " Little Women " could be better than either the original book or another filmed version . And , why wasn't there room in the budget to dub in a decent " whistle " for Ms . Allyson ? Little Women ( 1949 ) Mervyn LeRoy - June Allyson , Margaret O'Brien , Elizabeth Taylor

While Mr . Davis spies on a nearby yacht party , Mr . Rambo goes scuba diving . Rambo surfaces without treasure , and the two watch jet-setters arrive at the party via helicopter . The men are shocked when a beautiful woman drops from the helicopter and disappears into the ocean . While Rambo goes underwater to look for her , Davis is nearly killed by a ship helmed by sinister Ray Milland ( as Evelyn Rose ) . Soon , Mr . Milland fishes both men out of the water . Milland is somehow connected to the lost lady , and wants Davis and Rambo to stop searching . The duo manage to escape Milland's clutches with a clue - the missing woman's compact . This leads them to widow Suzanne Pleshette ( as Anna ) , who was married to the lover of the missing woman . Davis falls in love with Pleshette , which irks Milland crew member Jorge Luke ( as Tomas ) . And , Rambo becomes obsessed with finding the woman they saw disappear into the ocean ? Rambo and Davis keep it going , but this high-rated " ABC Movie of the Week " doesn't end up being very compelling . Although they are higher billed , Milland and Pleshette are supporting players . Milland had just had a late career peak in " Love Story " and Pleshette would soon hook up with Bob Newhart . Rambo was coming off " The Guns of Will Sonnett " and Davis was in between " Dark Shadows " and " Alias Smith and Jones " . All very likable performers . Watch for Rambo to call Pedro Armendáriz Jr . ( as Angel ) by his real name , and be corrected - the two actors handle the name confusion smoothly . River of Gold ( / 71 ) David Friedkin - Dack Rambo , Roger Davis , Ray Milland
452417	15896852	4113	5.0	Be It Ever So Humble	D . W . Griffith's allegorical study of John Howard Payne , who composed the heart-tugging standard " Home , Sweet Home " . The director presents the drama in four parts : In " Part I . ( Prologue ) " , Henry B . Walthall ( as Payne ) leaves home to make his fortune in the big city , leaving Lillian Gish to pine away at home , with his mother . Mr . Walthall succumbs to a decadent lifestyle ( he becomes an actor ! ) ; and , he never returns home to find true happiness with Ms . Gish . Unfortunately , there is no East Hampton location footage featuring " Payne House " ; which would have been lovely to see , as I am a resident . Walthall and Gish are typically up for the task , in this pivotal episode . Josephine Crowell and Fay Tincher offer support ( from opposite sides of the fence ) . In " Part II . ( First Episode ) " , Robert Harron ( as Robert " Bob " Winthrop ) has better luck as " a fortune seeking youth from the east " who falls for country girl Mae Marsh ( as " Apple Pie " Mary ) . Though tempted to return to his Eastern lifestyle , Harron finally comes to his senses , after hearing " Home , Sweet Home " . This is the best " Episode " of the film , with Harron and Ms . Marsh proving a very pleasant pair . Marsh is especially memorable ; with a cute , lighter characterization than her illustrious co-actresses . Spottiswoode Aiken and Walter Long ( as Alkali Pete ) lend their support . In " Part III . ( Second Episode ) " , Jack Pickford gives mother Mary Alden a will to live after hateful brothers Donald Crisp and James Kirkwood shoot each other to death . Structurally and thematically , this is the weakest link in the overall story . Unlike the other episodes , there is a good deal of outdoor location footage ; highlighted by seacoast scenes , and Pickford's " The brothers are fighting , the brothers are fighting ! " warning ride . Fred Burns lends support , as the sheriff Pickford idolizes . This may have been intended as an individual film , praising good dullness over wicked excitement . In " Part IV . ( Third Episode ) : ' The Marriage of Roses and Lilies ' " , Blanche Sweet is tempted to carnally engage suave Owen Moore , but returns to the arms of sleepy Courtenay Foote , after hearing " Home , Sweet Home . " Here , the drama returns more solidly to the power of the song to change one's direction , in the face of temptation . Happily reversing the earlier episodes , the woman is the character tempted ; although , Ms . Sweet's looks more like innocent flirtation . Edward Dillon lends stalwart support . In " Epilogue " , Walthall is in Hell , or being pulled there by his lustful life . Gish , now an angel in Heaven , flies around , searching for her earthly beloved . Finally , in Gish's loving arms , Walthall ascends . Overall , " Home , Sweet Home " suggests Payne received salvation , in the afterlife , through the everlasting power of his song . Griffith's patchwork storytelling would significantly improve , in a couple of years ? Home , Sweet Home ( / 14 ) D . W . Griffith - Henry B . Walthall , Lillian Gish , Mae Marsh

Cecil Kellaway ( as Geoffrey ) and Hilda Vaughn ( as Mary ) are , of course , excellent , as the actual pair's servants . Mr . Brisbane has a great part ; and , he gets to sing . The story is mostly fair , with a few good moments . Fontaine's milk truck attack on the runaway couple's pursuers shouldn't be missed . The ending " double take " of kisses ends the film on a sweet note . Maid's Night Out ( 1938 ) Ben Holmes - Allan Lane , Joan Fontaine , William Brisbane

Odin's troubled friend Hugo ( Josh Hartnett ) , the coach's son is deeply resentful of his father's preference of Odin on and off the court . When Hugo plots a diabolical scheme to sow the seeds of mistrust between ' O ' and Desi , it sets in motion a disturbing chain of events which erupts into a firestorm of breathtaking intensity . ' O ' is a stunning tale that will stay with you long after its final , powerful frame , " according to the promotional synopsis . And , like it promises : " O " features , " Hot young stars , a hip , driving soundtrack , plus a provocative tale of jealousy and betrayal combine to create this controversial modern-day version of Shakespeare's classic , ' Othello . ' " The Shakespearian plot is still good , after all these centuries . But , the transference of these events to a " high school " setting doesn't work . As a whole , the actors do not look or act between 14-18 years old ; at one point , Mr . James says they're eighteen ( a wise age to pick , from range available ) . Granted , with retention and steroids , many athletes look much older , presently - still , " O " doesn't balance this with age appropriate casting ( or behavior ) . Making the age matter worse is a script which really doesn't really ring true . This story , with its controversy likely related to violent real-life teenage mass murderers , doesn't possess the degree of teen angst and alienation necessary to bring that slant to the tale . And , it doesn't fit the " Othello " plot . The cast and direction are very good , though ? why didn't somebody suggest a college setting ?

From there , director Mick Garris moves the action to Travis , Indiana . . . We are introduced to shirtless hunk Brian Krause ( as Charles Brady ) and his still hot mother Alice Krige ( as Mary Brady ) . They are obviously a nostalgic duo , evidenced by their slow dancing to Santo & Johnny's 1959 hit " Sleep Walk " . A likely choice . Anyway , the son and mother are also lovers . But , Mr . Krause needs to suck the life force out of a virgin female to satisfy Ms . Krige , who is " famished " . Krause is too old for high school , but he attends anyway ; and , after rebuffing his gay teacher , he decides to hook up with implausible virgin Mädchen Amick ( as Tanya Robertson ) . Horror novelist King and some others appear in small roles . Together , Ms . Amick and Krause look a little like older versions of Brook Shields and Christopher Atkins . Hmmm .

Day is trying too hard in this movie , losing the naturalness which charmed her " Romance on the High Seas " debut . This film's salvation is the slew of " cameo " appearances - - Joan Crawford and Edward G . Robinson are very good .

Ann Sheridan ( as Peggy ) is Danny's childhood girlfriend - she gives up their romance for a dancing career , and ends up weeping profusely for it . The film begins as the " City for Conquest " characters are children , living in New York city's lower East Side . Each child mirrors his / her adult development ; for example , " Danny " fights , " Peggy " dances , and " Eddie " squeezes his music box . These opening scenes are well-done , and effectively introduce the characters . However , the switch from children to adult actors fails because the " Danny " boy is so unlike actor James Cagney - it's very startling when Cagney appears . The other children are very well-cast ; the boy playing Elia Kazan's " Googi " character looks especially like the adult " Googi " . The boy playing Mr . Cagney looks so different , you have to wonder if another actor might have been planned to star in this film . Additionally , the children are depicted as being about the same age , but the adult Cagney appears much older when they are adults ; he goes from being about Ms . Sheridan's age to looking like her father ! He looks too out-of-shape for the role , also , of the " Young Samson " . Frank Craven appears as " Old Timer " ; he seems to have great knowledge , but his role is confusing . Anthony Quinn is Ms . Sheridan's greasy dancing partner ( and abductor ? ) Murray Burns . For some reason , Mr . Quinn spent WAY TOO LONG in the make-up chair - his eye make-up is the film's heaviest ! Yet , the cast is worth watching . James Cagney is , after all , still Cagney . Mr . Kennedy and Mr . Kazan perform their parts very well . The structurally flawed story does move - and , Sheridan's profuse weeping could squeeze one out of you .

453550	15896852	2521	5.0	A Sweet and Harrowing Story of the Early West	The story begins by introducing two married couples - - prospector Charles Gorman ( as Jack Hardy ) and his " Homesick for the East " wife Blanche Sweet ( as Alice ) ; and , Mexicans Charles Hill Mailes ( as Jim ) and wife Claire McDowell . The husbands meet at a saloon , where the Mr . Gorman makes a laughing stock out of the " good-for-nothing " Hill Mailes , then throws him out of the bar . Next , Hill Mailes joins a couple of cutthroats , and shoots " Indian " Robert Harron's father , just to watch him die . So , two of the film's characters seek revenge - - Hill Mailes wants to get even with Gorman for throwing him around ; and , Indian son Harron wants vengeance for his murdered father . Hill Mailes kidnaps his enemy's wife , Ms . Sweet ; and , despite advice from his Chief to keep the peace , Harron rounds up some Young Braves to go after Hill Mailes . Subtitled " A Story of the Early West " , " A Temporary Truce " compares very favorably with some of Director D . W . Griffith's more well-known " little epics " from the period . The southern California location sequences are exciting ; Griffith and cameraman G . W . Bitzer are , obviously , in the process of kicking up film-making a notch ( or two ) every year . Sweet gives a particularly fine performance as the kidnapped wife , and the other performers are , at least , interesting . Harron is noteworthy as the wronged Indian boy ; he steals the film , and tilts the story toward the unexpected side of the traditional " Cowboys and Indians " western . Extras include Mary's little brother , Jack Pickford , who joins Harron's Indian gang ; and , Mae Marsh is easy to spot as an murdered settler . It's strange to watch Ms . Marsh get attacked by Harron , so notable a future film partner !
452507	15896852	32851	5.0	Pacific Northwest Indian Wipe Out	Spencer Tracy ( as Major Rogers ) gets Robert Young ( as Langdon ) and Walter Brennan ( as Hunk ) drunk , so they'll become members of his Colonial American Rangers , and head for the " Northwest Passage " of the title . Along the way , they kill many Indians ( aka Native Americans ) . The photography is the film's main attraction . This must have seemed like a grand classic when released in 1940 ; however , the epic quality has been equaled many times , and this film doesn't have enough other qualities to maintain classic status . Mr . Young's painting and Mr . Brennan's teeth are not characterization traits to last through the ages . Mr . Tracy performs well , as usual ; however , his Rangers look a little old , as a whole , to be making this journey . The most exciting scenes are when the Rangers burn an Indian village , and wipe out its inhabitants . Watch for it in the middle of the film , not the end . Be warned , though - it's a visceral slaughter . Addison Richards ( as Ranger Crofton ) is particularly sadistic ; later , he gets his turn . . .

Twelve is the new Eleven when Danny Ocean and pals return in a sequel to the cool caper that saw them pull off a $160 million heist . But $160 million doesn't go as far as it used to . Not with everyone spending like sailors on leave . Not with Vegas big-shot Terry Benedict out to recover his dough . And , not with a mysterious someone stalking Danny and crew . It's time to pull off another stunner of a plan - or plans ? " according to the sleeve's synopsis . The first problem with " Ocean's Twelve " is that the main plot involves the original team's effort to RETURN the money from the first film , or DIE . " Ocean's Eleven " involved viewers is rooting for the superstar team to GET the money ; and , none of them were killed . This film stabs the earlier one in the back . Perhaps , George Clooney ( as Ocean ) and his all-star team weren't so smart , after all . Probably , they should they have killed Andy Garcia's " Benedict " . NOW , they have to steal more money , to pay their " debt " . That's no fun . The " In Jokes " are smarmy . On the plus side , the locations and music ( David Holmes ) are exemplary . The " laser field dance " in the great hall moves along stylishly . Attractive Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel are strong shove-ins to the cast - but , really , Steven Soderbergh should have considered the " Ocean's Ten " , " Ocean's Nine " , " Ocean's Eight " , " Ocean's Seven " ? progression , ending with a George Clooney monologue on aging gracefully .

452428	15896852	19757	5.0	A Magic Show Murder Mystery	Holmes Herbert ( as Peter Dwight ) is a magician , and quick-change master-of-disguise ; he has assumed the role of Count Merlin , a " Master of Occult Services " . Margaret Livingston ( as Florence Dwight Talbot ) is his ex-wife , who , fifteen years earlier , took their baby daughter and hooked up second husband Rockliffe Fellowes ( as Richard " Dick " Talbot ) . Ms . Livingston isn't one to stand by her men , and has already decided to run away with her doctor , Philo McCullough ( as Walter Paynter ) . She goes to Mr . Herbert for a crystal ball reading , unaware he is her ex-husband ? You should know , initially , that the " crystal ball story " , early in the film , is the story of how Livingston took her daughter and left Herbert for Fellowes . It really isn't at all clear ( as either a bell , or a crystal ball ) . It's also astonishing how Livingston sits right down with Herbert for a dead-on perfect " reading " of their past , and doesn't know who he is , under the turban . She later says , " What a fool I was not to have recognized you ! " Indeed . Later , events are easier to understand . Circumstances lead to all the characters being in a house , during a storm . A murder is committed , and you're left wondering - who's the guilty party ? While there is some suspense , there are no real clues ( that I could see ) ; so you'll have to take a shot in the dark on this one . Herbert's is the film's main performance attraction ; he certainly is a master of disguise ! The Charlatan ( 1929 ) George Melford - Holmes Herbert , Margaret Livingston , Philo McCullough
452575	15896852	45883	5.0	Turn of the Page	After encountering rampaging Apache Indians , John Wayne ( as Hondo Lane ) and his dog lick their wounds at Geraldine Page ( as Angie Lowe ) ' s ranch . The plain Ms . Page is waiting for her husband to return ; however , she and manly Mr . Wayne are attracted to each other . Wayne teaches Page's boy Lee Aaker ( as Johnny ) how to swim . Page thinks Apache Michael Pate ( as Vittorio ) and his Indians are nice , but Wayne considers them savages . No points for guessing who is right . Colorful western action , with some " in-your-face " moments , since " Hondo " was originally filmed for 3-D . The film winds up being far too glossy for its own good , however . The supporting cast is notably fun . Page has her first featured film role ; it's nowhere near her best work , but she received Academy Award consideration . Watch for the scene where Wayne tells her , " I'm part Indian and I can smell you when I'm downwind of you , " with Page seeming more comely than " homely " . Ward Bond , a grizzly Wayne film regular , is seem in relative good light . Mr . Pate and James Arness shine , in their Apache war paint ; Pate reprised his Apache role for the television series . And , Mr . Aaker and Tom Irish get to learn lessons in western drama .

Two hundred years later , a newlywed couple is driving near the lake when their car crashes into the water . The husband comes to the surface unharmed but his young bride emerges from the water possessed by the spirit of the witch , looking for revenge upon the descendants of the townspeople who had killed her , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Writer / director Michael Reeves's " The Sister of Satan " is an exasperating feature . After showing great promise with " Witchfinder General " ( 1968 ) , Mr . Reeves died of a drug overdose . Although this film ( aka " The She Beast " ) should not be considered representative , the opening and a few other scenes are nicely done . The idea to bring the story into the " Dracula universe " was a good one - but , the comic aspects do not fit . Worst of all , the sizzling pairing of Ian Ogilvy ( as Philip ) and Barbara Steele ( as Veronica ) is given short shrift .

452365	15896852	43643	5.0	Hughes Kind of Woman	Gangsters hang in the nicest looking places . " His Kind of Woman " never , for me , becomes what it looks like it should be . It's just too long and complicated . I couldn't focus on any one plot or character . I found Vincent Price , Jane Russell , and the settings very enjoyable . I wish I could say they were distracting from a potentially great story - but , there is no great , cohesive story to match these surroundings . I don't think I have seen Mr . Mitchum drop a cigarette down the from of another thug's pants before - the guy seems to get over it quickly , so I guess it was a mild burn ! Mr . Price asks Mr .

452467	15896852	623166	5.0	Snatch the Pebble From My Hand	Chinese-American Kung Fu practitioner David Carradine ( as Kwai Chang Caine ) continues his wanderings in the American West , from the very successfully piloted TV-movie shown earlier in the year . For the most part , the series features a relatively high level of excellence in photography and performance ( with the obligatory martial arts scenes ) . It's surprising to read some controversy concerning Carradine's being cast in the lead role ; his convincing portrayal is , in hindsight , the driving force behind the series ' enduring worth . In episode one , Caine finds stability and happiness in a pseudo-family , after bringing orphaned Brandon Cruz ( as Peter Gideon ) to live on widow Lara Parker ( as Amy Allender ) ' s ranch . This is the " Shane " plot , with race replacing the original's natural father ( interestingly , Carradine starred in the 1966 TV version of " Shane " ) . Producers were wise to cast Mr . Cruz ( from " The Courtship of Eddie's Father " ) and Ms . Parker ( from " Dark Shadows " ) in the guest-starring roles ; certainly , they lured in additional viewers . Parker is especially effective ( and quite remarkably unlike her famous " Angelique " character ) ; she and Carradine convey an attraction that should have been the episode's primary focus . John Saxon ( as Raven ) is an effective home-wrecker . And , Mark Allen , another " Dark Shadows " alumni , appears very briefly , as a post office clerk who gives Cruz directions . A good start for " Kung Fu " . Kung Fu - King of the Mountain ( / 72 ) Jerry Thorpe - David Carradine , Brandon Cruz , Lara Parker
452980	15896852	120662	5.0	An Eyeful of Ashley	Good-looking Ewan McGregor ( as Stephen " The Eye " Wilson ) is a secret agent man assigned to stalk wigged-out Ashley Judd ( as Joanna Eris ) . Merrily posing through several stages of undress , Ms . Judd is a sexy serial killer . Mr . McGregor keeps his clothes on , but matches his prey in the emotionally disturbed department , as it turns out . Stephan Elliott's " Eye of the Beholder " is long on style , and short on substance ; unfortunately , its meandering story is difficult to follow . Still , whatever director Elliott , McGregor , and Judd are doing , they often make it look good . Cinematographer Guy Dufaux excels . The film is reminiscent of director Alfred Hitchcock , especially his " Rear Window " and " Vertigo " . The supporting cast includes Patrick Bergin , veteran Geneviève Bujold , and a non-singing k . d . lang . But , Jason Priestley ( as Gary ) gets the best part , and turns it into the film's strongest individual performance . Mr . Priestley is startlingly convincing as a bleached blond junkie on the make . Priestley is better with Judd and McGregor than they are with each other ; and , his characterization is the film's best representation of its obvious amoral intentions . Eye of the Beholder ( 1999 ) Stephan Elliott - Ewan McGregor , Ashley Judd , Jason Priestly

The deaths attract the attention of investigative reporter Dave O'Brien ( as Johnny Layton ) . As Mr . O'Brien moves closer to discovering Lugosi's dark secret , he places his own life in danger . And , he finds himself becoming attracted to beautiful Suzanne Kaaren ( as Mary Heath ) , a Bat target . . . Pleasantly surprising low-budget fun , from Lugosi and a likable cast .

Most of all , they consider his interest in flying an inappropriate hobby . After Mr . Beal gives the wife of another doctor a lift in his plane , it crashes ; and , the young woman dies . The accident becomes a national scandal , with the unwed Beal becoming romantically linked with his married passenger . After being put on probation , Beal gives up his privileged life , hitchhikes to California , and becomes a hobo . He is recognized by pilot friend Philip Huston ( as Dick Miller ) , who helps Beal get back up on his feet . Then , Mr . Huston , and pretty blonde nurse Joan Fontaine ( as Doris King ) help Beal turn his life around . Ms . Fontaine receives a special introduction in this , her first co-starring role . She is not only very obviously like her famous sister , but also very engaging . Fontaine's performances would grow more individual and adept , with increasingly better material . Although never growing into stars of Fontaine's stature , Beal and Huston are also quite good . It's nice to see the expressive Beal , who presided over the witchcraft trial of Quentin Collins on " Dark Shadows " , as a leading man . And , Huston essays a very convincing " drunk " scene .

She gets a jumps start by being a favorite mistress of Great Britain's King George III ( Jack Cosgrove ) . During the war , Ms . Gleason falls in love with sympathetic Howard Gaye ( as Lionel Esmond ) , who unknowingly holds a shocking secret - he's not only the would-be Queen's lover , but also her brother ! That wasn't what got producer Robert Goldstein's " The Spirit of ' 76 " in trouble ; rather , it was the film's depiction of British atrocities , including rape and baby-killing , during the American Revolution . Moreover , Mr . Goldstein was a German ; at the time , the US and the UK were aligned to fight against the Germans in the Great War ( World War II ) . Goldstein was sent to prison for film-making , unfortunately ; and , no prints of his infamous film are known to have survived the ages . The best way to experience the spirit of the film is through the pages and pictures in Anthony Slide's book " Robert Goldstein and The Spirit of ' 76 " ( Scarecrow Press , 1993 ) . The book has to be more interesting than the film , which could be described as a D . W . Griffith-inspired flicker , with some well-staged scenes .

But , Psychiatrist Leigh doesn't want to leave her patients ; especially three strikingly beautiful women , who can't seem to develop romantic relationships with men . Mr . Lewis decides to assume three different alternate identities , in order to warm up the three frigid women , and free up fiancée Leigh . Will things get too hot ? Leigh and the three women ( Mary Ann Mobley , Leslie Parrish , and Gila Golan ) are lovely looking ; but , don't watch for them to run around in bikinis and towels a lot - - there isn't much skin on display . James Best ( as Ben Mizer ) handles the role of Lewis ' straight man well . The supporting cast performs ably ; Kathleen Freeman and Buddy Lester are always fun to watch , drunk or sober . Lewis plays his " main " personality and four others - - " Warren " , " Ringo " ( not Beatle-influenced ) , " Rutherford " , and " Heather " . They are not complicated characterizations and , so , are not among is best . " Three on a Couch " is interesting in its overindulgence . It's the Lewis brand , with a drink in one hand , and a cigarette in the other . Note , the script and situations are drenched in alcohol . This gives the film a " drunk " , enochlophobic feel . The film's closing " party " has a surreal quality , with guests pouring into spaces they shouldn't fit . Lewis directs this " party " scene very effectively , by the way ; his directorial skill is sometimes overshadowed by his on screen persona - - he might have been wise to peruse a parallel career directing movies in which he does not appear .

Mainly , the film involves " down-and-out working stiffs " Sam Rockwell ( as Pero ) , Michael Jeter ( as Toto ) , Isaiah Washington ( as Leon ) , William H . Macy ( as Riley ) , and Andy Davoli ( as Basil ) . They plan " the BIG heist " - but things go comically wrong . Of the other players , George Clooney ( as Jerzy ) stands out - or , would that be sits out ? - as an expert the gang of five hires , for $500 , to learn safe-cracking . It's quite nice that Mr . Jeter's performance is a highlight , since this is one of his last . If only this comedy " re-make " of the Italian " I soliti ignoti " were funnier ?

Stanwyck rejects a regular sex partner arranged for " protection " , and thinks about changing her life . When her abusive father dies in his still , Stanwyck goes to wicked New York City . She finds a personnel office on 47th Street , and begins exchanging sexual favors for success . But , is she really happy ? " Baby Face " starts out great ; Stanwyck is typically captivating , especially in the opening scenes . Her character's plight is very effectively conveyed . Note how she opens the speakeasy window and blows steel mill town soot off the plants ; it's a wonderful bit of business . And , the sexual frankness is welcome . Unfortunately , the film descends into an increasingly silly sex melodrama . Though Stanwyck remains entertaining throughout , her " true love " story is not convincingly developed . The bewitched men : George Brent ( as Trenholm ) , Donald Cook ( as Ned Stevens ) , Alphonse Ethier ( as Adolf Cragg ) , Henry Kolker ( as J . P . Carter ) , and young John Wayne ( as McCoy ) are entertaining foils . But , Theresa Harris ( as Chico ) gives the film's best performance ; regrettably , her character's potential slips along with everything else .

He believes himself to be the reincarnation of an executioner who was assigned to protect the castle against invaders , and the photographer and models are his next victims , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Translated from the Italian as " Bloody Pit of Horror " ( but " The Crimson Executioner " would have made more literal sense ) . This film feature a stupendous " over-the-top " performance from good-looking muscle-man Mickey Hargitay ( as Travis Anderson ) . In real life , Mr . Hargitay was freshly divorced from buxom actress Jayne Mansfield . Herein , there are no women to rival Ms . Mansfield , which is good when you consider the contraption in Hargitay's dungeon that slowly slits into the bound models ' protruding breasts .

453629	15896852	9145	5.0	The Sincerest Form of Flattery	Director Allen Holubar's wartime D . W . Griffith imitation ; " Heart of Humanity " most closely resembles " Hearts of the World " ( 1918 ) , with actress / wife Dorothy Phillips ( as Nanette ) unsuccessfully impersonating Lillian Gish . Mr . Griffith took his cast to Europe ; but , Mr . Holubar begins closer to home , " In the Heart of Canada , " where Ms . Phillips blossoms . Judging by their longing looks , Phillips could have her pick among widow Margaret Mann ( as Mary Patricia ) ' s sons . Phillips picks the eldest , William Stowell ( as John ) . Erich von Stroheim ( as Eric von Eberhard ) steals the show ; he is Mr . Stowell's predictably two-faced friend . Robert Anderson ( as Paul ) also repeats his ( goofy ) " Hearts of the World " characterization . Mr . von Stroheim's role is much bigger than in " Hearts of the World " . And , von Stroheim certainly may have offered directorial advice ; observe , for instance , the sequence wherein the spider crawls under the neck of the Virgin Mary as Stroheim attempts to have his way with Phillips . The Stroheim " rape " scenes are the best in the film . With Stroheim around , assisting ( possibly ) in direction , Phillips is much more effective .

While on their way to pick up cute Boulder , Colorado coed Leelee Sobieski ( as Venna ) , the men hear a trucker named " Rusty Nail " on their CB radio . In a joke cooked up by Mr . Zahn , Mr . Walker pretends to be a sexy woman named " Candy Cane " ; and , he sets up a date with the horny " Rusty Nail " . Alas , the trucker can't take a joke , and decides to terrorize the travelers ! John Dahl's " Joy Ride " features some good locations and camera-work , which doesn't add up to as much as it should , due to the film's huge storyline familiarities ; it's sometimes suspenseful , and seldom scary . The lead character , and his likely complicated relationships with a troubled brother and potential girlfriend , come across as unusually bland . The intriguing " villain " ( well-voiced by Ted Levine ) is , also , not too intense . The earlier parts of the film are more interesting , and / or original ( the brothers in the hotel room , for example ) . The latter acts are less effective retreads . Notably , Walker and Zahn have a contrived public nude scene , courtesy of " Rusty Nail " . The " cornfield " part of " North by Northwest " is employed ; and , the old " gun and door " trick was used with more clarity and suspense by Thayer David ( as Count Petofi ) on " Dark Shadows " ( episode # 841 ) .

But , Ms . Pickford also wants to marry Allan Forrest ( as John Manners ) . The " Lord " and " Lady " set of Rutland Castle and Haddon Hall await her decision . Who will Pickford choose ? " Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall " is an expectedly opulent Pickford production . Its strength is in the rich sets and photography displayed on screen ; Pickford regulars Charles Rosher and Marshall Neilan contribute . Nepotism is represented not only by the presence of sister Lottie in a supporting role , but also by brother-in-law Forrest , who is a likable leading man . Pickford employs a touch of slapstick humor early in the running time ; possibly , as she playing a teenager . Reaching maturation , the character , and film , become exceedingly lugubrious .

They let their personal animosity affect their roles . The main movie seems to be about Howard Keel's production of " The Taming of the Shrew " . The framing has to do with Mr . Keel and Ms . Grayson quarreling . Both stories are musicals . I must confess , I didn't " get " this movie at all . A couple of gangster types somehow become part of the play . They throw stuff , like Mr . Keel's banana , at the audience . I wasn't alive in 1953 to see this , originally ; but , I remember the song " Another Opening , Another Show " from somewhere - it's played from time to time , but wasn't in the film " Kiss Me Kate " ( TCM just explained it was cut ) . I found the storyline and characters featuring Ann Miller and Tommy Rall much more entertaining . The songs were terrific .

Sadly , the man is really interested in her father's money - in disguise , he goes to rob Sweet's home ; then , our heroine gets a gun to confront the thief ? Sweet is entertaining in the starring role , relaying all the proper emotions with her face and gestures . There is a continuity distraction - note that the man's hat as he lies down seems to pop back on his head inexplicably . " The Painted Lady " ' s message doesn't really make too much sense .

The boyfriend consults with two priests in the hopes of getting guidance on his spiritual dilemma . The two priests in turn decide to perform an exorcism in order to rid the woman of her possession . The boyfriend and the exorcists are pitted in a battle for the woman's soul with Satan and his clan of worshipers , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This television movie has its strengths ; however , the story is very weak , and the production values do not entirely satisfy the need for horrific moments . For example , the cats perform well - - but , they are not very scary . Still , writer Jimmy Sangster and director Paul Wendkos handle the assignment well . The reason the Satanists could not simply kill the hero was one of the nicer touches ( though , arguably , it's inconsistent ) . The unsatisfying ending suggests a sequel or series was planned . There are several fine performances . Dack Rambo ( as Andy Stuart ) is quite likable in the lead role ; he is very appealing as the persistent , romantic magazine writer who meets fashion designer Elyssa Davalos in San Francisco , after denting her car . Due to an opening prologue , we know Ms . Davalos is likely the woman chosen to birth the " Anti-Christ " . Davalos provides the " Rosemary's Baby " recall , and Kim Cattrall ( as Linda ) helps add " The Exorcist " to the proceedings . Thankfully , Mr . Rambo and his co-stars stay focused on their characterizations , and don't venture " over the top " . Priestly John Harkins ( as Father Wheatley ) is always a welcome supporting player ; he was unforgettable on " Dark Shadows " , blackmailing Chris Pennock and frightening Joan Bennett ; and , of course , Mr . Harkins delivered the eulogy for the dearly departed " Chuckles the Clown " , causing Mary Tyler Moore's laughing fit . Priestly Dan O'Herlihy ( as Father Kemschler ) was a part of the " Shadows " - swipe " Dark Mansions " and essayed many memorable characters ; his supporting roles in " RoboCop " and " Twin Peaks " are memorable . Devilish Richard Lynch ( as Rimmin ) , meddling Erica Yohn ( as Agnes ) , and resolute Peggy McCay ( as Irene ) are also appealing . If only the story were better ?

Then , the story flashes back ? ? to begin in a French town , where pretty Mary Miles Minter ( as Rhoda Eldridge ) lives with her poor father , George Periolat ( as Charles Eldridge ) . When her sickly father dies , Ms . Minter learns he was a self-exiled American named Charles Sayles . Penniless , Minter gets a job as nursemaid to a wealthy woman voyaging to the United States ; so , Minter returns to her ancestral home . In America , Minter has trouble with lodging and employment . Finally , she manages to earn some money posing as the departed " Rosy Taylor " , servant for Ms . Howard . Then , while working , she is startled by the appearance of Howard's brother Allan Forrest ( as Jacques Le Clerc ) ; the hung-over man reports Minter to the authorities as a burglar , and she is sent to reform school . Minter escapes , and returns to work . Again , she meets Mr . Forrest , romance blooms , and mysteries unravel ? After a flashback , the film cleverly returns to the opening situation . Otherwise , this is a fairly routine Minter vehicle ; it resolves itself too quickly , and leaves promising characterization undeveloped . Minter is charming ; she was a genuine " child star " who remained very popular as a young woman , until her career ended in the wake of the scandal involving the shooting death of her then ( 1922 ) director / lover William Desmond Taylor . Supporting player Kate Price is memorable as kind-hearted landlady " Mrs . Sullivan " . Nitrate decomposition frequently mars the picture , but the film retains its integrity
452993	15896852	2423	5.0	The Passion of Pola Negri	The life story of French milliner's maid Pola Negri ( as Jeanne Marie Vaubernier ) , who becomes the famed mistress ( " Madame Du Barry " ) of Emil Jannings ( as King Louis XV ) . Unfortunately , the French Revolution catches " rags to riches " Ms . Negri on the wrong side of polite society . Her stalwart first love Harry Liedtke ( as Armand de Foix ) attempts to help out , but only to a point . This film is more important than entertaining , as it was director Ernst Lubitsch and cast's foray into much of the English speaking audience's world . The passionate performances raised both eyebrows and profits . However , the stodginess overwhelms scenes like lustful Mr . Jannings sending Negri into rapture by stuffing a scroll down her cleavage . Mr . Liedtke might have become bigger star in the USA , if fate were different ; he and Negri have great chemistry . Madame DuBarry ( / 19 ) Ernst Lubitsch - Pola Negri , Harry Liedtke , Emil Jannings
452997	15896852	23694	5.0	The Living Dead End	Bela Lugosi ( as Murder Legendre ) dabbles in odd things ; for example , he has created a crew of zombies to work sugar mills in Haiti . The island is a center of voodoo and mysticism , which makes it the perfect operational center for the hypnotic Mr . Lugosi . One evening , while walking around the local graveyard with some of his dead friends , Lugosi happens upon a coach carrying John Harron ( as Neil Parker ) and Madge Bellamy ( as Madeline Short ) . Mr . Harron and Ms . Bellamy are in Haiti to visit cruise acquaintance Robert Frazer ( as Charles Beaumont ) , and get married . Harron and Bellamy don't ( seem to ) know it , but Mr . Frazer has fallen in love with Bellamy . So , Frazer visits Lugosi , who considers turning the fair young Bellamy into a zombie . Actually , Lugosi seems to have planned the transformation from ( at least ) the opening scenes ( note when he snatches her spell enhancing scarf ) . Newlywed Harron is , of course , displeased with the whole affair . After drowning his sorrows , Harron begins to investigate the unfolding sinister events , enlisting the help of missionary Joseph Cawthorn ( as Dr . Bruner ) . Naturally , Lugosi contributes to some eerie visuals . Harron is strongest when suffering ; a nice scene has him getting drunk , with some shadowy figures closing in . Bellamy is strongest whilst spellbound ; a nice scene has her walking through a rock-like opening that matches the design on her dress . " White Zombie " is an entirely too stiff thriller , partially redeemed by some creepy atmosphere . The story might be improved by combining elements of the " Beaumont " character into the roles played by Lugosi and Harron ( just for starters ) . You may wonder about Lugosi taking what he calls a " fancy " to Frazer ; especially , when you consider the general gender of his staff . And , get ready to say , " Hi-ho Silver , away ! " when Brandon Hurst's butler makes his big splash . White Zombie ( / 32 ) Victor Halperin - Bela Lugosi , John Harron , Madge Bellamy
452581	15896852	33021	5.0	" F " in History	After graduating from West Point , handsome cadet Errol Flynn ( as Jeb Stuart ) finds romance with lovely Olivia de Havilland ( as Kit Carson Holliday ) , and fights abolitionist Raymond Massey ( as John Brown ) . Along the old Santa Fe Trail , politics is on everyone's mind . Mr . Massey wants to free slaves through terrorism ; but , Mr . Flynn believes the " Negro " problem will work itself out peacefully . Ms . de Havilland wonders whether Kansas should join the US as a slave , or free state . The slaves are frightened . " Santa Fe Trail " is very nice looking historical fiction . Director Michael Curtiz and company are clearly accomplished filmmakers . The co-starring team is charming , as usual ; and , Ms . de Havilland creates a great female characterization , with the limited material given . The best performance is offered by Van Heflin ( as Carl Rader ) ; his character grabs the spotlight very early , and never really lets go . Although it would have been out of the question in a Flynn film , it might have been nice to retool the script around Mr . Heflin's duplicitous character . Mr . Massey , a bug-eyed psycho at one point , would play a more flattering Brown in " Seven Angry Men " ( 1955 ) . The film plays too fast and loose with facts for comport . Its point of view is not vague : that the South recognized the immorality of slavery , and would have worked it out peacefully ; and , that abolitionists practiced unnecessary terrorism . This film's portrayal of " The Negro Problem " is offensive .
452371	15896852	43476	5.0	Triple Fizzle	The three stars - Frank Sinatra , Jane Russell , and Groucho Marx - make the film interesting and enjoyable ( if you like them ) . Everything else seems routine . At one point , when Mr . Marx is discovered smoking a cigar in Mr . Sinatra's bathtub , the movie threatens to become surreal . This scene could not have happened in this movie ; it violates the structure of the film up to that point . . . but , if the film had stayed with that " possible - only - in - a - Marx - Brothers " situation , it might have become something other than routine . And , of course , I can't pass up a " Merry XMas , Groucho ! " ( . . . which I didn't catch Ms . Russell or Mr . Sinatra wishing ! ) Hey , it would have made me laugh .

452989	15896852	37408	5.0	Two Girls , a Sailor , and a Variety Show	Extremely long World War II story about " Two Girls and a Sailor " ( portrayed by June Allyson , Gloria DeHaven , and Van Johnson ) . The threesome from the customary " love triangle " - will Sailor Johnson choose pert June Allyson or sexy Gloria DeHaven ? The film would be more accurately titled , " Two Girls , a Sailor , and a Variety Show " because the singing sisters aren't just shown at work - every act in their musical revue is shown . It's like a Musical spliced with a Variety Show ; and , it clocks in at over two hours without ever becoming anything more than low average . June Allyson , Jimmy Durante , Harry James , and Gracie Allen have fine moments ; and , it's nice to see " Inka Dinka Doo " and all of the other 1944 era acts preserved on film . Two Girls and a Sailor ( 1944 ) Richard Thorpe - June Allyson , Van Johnson , Gloria DeHaven
452546	15896852	24334	5.0	A Reform School Knock-Out	While waiting for the jury's decision at her murder trial , beautiful Loretta Young ( as Mary Martin ) recalls her life , in flashback . An unfortunate childhood ends with Ms . Young being sent to a reform school ; upon release , she falls in with a bad crowd , led by handsome Ricardo Cortez ( as Leo Darcy ) . In an attempt to go legit , moll Young meets suave lawyer Franchot Tone ( as Tom Mannering Jr . ) ; and , they fall in love . Then , predictably , Young's past catches up with her ? Young and chum Una Merkel ( as Bunny ) are remarkably good playing themselves as young girls , in the opening ; and , Mr . Cortez plays his final scene very well , as directed by William A . Wellman . An interesting , but irrelevant , newspaper headline reads , " Hitler Said to Be Gaining in Popularity " , after Andy Devine ( as Sam Travers ) ' s voice cracks . Midnight fun .
453157	15896852	39645	5.0	Don't Give Up Hope	Baby photographer Bob Hope ( as Ronnie Jackson ) is on death row , for a murder he didn't commit . While preparing for his stint in the ( laughing ) gas chamber , Mr . Hope tells his story , in flashback ? Hope isn't happy taking baby pictures . His real desire is to become a successful a private detective , like " Sam Spade " or " Philip Marlowe " . To wit , Hope is hired by beautiful Baroness Dorothy Lamour ( as Carlotta Montay ) , to solve the mystery of her missing husband / uncle ? Medium done Hope is better than most , not as good as some . The material is a bit lame , but Hope handles it expertly . Peter Lorre ( as Kismet ) and Lon Chaney Jr . ( as Willie ) lead a fine supporting cast . The frequent co-starred Ms . Lamour is a perfectly subtle spoof counterpoint to Hope's wisecracking coward . Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby bookend the film with two highly entertaining " cameo " appearances . The stuffing in-between gets a little too long and thin , at times . My Favorite Brunette ( 1947 ) Elliott Nugent - Bob Hope , Dorothy Lamour , Peter Lorre
453306	15896852	22430	5.0	A Neighborhood of Plain People in an American City of Today	An average family's life is disrupted when they inadvertently witness gangsters murder two men ; one is a policeman . Walter Huston ( as Whitlock ) is the district attorney who will become involved with the case . The family is headed by Frances Starr and Grant Mitchell ( as Ma and Pa Leeds ) . The Leeds ' have four children : George Ernest ( as Donny ) , Dickie Moore ( as Ned ) , Edward J . Nugent ( as Jackie ) , and Sally Blane ( as Sue ) . Just before the shootings , the Leeds family is visited by Ma's drunken father Charles " Chic " Sale ( as Private " Gramps " Summerill ) . The Leeds family is terrorized by the gangsters ; of course , they do not want any of the family to identify the shooter ( nicely mugging Ralph Ince ) . The gangsters strong-arm and , eventually , kidnap one of the Leeds boys ( Ernest as Donny ) . But , interestingly , Mr . Sale ( as " Gramps " ) seems to put his " country " over his grandson , and agrees to become " The Star Witness " . Sale's drunken old grandfather portrayal is more than a little hard to take ; and , the character is an odd vehicle in which to support the " patriotic " point-of-view expressed by " The Law " ( Huston ) . Ernest does an excellent job , especially in the scene with ex-baseball player Mike Donlin ( as Mickey ) ; and , William A . Wellman directed the film's action sequences well .
452590	15896852	53054	5.0	Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randall are an Odd Couple	Rambunctious Debbie Reynolds ( as Mariette Larkin ) gets the urge to mate with tax collector Tony Randall ( as Lorenzo Charlton ) . And , he wants to mate with her ! - How ? - Well , farming father Paul Douglas ( as Sidney " Pa " Larkin ) doesn't pay taxes ; he trades things , and raises piglets . Maryland " Ma " Una Merkel raises children , and bakes blueberry pies . Ms . Reynolds rides a pig into wealthy neighbor Philip Ober ( as Wendell Burnshaw ) ' s mansion , prompting Mr . Ober to summon Mr . Randall from the IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) . Will Randall collect taxes , Reynolds , or both ? Reynolds and Randall are not a very convincing romantic couple . They should have considered casting , perhaps , Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue . Randall dances a drunken melody of " Frère Jacques " / " I've Got You Under My Skin " . This is followed by an impossibly implausible ( even for this type of film ) implied sex scene , with Reynolds . Director George Marshall gives it an appropriate feature-length " sit-com " treatment ; but , the material makes the increasing slapstick more painful than funny ( witness the " barn " fight scene ) . The supporting cast , with its old pros and fresh faces , is a treasure trove , however . The Mating Game ( 1959 ) George Marshall - Debbie Reynolds , Tony Randall , Paul Douglas
453593	15896852	19993	5.0	Mike Fright	MGM's " Hollywood Revue " often comes off like an elaborate amateur " Talent Show " from an otherwise uninvolved in show business group of people . It could be any school , or workplace . Everyone gets a role , and a few people stand out . The early appearance by Joan Crawford sets the tone . She is clearly not at her best , performing a song and dance ; but , she is enthusiastic . So , the company's workforce goes through their assigned tasks , for better or worse . As a variety show , the movie is sometimes good ; but , the brighter spots can't justify its length . It's also a chance to see some big name " stars " in a disappointing light . Without a doubt , the three MGM stars shining brightest are the non-appearing Greta Garbo , Lon Chaney , and Ramon Novarro . Mr . Navarro would have appeared ; but , he was abroad , with his family . Of those appearing , Conrad Nagel and Jack Benny ( his debut ) do well hosting . Mr . Nagel is especially good , singing " You Were Meant for Me " ( to Anita Page ) well enough to have pursued a singing career . Nagel and Bessie Love were already " sound " investments for MGM . The middle rendition of " Singin ' in the Rain " ( the black and white one ) is nice looking ; and , it's a terrific song . Plans to make the " Hollywood Revue " an annual embarrassment were canceled . The Hollywood Revue of 1929 ( 1929 ) Charles Reisner - Jack Benny , Conrad Nagel , John Gilbert
452958	15896852	64606	5.0	The People versus Don Knotts	Clean and decent ornithologist Don Knotts ( as Abner Peacock IV ) is about to see his poor-selling bird-watching magazine peck it in . Meanwhile , smut-peddling publisher Edmond O'Brien ( as Osborne Tremain ) loses his magazine's license , due to pornographic content . To continue printing his bosomy babes , O'Brien tricks Knotts into turning over his periodical's editorial content . After sending Knotts off on safari , O'Brien turns the tame " Peacock's Magazine " into a titillating masturbatory aide . Knotts returns to find himself corralled into becoming the defendant in a " free speech " case . With assistance from enterprising editor Anne Francis ( as Lisa La Monica ) , Knotts is transformed into a Hugh Hefner-type publishing giant . Then , Ms . Francis falls in love with playboy Knotts . . . Knotts can't help but be funny ; this particular characterization was perfected in his role of " Mr . Furley " on the TV series " Three's Company " . His " Abner Peacock " is little less sure , perhaps necessarily so , considering the times . Note , the screeching and shouting was not part of Knotts ' later routine . Under-appreciated writer / director Nat Hiken cleverly mixes satire and sexy women . " The Love God ? " is colorful , and features a delightful supporting cast . Unfortunately , by the last act , the film's direction , and humor , has pointedly unraveled . The Love God ? ( 1969 ) Nat Hiken - Don Knotts , Anne Francis , Edmond O'Brien
453136	15896852	39678	5.0	Spanish Trail Mix-Up	With " The Great Southwestern Tent Show " in town , cowboy king Roy Rogers ( as Roy Rogers ) learns a featured attraction , his singing " Sons of the Pioneers " pals , have a $10 , 000 I . O . U . debt due . From sleepwalking constable Andy Devine ( as Cookie Bullfincher ) , Mr . Rogers learns about a convenient $10 , 000 reward for the capture of a bandit known as " The Gypsy " . Rogers wants to capture the Spanish outlaw , and pay off his friends ' debt . But , Rogers ' target , Tito Guízar ( as Rico ) , may not be the guiltiest gun in the west ? This colorful " cross-over " western for singing cowboys Rogers and Mr . Guízar is better than " The Gay Ranchero " ( 1948 ) , a similar vehicle . Pretty Dale Evans stand-in Jane Frazee ( as Candy Martin ) arouses romantic feelings in both men ; she has an amusing introductory scene , with Rogers collecting her undergarments from a fallen suitcase - watch as he holds her slip in his teeth ! Estelita Rodriguez ( as Lola ) is memorable . The songs are smooth and forgettable , except for Ms . Rodriguez ' lively " Guadalajara " . The ending is well staged . On the Old Spanish Trail ( 1947 ) William Witney - Roy Rogers , Tito Guízar , Estelita Rodriguez
452514	15896852	35799	5.0	Don't Take Any Wooden Yen	Suave submarine skipper Cary Grant ( as Cassidy ) leads a Christian crew from San Francisco to Tokyo Bay , to fight the Godless Japanese . A flag-waver , " Destination Tokyo " sailed into theaters while World War II was being fought . Debuting director Delmer Daves and his cast manage to deliver some engaging performances , despite a stereotyped script , and some occasionally toyish production values . Star Grant is enjoyable , albeit not entirely successful , in an atypical war hero role . Soldiering John Garfield ( as Wolf ) and Dane Clark ( as Tin Can ) head up a likable crew . Veteran fellow traveler Alan Hale ( as Cookie ) goes through the motions , which is enough . Mr . Clark and John Forsythe ( as Sparks ) make good early career impressions . John Ridgely ( as Raymond ) , Warner Anderson ( as Andy ) , and Tom Tully ( as Mike ) are also featured . The uncredited cast is noteworthy , including Whit Bissell ( as Yo Yo ) and Carlyle Blackwell Jr . ; the latter's father , Carlyle Blackwell ( Sr . ) , was one of Hollywood's first genuine " superstar " actors . The most amusing " dramatic " interplay culminates with inexperienced William Prince ( as Pills ) deciding to operate on impossibly doe-eyed Robert Hutton ( as Tommy ) ' s ruptured appendix . Ouch ! Destination Tokyo ( 1943 ) Delmer Daves - Cary Grant , John Garfield , Dane Clark
453302	15896852	37508	5.0	Missed It by That Much !	Gary Cooper plays a singing cowboy named Melody Jones who is mistaken for a robber named Monte Jarrad ( they have the same initials ) . Loretta Young is his love interest Cherry de Longpre - she helps out Mr . Cooper and pal William Demarest . The odd character names are a a clue this was intended as a comedy . With a couple of exceptions , the comedy isn't all that funny . There are other times when " Along Came Jones " didn't look at all comic ? so , I was confused . The best part of the film is the first kiss between Cooper and Ms . Young . It happens after they do a saddle switch . Cooper wipes his lips on his sleeve and kisses Young . Then she says , " Thank you ! " in brilliant movie star focus - do not miss this kiss ! The worst part of the film was the obvious cheap looking way they rode along on their horses in front of a projection screen . Even worse that that is the fact that you can't really tell , from the overall film , how we ( audiences ) are supposed to take the movie . Whatever the filmmakers intended missed , obviously . I'll take it as a comedy with top stars and a couple of good laughs . Along Came Jones ( 1945 ) Stuart Heisler - Gary Cooper , Loretta Young , William Demarest
453324	15896852	65687	5.0	Lost and Found in Las Vegas	Since this captures Elvis at the beginning of his white jump-suited Vegas years , it's valuable . The song performances range from great to rushed , depending on what kind of effort Elvis wants to put into a particular song . As a total performance , it is good - but , it doesn't tell the whole musical story that is Elvis Presley . As a documentary , it's no great shakes . Since we knew Elvis was an extraordinary vocalist , what else doe the film show ? I was surprised by the backstage " banter " sessions - it looked , to me , like some of Elvis ' friends and personnel were confused about their own relationships with " The King " . They seemed , at times , more like idol-worshiping fans than real friends - laughing at bad jokes and demonstrating random subservience . Elvis ' fame must have been difficult all those concerned .

453525	15896852	47200	5.0	It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad Magician !	This was enjoyable , but certainly no classic . It's fun to watch the actor Vincent Price in these insane roles . I was surprised to read , in the credits , Eva Gabor was a player ; I thought she looked familiar , but she did not have the familiar wig from later years . The furnace was hot , but the disguises were easy to see through , I thought . The final scene had good suspense , but I knew Mr . Price's character was going to hop on that conveyor belt . Lenita Lane and Jay Novello seemed very familiar as the Prentiss couple . They must have played these kind of roles in other films ; they should starred in a TV sit-com .

452364	15896852	25617	5.0	Watch for Garbo	This film begins with a failed set-up : specifically , Ms . Garbo's younger sister marries , and it is implied that Garbo is becoming an " old maid " . Suddenly , Mr . Marshall's doctor character reveals he has been in love with Garbo since they were 12-year-old schoolchildren . At last , Garbo has a suitor ! At last , Dr . Marshall finds a woman ! Then , the entire supporting cast is wiped away as the quickly wedded couple moves to China . In China , Garbo wears funny hats and attracts the attention of Mr . Brent . Now , the film is a " love triangle " . Next , cholera erupts , giving the doctor's life much purpose ( a " War on Cholera " ) . About an hour into the film , Garbo begins to give flashes of a fascinating acting performance - peaking in the scene where she makes coffee for estranged husband Marshall . Her skills are wasted , however , in this poorly executed film . The Painted Veil ( / 34 ) Richard Boleslawski - Greta Garbo , Herbert Marshall , George Brent

There , she moves in with her generous , more well-to-do sister Polly Moran ( as Polly Rochay ) . Ms . Dressler joins Ms . Moran at work in her " Beauty Parlor " and " Reducing " salon , with calamitous results . Dressler is frequently funny , and Moran mostly so ; but , the comedy suffers whenever the focus becomes their respective daughters ' love story . Dressler and Moran squabble over the younger women's interest in the same man , which becomes an issue about class . Still , Dressler is terrific , especially in the first half . And , capable daughters Anita Page ( as Vivian Truffle ) and Sally Eilers ( as Joyce Rochay ) strengthen the weaker parts .

Laughton is pulling the King's leg . One of the Captain's seafaring crew of cutthroats , heroic Randolph Scott ( as Adam Mercy ) , poses a threat . Laughton killed Mr . Scott's father , and soon adds the father of beautiful-on-board Barbara Britton ( as Lady Anne Dunstan ) to his list of victims . Scott falls for the fetching Ms . Britton . Entertaining as always , Laughton makes the most of his role . Scott seems like a fish out of water ; and , to varying degrees , so do many in the cast . The interesting crew features " first mate " performances from Reginald Owen ( as Shadwell ) and John Carradine ( as Povey ) . Smaller roles essayed by Gilbert Roland ( as Lorenzo ) and William Farnum ( as Captain Rawson ) are equally satisfying . Alas , the production is rushed and unsatisfying , despite an " Oscar " - nominated score , by Werner Janssen . Captain Kidd ( / 45 ) Rowland V .

452593	15896852	197775	5.0	A Glad Look at an Old Book	Eleanor H . Porter's eternally optimistic " Pollyanna " ( Elizabeth Archard ) makes an earnest , faithful multi-hour English teleplay . But , faithful adaptations need to take the change of medium into consideration , and this production falters in following the novel rather laboriously . Its long , detailed establishment of characters and events results in some unnecessary dullness . Note the more well-known versions : 1920's " Pollyanna " ( Mary Pickford ) translated very nicely into the silent film format , while 1960's " Pollyanna ( Hayley Mills ) added too much " sugar " ( an unnecessary additive , considering this story ) . And , viewing too much of " Pollyanna " in one sitting is not for the faint of heart - you may want to start out with small doses . Cheers to Ms . Archard and her young leading man , Stephen Galloway ( as Jimmy Bean ) , as both demonstrate the presence and skill to have had more substantial acting careers . Slightly older Paddy Frost ( as Nancy ) and Robert Coleby ( as Timothy ) are also very engaging . Elaine Stritch ( as Aunt Polly ) , Ray McAnally ( as John Pendleton ) , and the location are also worth a look .

452975	15896852	20332	5.0	When Time Isn't Kind	Most old films noted as " of historical interest only " are actually very entertaining . " Rio Rita " is not . It is one of the better examples of the " historically interesting " film . It's also helpful if you view it as a extravagantly filmed stage production . The 1927-28 stage musical , produced by Florenz Ziegfeld , was a colossal success . And , the too long film version was voted 1927's fourth " Best Picture " , in the annual poll conducted by " Film Daily " . The opportunity to see " Rio Rita " on screen , in partial color , with popular Bebe Daniels ( as Rita Ferguson ) in her first speaking ( and singing ) role , proved irresistible at the box office . Ms . Daniels did not equal her 1920s silent successes , but extended her popularity into the early " talkie " era . Check out the debuting comedy team of Wheeler and Woolsey ( with Dorothy Lee ) in " Hips , Hips , Hooray ! " for a better representation of their work .

There , she meets suave , but crooked , Norman Foster ( as Douglas " Doug " Thayer ) . Mr . Foster is hot-and-bothered , and Bow is head-over-heels . " I thought you had ' It ' , " he tells her . Although Bow had long admired Foster's looks , she is put off by his forwardness . But , he pursues her to the alter . Can their marriage survive his underworld ties ? Paramount photography by Victor Milner gets " No Limit " off to a terrific start . The locations are great . Bow seems more self-assured than in previous " talkies " ; her voice was never as big a problem as were her nerves . It's difficult to believe Foster would fail to recognize Bow , even in the dark ; but , he is both a convincing and endearing heel . Stu Erwin ( as Ole Olson ) plays the unfortunate " dumb Swede " . The film provides an opportunity to see the first Mrs . Bing Crosby , pretty Dixie Lee Crosby ( as Dotty " Dodo " Potter ) . And , don't forget , Gary Cooper appears in " Fighting Caravans " .

453655	15896852	52862	5.0	The Great Missed Opportunity	Heralded , " This story is based on a true incident . Men of the Saint Louis Police Department play the same parts they did in the actual crime , " which is one of the less interesting elements about this film . Directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix ' documentary-style approach is more interesting . And , an early Steve McQueen stars ; although , obviously , this is before he found a feature film persona that worked . Trumping all in the interest department , however , is the homosexual relationships between the characters , both real and imagined . Mr . McQueen ( as George Fowler ) is a college drop-out , trying to lead the straight life . He is tempted into a life of crime , however , by ex-girlfriend Molly McCarthy ( as Ann ) ' s brother David Clarke ( as Gino ) . McQueen and Mr . Clarke have partnered up ; but , the roommates have had a difficult time finding honest work . So , they involve themselves with a bank heist , masterminded by Crahan Denton ( as John Eagan ) . The fifth wheel in the cast is getaway driver James Dukas ( as Willie ) . Mr . Dukas gives the film's best performance ; and , he has the most interesting role . Dukas began with head honcho Denton when he was a younger , thinner " kid " , a fact Denton cruelly enjoys mentioning ; and , the two obviously became lovers . They have a terrific bickering scene , which ends with Denton ordering Dukas , " Go take a bath , Willie . " Denton wants the younger McQueen to drive his getaway car , which makes Dukas very jealous . Too bad that jukebox could only afford to play one record . With a bigger budget , " The Great St . Louis Bank Robbery " coulda been a contenda .
452711	15896852	47603	5.0	A Slow Moving Lion in Winter	Robert Mitchum ( as Curt ) stars as bullying , titular head of the arguing Bridges family , electing himself over both parents , and brothers Tab Hunter ( as Hal ) and William Hopper ( as Arthur ) . In the dead of winter , the family is threatened by a marauding mountain lion ; the animal must be destroyed before it eats the Bridges family . Carl " Alfalfa " Switzer ( as " Chief " Joe Sam ) is the Bridges ' ranchhand ; the mountain lion killed his entire family some years ago . This is an exceedingly slow-moving and pretentiously written " psychological drama " . The direction ( William A . Wellman ) and photography ( William H . Clothier ) might be its most interesting feature . The Bridges ' home is decorated in blacks and whites , but shot in color ; this highlights the actors ' complexions , and an occasional symbolic item , like Mr . Mitchum's red jacket . Due to the " black and white in color " gimmick , or in spite of it , the film looks beautiful . But nothing can MOVE the " Track of the Cat " story , making the the film merely an interesting experiment . Beulah Bondi ( as Ma ) and Teresa Wright ( as sister Grace ) might fascinate fans . Surprisingly , Tab Hunter offers the film's leading performance ; emerging as the film's focus . Track of the Cat ( / 54 ) William A . Wellman - Robert Mitchum , Tab Hunter , Teresa Wright

A greedy couple - the alluring Maureen O'Hara ( as Shireen ) and her turbaned partner Anthony Quinn ( as Emir ) get in the way ? Colorful lethargy . The stars are much more interesting in other films , although Fairbanks Jr . is somehow engaging ; at least , he tries not to look completely bored . The story lacks both focus and humor , and it is way too long . Walter Slezak as " Melik the Hairdresser " is THE performance to keep your eyes on , if you watch ; he is delicious . . .

452822	15896852	24139	5.0	Clara Bow Calls It Quits	Fresh-faced student Richard Cromwell ( as Chris Miller ) jumps off a train , to join father Preston Foster ( as Nifty Miller ) ' s traveling carnival . Mr . Foster wants his son to stay away from the sleazy side-show folk , and pursue his interest in becoming a lawyer ; but , Mr . Cromwell wants to spend some quality time with his dad . With the kid around , Foster must move bed-partner Minna Gombell ( as Carrie ) to other quarters ; so , she slips under the covers with Clara Bow ( as Lou ) . Ms . Gombell doesn't appreciate losing her bed-space to Cromwell ; so , she asks Ms . Bow to seduce him . Bow says she doesn't want to be a " cradle robber " , but changes her mind for $100 . 00 . Bow and Cromwell try to make it believable , after her swimming scene ( to their credit ) ; but , watching them is like watching Mae West seduce Charles Ray . A re-make of " The Barker " doesn't seem like an inappropriate vehicle ; however , " Hoop-la " exploits the plumper Bow's past and ( at the time ) notoriety . This is precisely the kind of exploitation Bow should have been moving away from , at this point in her career . Not an awful film , all things considered . But not enough for Bow to carry on after all the " Hoop-la " . So Bow , born within only two years of Joan Crawford , Greta Garbo , and Katharine Hepburn ? sadly , retired .

453004	15896852	319262	5.0	Giving Global Warming the Cold Shoulder	Global Warming is accelerated to incredible levels , propelling the planet Earth into another Ica Age . Most frequently , the cameras find climatologist Dennis Quaid ( as Jack Hall ) and estranged son Jake Gyllenhaal ( as Sam Hall ) . Both men are strong , and smart . Mr . Quaid is one of the few who knows the seriousness of the matter . Mr . Gyllenhaal is smarter than his calculus teacher ; he does appear like he's been " kept back " a few years in high school , but this is probably because teachers are jealous of Gyllenhaal's intelligence . Quaid has not won any " Father of the Year " awards ; but , he really loves his son . Can Quaid save Gyllenhaal from the Global Warming monster ? Indulgent cliché-ridden idiocy ! Some money was obviously spent on " The Day After Tomorrow " , which means there are exciting , well-produced scenes . Roland Emmerich is an obviously very skillful filmmaker ; but , his story premises favor mindless blockbusters over enduring classics . The story renders its serious subject unintentionally ( ? ) nonsensical ; although , it is , admittedly , only a movie . Emmy Rossum ( as Laura Chapman ) and Sela Ward ( as Lucy Hall ) are the lovely love interests . Capable Ian Holm ( as Terry Rapson ) doesn't have much to do . Everyone watches FOX " News " channels . No wonder ! The Day After Tomorrow ( 2004 ) Roland Emmerich - Dennis Quaid , Jake Gyllenhaal , Emmy Rossum

His best pal Regis Toomey ( Jack Kulper ) has settled down with sweet pea planting wife Mary Astor ( as Lily Kulper ) . After a drunken escapade , Mr . Withers gets tossed out of his boardinghouse ; then , he moves in with the Kulpers . There , he falls in love with Ms . Astor , his best friend's wife ? Highly improbable melodrama , with a nonsensical , but somewhat riveting , ending . J . Farrell MacDonald ( as Peg Leg ) and James Cagney ( as Eddie ) are entertaining , in supporting roles . Director William A . Wellman , photographer Barney McGill , and the rain give the film a very nice " look " ; but , it's train in vain . Other Men's Women ( 1931 ) William A .

Rogers finds an abandoned fawn , and brings it to " The Sanitarium " - an animal refuge run by old friend Harry Cheshire ( as Cap . Foster ) ; there , he finds Mr . Cheshire treating the fawn's mother for a bullet wound . When the animal-loving Cheshire stumbles upon the gang of poachers , he is murdered . Rogers must find those responsible . Sheriff Andy Devine ( as " Cookie " ) lends an occasional hand . The characterizations are very good ; especially , the introduction , and disposal , of the character played by Harry Cheshire ( " Cap Foster " ) . The characters played by Stephanie Bachelor ( " Miss Loring " ) and Hal Landon ( " Bert " ) are also nicely drawn . Memorably , Rogers is dramatically beaten and left for dead in a meat freezer . Of course , Rogers escapes frozen death - and the ensuing shootout is quite exciting . During the obligatory shootout , note that the shots fired actually mean something ; there is no pointless shooting , so a sense of real danger prevails . " Good Girl " Jane Frazee and " Bad Girl " Loring have a cool fistfight , too . Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers demonstrate some excellent harmony and backing vocals on " A Cowboy Has To Sing " . On the other hand , " Oh , What a Picture " is dreadful - not only for Mr . Devine's " comedy " vocal , but also for ruining the dramatic pace of the film . A redundant comedy interlude follows almost immediately ( " What are You Going to Do Then ? " ) ; only one , if any , is really needed . The title song " Springtime in the Sierras " has a strained film tie-in .

453529	15896852	60463	5.0	Mermaid Doris Loses Her Bottom	The script , pacing , and editing of " The Glass Bottom Boat " fail Doris Day and Rod Taylor . It's a shame , because the movie seemed to have had a lot to offer . Surprisingly , Ms . Day plays an attractive divorced woman who has given up on romance ; instead , she enjoys her job , and a " family " of animals . Mr . Taylor , we assume , is otherwise interested in twentysomethings , but he is attracted to Day . Their introductory scene has Day half-naked , so we know Taylor is aware her sexual allure is not faltering . I thought their relationship was far to underplayed - Day subtlety touches on it in a scene following a romantic encounter ; but , we know too little of the lead characters ' past . The supporting players are fantastic - Paul Lynde looks great as a woman , showing he could have also played Endora on " Bewitched " ( as well as Uncle Arthur ) ! BUT , the script doesn't gel - it's a shame Taylor revealed he thought Day's character was too stupid to be a spy . Later , he says he loves her banana cream pies ; yet , we are left believing he really thinks she is stupid . They should have yelled , " RE-WRITE !

" With just 28 days before the execution , Adam sets out to retrace the events leading to the crime for which Sam was convicted . As the impending death sentence looms closer , Adam works quickly to uncover the family's history for any hidden clues . In a white-knuckle series of twists and turns , Adam discovers deceptions and dark secrets that ultimately lead him to the startling truth , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " White-knuckled " ? Indeed not . " The Chamber " ( as in gas chamber ) starts off very well ; and , Mr . Hackman's portrayal of the yellow-teethed racist is worth a look . Faye Dunaway ( as Lee Cayhall Bowman ) has a showy supporting role . All in all , the film's personnel portends a much better story than the one which appears on screen . Building up a romance between blue-eyed Mr . O'Donnell and brown-skinned Lela Rochon ( as Nora Stark ) seems like such an obvious way to improve the story ( whether or not it was done in the John Grisham novel ) , you've got to wonder how on Earth they missed the obvious .

Of course , there is a Woman between them ? she married one , but longs for the other - or , maybe she loved / loves them both ? The sets and photography are lovely . There is a big railroad and train running through town , which means robbers , and a lot of shooting , are obligatory . I guess the ending could be interpreted as a little open-ended , but I think Mr . Preston decides whether Mr . Ladd lives - or dies . . .

Kirkwood goes out on a hunting jaunt , in a canoe ; when he rises to fire at some game , the canoe capsizes . Apparently a poor swimmer , Kirkwood is rescued by nearby hunter Frank Powell ( as Ed ) . Mr . Powell helps dry Kirkwood off , and the two crawl under a blanket for the evening . The next morning , Kirkwood thanks Powell for his kindness , and goes on his way . Then , Ms . Leonard meets Powell , while on one of her shopping trips ; and , they kindle an attraction . Soon , Leonard and Powell are meeting regularly , and decide to run away together , leaving Kirkwood in the cold ? Remarkable 1909 story , content-wise , from D . W . Griffith , G . W . Bitzer , and the good folks at Biograph . Leonard's performance as a " torn-between-two-loves " woman is a highlight , ahead of its time . Her leading men do are quite good , also , with some implausible situations . " Fools of Fate " is a cut above the usual , due to its interesting premise , and Marion Leonard's performance .
453145	15896852	29942	5.0	Boys in the Hood	A success in its day , " Boys Town " is the story of how a Priest saves his " Home for Juvenile Delinquent Boys " . He takes in boys that society can't manage , and operates under the motto : " There is No Bad Boy . " Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney star as Priest and head Bad Boy . I was interested in seeing two great stars , Mr . Tracy and Mr . Rooney , work together . They don't . Norman Taurog directs . Rooney fails from going over-the-top , and Tracy sometimes look bored . They each have some moments . You can't fault Rooney for playing a part with the enthusiasm of " Strike Up the Band ! " when they give him scenes like the " black face " bit in " Boys Town " . Tracy doesn't get to wear any " black face " , so he comes off better . It looks like the only Black face in " Boys Town " is the one painted on " Whitey " . I like the " candy scenes " scenes . I liked the tribute to FDR by Tracy and Gene Reynolds ( as " Tony " ) . I didn't think the film was as good as its " message " ; the ingredients put in to the film do not mix well . It doesn't HAVE to be , but it isn't very realistic , either . A too sentimental presentation ( of a worthy message ) with some famous performances .

Pickford the leader of her Scottish island community . For most young women , the responsibility would prove too daunting ; but , the spunky Pickford perseveres . She whips the town into shape . Pickford finds romance with Matt Moore ( as Jamie Campbell ) ; but , a secret from his past threatens their future . This was the lesser of the collaborations between Pickford and director Maurice Tourneur . The perpetually stormy coastline photography is a strength , with Marblehead , Massachusetts doubling for Scotland . John van den Broek and Lucien N . Andriot handled the camera . Despite the promising storyline , Pickford's role as leader of her community disappoints . She appears to be a divine link between the people and God . When the Church needs parishioners , Pickford runs around town cracking her father's whip , which frightens worshipers into their pews .

Young Beck and Phil Fondacaro ( as Torok ) set out to turn the apartment into a fairyland for trolls . Mr . Hathaway sees through little sister's personality switch ; but , parents Michael Moriarty and Shelley Hack don't believe bratty Beck is a demon . So , Hathaway turns to gracefully aging witch June Lockhart ( as Eunice St . Clair ) for help . Julia Louis-Dreyfus ( as Jeanette ) makes a sexy debut , alongside off-screen partner Brad Hall ( as William ) . Hathaway and Ms . Lockhart are great assets ; but , the film's story is much more nonsensical and uninteresting than fantastical and intriguing .

They decide to stick around and extinguish the " Bad Man of Deadwood " and his wicked gang . The Rogers / Hayes / Payne trio ( plus cute pet ) are a treat as " Medicine " show people . This is an above average , concise Rogers western . Carol Adams ( as reporter Linda Barrett ) is a good romantic interest for Mr . Rogers ; though , they don't flirt enough . It's great to see silent star Monte Blue and weasely Jay Novello among the fine supporting players . It's all lower cost level movie stuff , but ever so pleasant .

Bebe Daniels ( as Ruth Wonderly ) is the femme fatale with whom he becomes involved , along with Dudley Digges ( as Gutman ) and Otto Matieson ( as Dr . Cairo ) ; for various reasons , they all seek " The Maltese Falcon " . It's an exceptionally rare piece ! The production " look " of this early " talkie " is nowhere near as good as " The Maltese Falcon " ( 1941 ) , which was directed by John Huston , and starred Humphrey Bogart . However , this 1931 version is more enjoyable that you'd expect ; it is especially recommended as a viewing addendum to its better known re-make ( s ) . Mr . Cortez and Ms . Daniels liven things up with some sexual play ; this was so subdued in the 1941 version , it was almost sexless . Mr . Matieson and Una Merkel ( as secretary Effie ) are the best supporting performers . In this version , the characters ' actions make more sense . There are a few noticeable story differences ; for example , this one ends quite differently . . .

His life is complicated when his best friend Jack W . Johnston ( as Steve ) gets involved with town gangster William ' Billy ' Elmer ( as Trampas ) . The part , early on , with Mr . Farnum and Hosea Steelman ( as Lin McLean ) exchanging guests ' babies while they dance and drink whiskey , is amusing . There are some interestingly set-up outdoor shots from director Cecil B . DeMille . The story is sometimes odd ; for example , Mr . Johnston takes up with Mr . Elmer , it's stated , as Farnum " neglects " him to be with Ms . Kingston . Later , Johnston writes something on a newspaper - " good by ( unreadable ) i couldn't speak to you without ( unreadable ) the baby Steve " . I watched it with my finger on still , and still couldn't figure it out . Among the featured players . Johnston delivered the best performance .

Gilbert Roland ( as Mike Petrakis ) heads up an entertaining supporting cast . Mr . Wagner's hair is darkened to appear more Greek ( but his on-screen sister's locks are spared ) . Ms . Moore is fetching . Still , Edward Cronjager ( photographer ) and Bernard Herrmann ( musician ) are director Robert Webb's most valuable players . The film helped put Wagner on the map ; he won a " Photoplay Gold Medal " as filmdom's best new actor ; moreover , he and Moore easily made Martin Quigley's Annual Top 10 " Stars of Tomorrow " list , for 1953 .

Ms . Pickford is best during the well-photographed Karl Struss storm , and post-storm , scenes ; and , Mr . Fairbanks give the best overall performance in the picture . Pickford improves much upon her previous " Coquette " ; and , Fairbanks proves himself a fine " talking " film actor . While relatively well-received , at the time of release , this " Shrew " fell considerably shy of being highly regarded . Still , for what it is , it's more enjoyable than embarrassing . Certainly , it should appeal to admirers of Pickford and Fairbanks . The Taming of the Shrew ( / 29 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , Edwin Maxwell

When famed stage actress Constance Collier ( as Julia Gibbs ) comes in for a costume , Ms . Hutton reveals she is a fan . Since Ms . Collier doesn't have the $98 for an ordered garment , Hutton offers to deliver it to the troupe , and retrieve payment . There , Hutton receives no $98 ( nobody has the money ) ; instead , she is invited to audition for " The Farrington Players " a Shakespearian troupe . Although she can't act , handsome John Lund ( as Michael " Mike " Farrington ) hires her . Of course , they fall in love . After Hutton ruins one too many plays , she leaves " The Farrington Players " , and gets a job working for William Demarest ( as George " Mac " McGuire ) in the fledging motion picture industry . At " Artcraft Pictures " , Hutton becomes a big star , in movie serials like " The Perils of Pauline " . BUT , stardom has its pitfalls ? This is a very glossed over version of silent film actress Pearl White's life . Hutton plays well in the re-created " silent " scenes ; though neither she nor the script offer any real characterization . Billy De Wolfe ( as Timmy Thompson ) is good in a supporting role ; he inexplicably teaches her how to " project " after her very successful stage audition ( again , it's the script ) . De Wolfe would have made a nice rival for Hutton's affections . Collier steals the show , and she gets to say , " Greetings , fellow thespians ! " An early song , " The Sewing Machine " , is performed poorly by Hutton - - you would have the impression she can't act or sing ! However , she sings and performs the additional songs well . " Rumble , Rumble , Rumble " is the musical highlight . If you think you've heard " The Sewing Machine " somewhere , it's really just a re-make of " McNamara's Band " , which was a big hit for Bing Crosby when this movie was being made . Possibly , the filmmakers liked it , and ordered up a copy . If you're watching for original silent screen actor appearances , like William Farnum , don't blink .

Mr . Nakamura takes charge of the situation by killing his brother ; then , Peter Dyneley ( as Larry Stanford ) conveniently shows up ; a self-described " brilliant and highly underpaid foreign correspondent " , Mr . Dyneley wants to interview Nakamura about his research on " the secrets of evolution " . Nakamura is a very perceptive mad scientist ; he senses Dyneley is a sex-stared alcoholic , who lies about his age . Dyneley laps up Nakamura's offer of booze and flooze . With some re-writes and re-takes , George Breakston ( who directed " Andy Hardy " ) might have had a genuine classic . Still , " The Manster " is some good fun .

And , later on , " Playboy Playmate " Staley gets to show her bare shoulders and legs while dressing ( behind a conveniently large tree , however ) . This episode features a very enjoyable guest performance , by Staley . She and Mr . Brown perform their " re-encounter " scene exceptionally well . " Anybody Here Seen Billy ?

Depp stars as Dean Corso , an unscrupulous rare-book dealer who is hired to locate the remaining copies of ' The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom , ' a demonic manuscript that can summon the Devil . Corso becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving murder , theft , and satanic ritual ; and , ultimately finds himself confronting the devil incarnate , " according to official synopsis . In order to look old , bookish Depp occasionally has a chalk-like substance added to his temples . He treats rare old books indelicately , and sometimes blows tobacco smoke on them . Despite these early warnings , " The Ninth Gate " becomes intriguing , as Depp's character unfolds the mysteries of three Satanic volumes , and their differing illustrations . Emmanuelle Seigner and Lena Olin are obviously bad news , but Depp messes with them anyway . The major film's main weakness in that it doesn't go anywhere with its promising storyline ; and , most importantly , it lacks a satisfactorily ending . You might even call it incoherent ( see for yourself , if you dare ) . Darius Khondji's cinematography , and wheelchair-bound devil worshiper Barbara Jefford ( as Baroness Kessler ) are strengths .

Despite his aching tooth , Reese is sent , by Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) out to find the wayward Mr . Haydn . The going gets tough when an old foe , Ken Lynch ( as Anson Jones ) , recognizes Reese , and seeks revenge for a past prison term . After several lackluster episodes , " Laredo " gets back in the saddle . This episode has good direction ( Paul Stanley ) , writing ( Edward J . Lasko ) , and photography ( William Margulies ) . The opening action is taken from prior adventures ( the flaming arrow hitting the wagon train is a dead giveaway ) ; but , the stock footage , new location , and set material blend very well . Mr . Brand's toothy " Reese " is at his most memorable ; and , though underutilized , the series co-stars all appear - and to good effect . Hank Patterson ( Fred Ziffel of " Green Acres " ) , and Lynch's mob ( Len Lesser , Paul Mantee , Erik Holland ) lead a strong supporting cast .

" The Kiss Before the Mirror " is a strange , almost offensive , and downright dumb story ; but , it's done with a fine director ( James Whale ) and an interesting cast . Jean Dixon ( as Hilda ) almost saves it , with her pointed courtroom comment to Morgan . Donald Cook , Walter Pidgeon , and Gloria Stuart are good-looking lovers . From now on , viewers , you must carefully watch how women put on their make-up - it could help you decide whether or not to shoot them ( just kidding ) .

452661	15896852	55047	5.0	Behind Blue Eyes	This film was unjustly nicknamed " I Was a Teenage Jesus " , as star Jeffrey Hunter neither was , nor does he look , like a " teenager " . Rather , his appearance quite matches the idealized " Jesus " very much accepted by many Christians . Actually , Mr . Hunter is , overall , the correct age to be portraying Jesus Christ ; although he is perhaps , a little too " hunky " looking . H . B . Warner , who starred in Cecil B . DeMille's original " King of Kings " was far too old . Admittedly , Mr . Warner was , with the help of a softening lens , more successful essaying the role than Hunter . The angling direction , by Nicholas Ray is interesting , if uninspiring . Miklos Rozsa's music is lovely , contributing greatly to the film's reverence . There are some nice supporting performances ; I enjoyed , for example , Hurd Hatfield's " Pilate " ? and some of the others were amusing , at least . " King of Kings " has a big , colorful look - - but , it's one of the duller entries in the Biblical epic genre . It's a handsome production , but it might take a miracle for me to sit through " King of Kings " again . King of Kings ( 1961 ) Nicholas Ray - Jeffrey Hunter , Hurd Hatfield , Robert Ryan

As the latter , he accidentally marries Ms . Wilson to his visiting brother Clarence Burton ( as Ninian Deacon ) while they are out for dinner . Schoolteacher Milton Sills ( as Neil Cornish ) is also interested in Wilson ; though , curiously , nobody seems to notice this for the longest time . Ethel Wales tries , unsuccessfully , to look old enough to play the family grandmother . Lois Wilson's fine acting ability is clearly evident ; at different times , she is like both Lillian Gish and Bette Davis - see , for example the scene where she " lets her hair down " upon meeting Mr . Burton ( Gish ) , and her confrontation , finally , with Mr . Roberts ( Davis ) . The story is ambitious : " Lulu Bett " and the other members of the Deacon household are clearly being controlled by the " Master " Deacon ; and , " Lulu " is practically a slave . Yet , the various characters are shells of something larger - and their shells are not filled with enough characterization , background , or motivation to make this movie really work .

453249	15896852	6731	5.0	Moving Forward	Years ago , Norma Talmadge ( as Grace Briggs ) and her crooked partner Eugene Palette ( as Jimmy Briggs ) helped locksmith and gang leader Ralph Lewis ( as John Higgins ) commit burglaries . After falling in love , Ms . Talmadge and Mr . Lewis married . Later , Lewis was arrested , and went to prison for his crimes . Upon release , he and Talmadge decide to make amends . After " Going Straight " , they change their name to " Remington " , made babies , and lead a happy , prosperous life . Presently , while Talmadge and Lewis remorsefully recall their life of crime , Mr . Palette remains crooked to the bone . He hooks up with little Georgie Stone ( as Jimmy ) , a helpless waif and criminal adjunct . When Palette re-encounters his now prosperous pal , he blackmails Lewis by threatening to reveal wife Talmadge's participation in their past crimes . Since Talmadge was never caught , she would ( presumably ) have to serve some years in prison . Eventually , Palette's demands increase . . .

453711	15896852	624855	5.0	Southern Hospitality with Julie Harris	The outlaw " Jamison Gang " , led by Donnelly Rhodes ( as Bob ) , sends Bruce Dern ( as Durkee ) to scout out for Laredo's Rangers . They rightly fear the Rangers will interfere with their plans to pick up a wealth of silver , buried under a farm . Instead of scouting , Mr . Dern turns informer . Rangers Reese ( Neville Brand ) , Chad ( Peter Brown ) , and Joe ( William Smith ) are sent out , by Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) , to confront the Jamison Gang . Along the way , the meet widow Julie Harris ( as Annamay ) , who also wants to claim the silver-enhanced farm ? Ms . Harris is a charming guest star , working very well with Mr . Brand ; in fact , the entire guest cast is exceptional . This episode , which aired fourth in the first season , should have been the series premiere . It features an abundance of the series ' hallmarks : humor and action . And , the characterization either lacking or ill-chosen in earlier episodes begins to form . Reese is noted to have " led on " two women , with undelivered promises of marriage ; this figures , later , into the plot , and conveys the " rule " about the Rangers remaining single . The most interesting bit of characterization occurs when , early in the episode , Chad's lady-killing reputation is confirmed ; skirting the network censors , Brown is discreetly shown being interrupted during a sexual encounter .

452946	15896852	66001	5.0	Piercing the Iron Curtain	Knife-wielding seaman Christopher Jones ( as Leiser ) is recruited , by British spies , to sneak through the Iron Curtain , in Germany ; there , he is to confirm suspicions the East German Communist are building missiles . Mr . Jones ' mission is , at first , complimented by , but later , compromised by the urge to mate ; especially after he encounters delicious Pia Degermark ( as Anna ) . Writer / director Frank Pierson's adaptation of John Le Carré's Cold War novel is , in the end , disappointing ; but , it has some strengths . Shirt-shedding Jones ' Polish-French-English dubbing is very well done . Mr . Pierson's direction holds interest . Jones and Ms . Degermark are very beautiful ; unfortunately , both would have short-lived starring careers . Another promising young performer , Anthony Hopkins ( as Avery ) , makes a good impression ; and , veterans Ralph Richardson and Paul Rogers give the picture some gravitas .

452556	15896852	43071	5.0	The Bowery Boys Meet The Beatles	In a striking opening sequence , Leo Gorcey ( as Slip Mahoney ) , Huntz Hall ( as Horace Debussy " Sach " Jones ) , William " Billy " Benedict ( as Whitey ) , Buddy Gorman ( as Butch ) , and David Gorcey ( as Chuck ) appear in menacing plastic masks , at the " Bowling Green Van & Storage Company " . The police arrive on the scene , and arrest the gang of five for robbing the place - but , they didn't commit the crime . Leader Gorcey and company claim they are celebrating Halloween ( in April ) . To bail out " The Bowery Boys " , Bernard Gorcey ( as Louie Dumbrowsky ) puts up his " Sweet Shop " as collateral ; and , lawyer pal Gabriel Dell ( as Gabriel " Gabe " Moreno ) arrives to defend his old friends . Awaiting trial , Mr . Benedict receives information on the real robbers via his " short wave " radio . Acting on Benedict's lead , Gorcey and Mr . Hall plead " guilty " as charged , so they can investigate the case inside the " state pen " . Hall's " Triple Trouble " performance is especially good . And , there are a great bunch of supporting crooks to watch out for - George Chandler ( as Squirrelly Davis ) , Pat Collins ( as Bat Armstrong ) , Paul Dubov ( as Pretty Boy Gleason ) , and Joe Turkel ( as Benny the Blood ) . Also note , " Bowery Boy " Benedict gets a little more screen time than he's usually allotted . Unfortunately , the story really isn't very interesting . Hall ( " I'll have a ham on rye " ) and Gorcey ( " The proper alliteration is you or me " ) have a courtroom scene which certainly suggests this film may have been seen by Beatles in Liverpool , England . Lennon and McCartney were admirers of Gorcey and Hall - and , in this film , a common sense of humor shows . See if you can identify moments resembling " Magical Mystery Tour " and " Band on the Run " , herein . Later , Hall appeared on The Beatles ' " Sgt . Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band " album collage ( Gorcey was removed after demanding a fee ) . Triple Trouble ( / 50 ) Jean Yarbrough - Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall , William " Billy " Benedict

" Instead , she finds it to be cool , contentious , and chaotic . The recipients of her fruitcakes are unable to hide their disappointment , and Donna has to buy a last minute gift for Alex . Moreover , Mary won't shop until she's sure she'll get a gift in return , and Jeff is keeping a " profit-and-loss ledger " for the year . Donna wonders what happened to the Christmas spirit of giving . She finds answers when she gets to know the generous janitor at the Hilldale Hospital - indeed , very special guest star Buster Keaton ( as Charlie ) . This episode must have endeared Donna and her television family to millions of viewers . It isn't terribly well done , but it isn't terrible . The appearance of Mr . Keaton is a treat . And , the hospital children are very sweet . In their hospital beds , they read a very rare edition of " Captain Marvel Adventures " - the cover is visible , but it doesn't match any cover I could find , web-surfing . Since the comic book ended publication in 1953 , it's strange to see a decent copy last through ( at least ) five years in a children's hospital ( or , TV prop room ) .

452918	15896852	564220	5.0	Shelley Fabares wants Jimmy Hawkins	Donna ( Donna Reed ) realizes daughter Mary ( Shelley Fabares ) has a teenage crush , after she forlornly washes the same dish five times . Indeed , Mary wants to go to the " Varsity Prom " with handsome Jimmy Hawkins ( as George Haskell ) , the basketball star who works in the school library . But , Mary thinks she has " all the sex appeal of a wet mop . " Donna thinks Mary should be " attractive and desirable . " Father Alex ( Carl Betz ) worries about the " desirable " part , and Jeff ( Paul Peterson ) thinks his sister's yen for men is dumb . Donna tries to help Mary out , but young Haskell develops a crush on mother Donna , instead ? The plot is a sitcom staple . No wonder Mr . Hawkins falls for Donna ( a former nurse ) ; she is attractive even when she tries to dress " down " as a haggard housewife . Hawkins and Ms . Fabares are a very cute couple . And , it's easy to see why Hawkins was frequently asked back on " The Donna Reed Show " . Hawkins was Reed's son in " It's a Wonderful Life " ( 1946 ) . Later , he had parts in two of the three movies Fabares did with Elvis Presley , " Girl Happy " ( 1965 ) and " Spinout " ( 1966 ) . Donna's advice to Mary was good , " Build him up and laugh at his jokes . " Change Partners and Dance ( / 58 ) James V . Kern - Donna Reed , Jimmy Hawkins , Shelley Fabares

When Mr . Dean discovers his wife has left New York City , he goes to ask a mutual friend , delicatessen proprietor Rudolph Weiss ( as Poppa Golden ) , where Ms . Riordan might have gone . Dean's tendency for violence surfaces , and he beats the old man up , for advising Riordan to leave town . Dean , also a wife abuser , returns home to father Ted Osborn ( as Fred Harris ) ; happily , he discovers this is where Riordan is living . His wife and father eventually accept Dean declaration he is abandoning his criminal ways . Then , investigator Robert F . Simon ( as Lieutenant Case ) arrives ; unfortunately , Dean's beating victim may die ? This is a disappointing TV-movie drama , due to the expectations raised by the fact that it was written by Rod Serling , and stars James Dean . The story wastes a good deal by having Dean commit his crime at the onset . This makes Dean's character initially unlikable , and unlikely to be redeemed ; and , gives the viewer no chance to evaluate his later lying about the incident . Still , Dean does a great job with the material . He is especially effective in the " nostalgia " scene , hopelessly reminiscing about his past , and chewing his shirt collar nervously over the future . Dean is exceptional , putting great effort in creating the " poet and gangster " character called for in the script . " A Long Time Till Dawn " is , otherwise , rather ordinary .

452678	15896852	624881	5.0	Eve Arden Brings Culture to Laredo	After the " Slaughter Gang " robs a bank in San Sabo , the Rangers capture the bandits , and return their booty to the local bank . There , they meet culture-peddling Eve Arden ( as Miss Em ) , who is refused for a bank loan . Ms . Arden impresses Reese ( Neville Brand ) with her flattery and ladylike manner . Reese , Chad ( Peter Brown ) , and Joe ( William Smith ) devise a plan to help Arden sell tickets to her lecture on culture . To sell tickets , a " hot tamale " from the " Silver Slipper " ( Rita D'Amico as " Carlotta " ) is added to the program . Arden lives this episode up considerably ; and , her character's comic duplicity fits the show like a glove . The story , however , doesn't really rise above that of very ordinary episodic television . At the time , Arden's was a rare and welcome screen appearance . Veterans Myron Healey ( as Sam Bolt ) and Lyle Talbot ( as the Sheriff ) are other notable additions to the " Laredo " guest cast . Lardeo - Which Way Did They Go ?

452505	15896852	37988	5.0	Sometimes Too Subtle & Sometimes Too Obvious	The story is familiar - Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray wishes his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . The sets , direction , and photography are beautiful . Through no fault of their own , the actors ' characters falter - for example ; Angela Lansbury is strikingly beautiful and terrific , but annoyingly sings " Goodbye Little Yellow Bird " ( foreshadowing ? ) , and Hurd Hatfield grows into the role , but annoyingly stabs a table ( more foreshadowing ? ) . Mr . Hatfield ends up impressing , but the film's early going makes it difficult . George Sanders is delicious , as usual . More often than not , the script is way too subtle . Why couldn't the frequent narration help explain things more mysterious , instead of things more obvious ? AND , the switching from " black and white " to " color " is a gimmick that almost worked the first time .

453450	15896852	1088	5.0	Beauty and the Biograph Girl	Florence Lawrence ( as Mabel Jarrett ) lives happily with her parents James Kirkwood and Flora Finch ; while waiting for her suitor Arthur V . Johnson ( as Tom Hearne ) ' s inevitable proposal of marriage . Another member of the household is Mary Pickford ( as Winnie ) , who is not only Ms . Lawrence's cousin , but also her best friend . Lawrence's life is torn asunder when she receives a burn , then scar , on her face , during an electrical accident . She perceives a difference in suitor Johnson's attentions , after he sees her scarred face . Most D . W . Griffith films from the period are notable for their technical innovations ; " The Way of Man " is more notable for the indelible performances Griffith elicits . Lawrence , aka " The Biograph Girl " , is especially memorable in her climactic rocky scene . Johnson is likewise convincing ; he is torn between his love for the scarred Lawrence , and the suddenly more lovely Ms . Pickford . Together , Lawrence and Johnson are an exciting on-screen team . Note how , in an early scene , Johnson kisses and strokes the very part of Lawrence's face which will later be scarred ; it's a Griffith touch that adds a subtle magic to the overall film . Despite its strengths , you have to wonder about " The Way of Man " regarding beauty as depicted in this film . Lawrence's burn does not seriously alter her looks , and Johnson obviously still has feelings for her - - she knows this , and still decides makes her decision - - perhaps , she is slightly crazed . The ending is somewhat refreshingly unexpected , though sudden ( the film becomes more rushed during the later playing time ) .
453664	15896852	42786	5.0	God on the Radio	" You know , " writer George Sumner Albee said , " wouldn't it be something if God would come on the radio and give people such a bad scare they'd wake up and behave themselves ! " That quote appeared in MGM president Dore Schary's book " Case History of a Movie " , which elevated " The Next Voice You Hear ? " far above its station . It also places the " germ " of the story in the days of radio , when the magical medium would be natural place for God to speak to " Joe Smith , American " . So , during the time it was written and filmed , this story must have seemed far less ludicrous . The story focuses on the Smith family : James Whitmore ( as Joe ) , Nancy Davis ( as Mary ) , and Gary Gray ( as Johnny ) . The names " Joseph " and " Mary " have Biblical implications , of course ; and , in the film , " Mary " is pregnant . These facts , like the " voice of God " itself , never progress past the point of mildly intriguing , however . The Smith family proves to be an underwhelming choice to follow , through God's supposed manifestation . Interestingly , the filmmakers combine all the world's Gods into one ; with the implication being that Jews , Muslims , and others hear a similar message . A couple of supporting performers are nice , but Ms . Davis ( later known as Nancy Reagan ) is the best thing in the film . Though a surprisingly thin pregnant woman , she still endeavors to look like she's carrying a child ; and , Davis gives the most realistic performance . She helps the other performers look believable , too , just by appearing on screen with them . For example , it looks like she covers for young Gray , when he almost knocks over a table . And , after a silly " drunk scene " , ending with Mr . Whitmore walking a straight line into EVERY stool on his way out of a bar , Davis ' presence dampens the mediocrity . Davis is genuine in her manner and looks ; she obviously worked on the character , with direction from William A . Wellman . Mr . Wellman keeps it interesting , for the most part ; and , the film provokes some thought . Finally , many at MGM would agree with the observation that God's voice , if heard , would likely sound like Lionel Barrymore ! The Next Voice You Hear ? ( 1950 ) William A . Wellman - James Whitmore , Nancy Davis , Gary Gray
452566	15896852	221027	5.0	Ooo , What a Lucky Man He Was	In early life scenes , Jesse James ( as Young George Jung ) is an ordinary , likable kid . He has a really nice , but unsuccessful in business , father ( Ray Liotta as Fred Jung ) . He has a hellish , selfish mother ( Rachel Griffiths as Ermine Jung ) . He has an overweight friend ( Ethan Suplee as " Tuna " ) . In 1968 , he has grown into Johnny Depp . Mr . Depp and pal " Tuna " move to California . They meet women on the beach , and get stoned . Depp also meets Paul Reubens ( as Derek Foreal ) , who turns him on to selling pot . Depp becomes a HUGE drug dealer . This movie had me going until the switch to California . I was distracted by Depp's different hairstyles . By the 1970s , Depp looked older than his mother . The way people age , and change hairstyles is screwy ; so , is the soundtrack song selection order . Depp's characterization is interesting , at least ; he has my respect for taking chances with his movie roles . Penelope Cruz ( as Mirtha ) lifts things considerably when she appears , but it's a long , long wait . For a film so effective in its " based on a true story " opening , I was surprised so few of the cast seemed to act like they took drugs . Depp performed well , however ; with his scenes hitting bottom , and recovering , being impressive ( see the beating and childbirth scenes ) . Emma Roberts performs very well as the daughter Kristina ; her scenes with Depp make you care about the character . Director Ted Demme was promising , but died shortly after this film . . .

Cooper seeks to become a " conscientious objector " . Older man Cooper has a hankerin ' for nubile young Joan Leslie ( as Gracie Williams ) ; he wants to buy some land and settle down with her , but is drafted . In the United States Army , a sobered and saved Cooper is reluctant to kill nasty Germans , due to his strong Christian beliefs . Can " Uncle Sam " make Cooper a real warrior ? Proximity resulted in this film being elevated far above its ration . When Cooper and his hound dog go to a mountaintop , God helps him reconcile Christianity and killing . At least , Cooper's performance is earnest . Staid Margaret Wycherly ( as Mother York ) , Dickie Moore ( as George York ) , and June Lockhart ( as Rosie York ) keep the home fires burning . She has relatively little to do , but lovely Ms . Lockhart essays the film's most natural performance . Expressive George Tobias ( as Pusher Ross ) , later " Abner Kravitz " on TV's " Bewitched " , provides " comic relief " during wartime . Shucks .

I just watched it , and I don't remember the events preceding the party - Vincent Price is the Satanic host . He makes people act like pigs and other animals . A man in a gorilla suit provides the most gruesome moment . Ex-Beatle bird Jane Asher and David Weston are the young couple in love . This film seems to be making a directorial ( Roger Corman ) statement about something over and above an Edgar Allen Poe story , and I'm not sure what it is supposed to mean . Very colorful and symbolic nothingness is how I would describe . It's almost like you need some written directions . It reminded be of Fellini , Bergman , and The Rock Horror Picture Show ( but not as interesting ) . The Masque of the Red Death ( 1964 ) Roger Corman - Vincent Price , Jane Asher , David Weston
453210	15896852	16308	5.0	Never Gve a Sucker an Even Break	From a modern prospective , this is a most underwhelming film . Carol Dempster ( as Sally ) would seem , athleticism being one of her strengths , to be a natural choice to play a circus performer ; she is , however , mostly unremarkable . W . C . Fields ( as Professor McGargle ) is more graceful ; however , without his distinctive voice , he is somewhat disappointing . And , Alfred Lunt ( as Peyton Lennox ) , known for his brilliant stage presence , is difficult to appreciate . Of the three , Mr . Fields is the most watchable . The breathtaking beauty of earlier D . W . Griffith-directed films is noticeably absent . While some of the shots are lovely , nothing equals the artfulness evident throughout many past Griffith efforts . " Sally of the Sawdust " is beautifully preserved ( if only all Griffith prints were as well preserved ) ; and , it is an enjoyable comedy ( certainly more so in 1925 ) . It was adapted from Dorothy Donnelly's popular play " Poppy " ( 1923 ) , with Madge Kennedy and W . C . Fields . It was re-filmed as " Poppy " ( 1936 ) , with Rochelle Hudson and W . C . Fields . Norma Talmadge's popular film was an altogether different " Poppy " ( 1917 ) , and did not co-star W . C . Fields . Sally of the Sawdust ( 1925 ) D . W . Griffith - Carol Dempster , W . C .

The adults were a known commodity , but children are more of a wild card . Together , " The Football Uniform " and " Change Partners and Dance " show casting Paul Peterson and Shelley Fabares as the Stone children was going to work like a charm .

452531	15896852	16560	5.0	From Pigtails to Curls	In a New Jersey orphanage , pigtailed Marion Davies ( as Mamie Smith ) causes a slapstick ruckus ; consequently , she is brutally abused . Then , Ms . Davies ' luck changes ; and , she is sent to the loving home of motherly Hedda Hopper ( as Edith Caldwell ) . Ms . Hopper's husband is away , on an extended trip to Mexico . So , Davies helps raise Hopper's baby into cute young Jack Huff ( as Alexander " Zander " P . Caldwell Jr . ) . The years are kind to Davies , who grows from freckles and pigtails to beautiful complexion and curls . When Hopper passes away , Davies must fulfill a promise to find Huff's father , but the wicked orphanage from her past declares custody . Davies takes the boy , and sets off to meet adventure , danger , and Harrison Ford . The odd title " Zander the Great " refers to the Greek leader Alexander the Great ; to wit , Davies shortens little Alexander's name to Zander because , " Alexander is such a big name for a weenie baby . " Davies spends the much of the picture made-up like Mary Pickford ( a road taken by many , to be fair ) . The comedy and drama don't mix very well ; as usual , Davies is better with the former . Finally , the movie becomes a western . Director George Hill and the MGM team do some nice work ; especially , the beginning scenes with Davies , and the ending expiration scenes featuring George Siegmann ( as Black Bart ) . The sexual prowess of rabbits is a tiresome source of amusement . This was a big 1923 Broadway success for Alice Brady .

" That problem child , " as Mary ( Shelley Fabares ) describes him , makes up a story about being lonely on his birthday . Of course , Donna arranges for Alex ( Carl Betz ) to pick the boy up , for birthday celebration with the Stones . After Jeff ( Paul Peterson ) gets in trouble for lying ( he shot his " air rifle " haphazardly ) , young Herbert hears Mary say , " People who tell lies don't go to Heaven . " Staying in Jeff's convenient extra bed , Herbert confesses his lie to Jeff , and considers an eternity in Hell . . . Inviting Charles Herbert back on the show was a wise move . This episode , understandably , comes up a little short when compared to the first ; but , Mr . Herbert's little " David " is always welcome . Oscar Rudolph's direction shows some flair , also . The subject matter may seem a little heavy for children watching in 1959 , but writer John Whedon and Ms . Reed lighten up on the prospect of going to Hell for lying .

453582	15896852	1062	5.0	Hats Off to D . W . Griffith	Early film short directed by D . W . Griffith ; it might be more accurately called a " short short " at barely three minutes . It is entertaining , though . The director is saying , " Ladies , please remove your hats ! " Why ? Because you can't match a movie when some woman parks herself in front of your seat , and leaves her HUGE hat on . There are some early silent film stars in attendance - obviously Flora Finch , Linda Arvidson , and Florence Laurence . Mack Sennett is the man with the finny nose and the checkered suit . The men are not easy to identify , with their backs turned ; but , that must be Robert Harron in the lower right of your screen , going crazy over " Those Awful Hats " . The film really MOVES ? all the time , there is movement ALL OVER the screen . Ms . Arvidson recalled , in her autobiography , " How many times that scene was rehearsed and taken ! It grew so late and we were all so sleepy that we stopped counting . But pay for overtime evolved from this picture . " Those Awful Hats ( 1909 ) D . W .

Young is told , after a second miscarriage , she can never have children . Later , she is speeding home , after some event , and hits a child with her car . A truck driver ( also on the road ) takes the boy , and leaves the desperate woman wondering what injuries she's caused . " Paula " begins as a seemingly routine Loretta Young drama , but keep your eye on the picture for a grabber . The story becomes very interesting as circumstances make Young a dramatic hit-and-run driver . The story builds suspense in several ways - - beginning as Young searches for the boy she hit , while the police search for Young . Although it's a great story , the script becomes more and more sentimental - - by the end , it's so maudlin you'll want to scream ( if you're not crying ) . Tommy Rettig is notable as the boy ; in fact , he is Young's co-star . Mr . Rettig also played one of Lassie's famous owners ( Jeff ) . Young and Rettig do well , but they would be even better after a realistic script re-write . The film has some unexpected depth , and raises some interesting crime / punishment questions ; perhaps , its flaws could be addressed in a modern re-make .

" Ask Dad " is a slight , but well-performed , and well-recorded , " talkie " . Mr . Everett Horton performs excellently ; he is obviously prepared for a long and successful career in the talking picture field . Casting Winston as his son was wise ; on screen , the two actors seem to show a circumstantial family resemblance . Winston , who went on to write and produce , was the brother of more famous Patsy Ruth Miller . Renick was a versatile actress from the teens ; like so many , she found good material become rarer with advancing years .

Mr . Fairbanks had essayed a smaller role in " The Martyrs of the Alamo " ; wisely , it was held back until " The Lamb " premiered . This was the first of Fairbanks ' successful Triangle / D . W . Griffith-supervised run of films . It's a good introduction to an amazing silent film career , which ended with " The Iron Mask " ( 1929 ) . Fairbanks is a wealthy " Lovesick Lamb " , head-over-heels for beautiful Seena Owen ( as Mary , " The American Girl " ) . Ms . Owen is set for a big society wedding with woolly Fairbanks ; but , their relationship is threatened by Fairbanks ' timid nature . Owens wishes her " lamb " were more like " Her Model Type of Man " , Alfred Paget ( as " The Goat " ) . So , Fairbanks heads west , to prove his mettle .

They have a few funny lines in " Big Brown Eyes " ; and , along comes Walter Pidgeon with his gang of jewel thieves . The main problem , for me , was the clash between the humor , and the crime drama . The major crime is the accidental shooting of a baby , in its baby carriage , in the park - the scene give you a jolt , and kills the " comedy " . Later , a man is shot after he delivers a witty line . It doesn't mix well . Ms . Bennett and Mr . Grant are the main attraction ; they are fun to watch , and show promise as a movie " team " . I did not care much for the story ( or the slanted camera angles ) , however . Big Brown Eyes ( 1936 ) Raoul Walsh - Cary Grant , Joan Bennett , Walter Pidgeon
453382	15896852	5586	5.0	The Last Card	Western saloon and gambling hall proprietors William S . Hart ( as " Keno " Bates ) and Herschel Mayall ( as " Wind River " ) are robbed , at gunpoint , by Gordon Mullen ( as Jim Maitland ) , after he loses his last cent gambling with Mr . Hart . Hart and Mr . Mayall track Mr . Mullen down , and Hart shoots him dead . On Mullen's body , Hart finds a note announcing the arrival of the deceased's sister , Margaret Thompson ( as Doris Maitland ) . Meeting her stagecoach , Hart feels responsible for the innocent and attractive Ms . Thompson ; he tells her Mullen was more honorably " killed in a mine accident . " Moreover , Keno turns his cabin over to Thompson , saying it belonged to her brother . Romance blossoms ; then , jealous saloon dancer Louise Glaum ( as Anita ) threatens to expose " Keno Bates , Liar " . Reissued as " The Last Card " , this Thomas H . Ince production features a " catfight " between Hart's rivaling women . Regular character player Mayall has a featured role . The shooting of Mullen features some good camera-work ; and , he's a more complex than the usual " villain " , since Hart ( presumably ) hustled the man's money from him . And , Thompson has an amazingly bad aim , unless she intended to only wound her target . Keno Bates , Liar ( / 15 ) William S . Hart - William S . Hart , Herschel Mayall , Margaret Thompson
453009	15896852	86837	5.0	The Sequel Proving Less Is More	" A new time , a new odyssey , a new chance to confront the enigmas arising from the daring Jupiter mission of the year 2001 . Crew members aboard the Leonov are on course to rendezvous with the still orbiting Discovery . What they don't know is that they are equally on course for an uncharted realm of human destiny . And their fate will rest on the silicon shoulders of the computer they awaken , HAL-9000 , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Yes , they reactivate creepy computer HAL , which is one of many instances where this film errs . In the original " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " , HAL ( Douglas Rain ) was mesmerizing . Herein , " his " malfunctions are explained in full ; and , the horror of HAL's malicious presence is figuratively castrated . " 2010 ( The Year We Make Contact " ) takes away so much of the original's mystery and imagination , it is absolutely imperative to see Stanley Kubrick's original " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " ( 1968 ) first . Cold warring American Roy Scheider ( as Heywood Floyd ) and Russian Helen Mirren ( as Tanya Kirbuk ) lead the new mission . Keir Dullea ( as Dave Bowman ) is a welcome supporting actor , and the always dependable Dana Elcar ( as Dimitri Moisevitch ) is a treat . Of the crew , HAL's pal Bob Balaban ( as Dr . Chandra ) provides the most excitement , due to his creepy chemistry with computers . If only the story possessed better foresight ? 2010 ( 1983 ) Peter Hyams - Roy Scheider , Helen Mirren , Keir Dullea
452353	15896852	40000	5.0	Soggy Psychological Drama	Joan Bennett is " The Woman on the Beach " , caught between her blinded husband Charles Bickford and their Lieutenant friend Robert Ryan . Or , maybe not ? I couldn't figure out what was going on , though the actors try their best . The film keeps you wondering what motivates the three principal characters . Far too much is hinted at , and far too vaguely . As far as I'm concerned , the result is unsatisfying . I don't understand the imagery in the beginning , and I certainly can't figure out what I'm supposed to deduce by the ending . Some of what goes on in between is nice looking . You'll wonder , where is the rest the movie ? The Woman on the Beach ( 1947 ) Jean Renoir - Joan Bennett , Robert Ryan , Charles Bickford
452740	15896852	44828	5.0	Going a Little Over the Distance	A little too-standard re-make of the " Cowboys and Indians " western drama ( " The Lost Patrol " , " Sahara " ? ) . It does update the budget - with scenic location camera-work , and interesting direction by Andre De Toth . Broderick Crawford is fine , but seems a little out of place in western gear . Barbara Hale adds feminine charm . Johnny Stewart is fine as the Indian boy ; but , certainly not as mesmerizing as in " Boots Malone " ( 1952 ) . But , there isn't as much potential in this film's parts . Lloyd Bridges looks similarly under-appreciated . " Last of the Comanches " shows a formula getting tired , with not enough newness in the storyline . The production is good , though . The film is bracketed by exciting " Cowboys versus Indians " battles , and there is a lively series of line explosions , in-between . Last of the Comanches ( 1952 ) Andre De Toth - Broderick Crawford , Barbara Hale , Johnny Stewart
452882	15896852	53271	5.0	Charming Young Performers Make This Dog Hunt	Tommy Kirk is a typical teenager ( Wilby ) who gets an ancient ring caught in his trouser cuff . The magical jewel turns him into an on-again / off-again shaggy dog . Mr . Kirk's father Fred MacMurray ( Mr . Wilson ) hates dogs ; little brother Kevin Corcoran ( Moochie ) loves them . This is a Walt Disney movie for kids ; and , it's one to try to enjoy without asking a lot of questions about a very weak plot . The idea is fun , and the " special effect " might have looked very good to young 1959 eyes . Today , it's a movie to watch for the young performances . Kirk is very good as Wilby , effectively giving " The Shaggy Dog " a voice ; he is charming . Tim Considine and Kevin Corcoran are likewise charmers as Kirk's pal and kid brother . Mr . Considine ( as Buzz ) has a terrific scene to watch for - - look for his performance as he tries to put " the make " on fetching neighbor Roberta Shore , on her couch , with rival Wilby watching in dog form ! Also , watch for the always charming Annette Funicello , delightfully bracketing the film as Buzz ' sometimes steady .

Lillian Gish and Walter Miller are the plain , unassuming lovers - they marry , and she has a child . When they go to Town , Temptress Viola Barry spies hunky Mr . Miller , and the dye is cast . She conveniently has car trouble when he is passing by , and begins her seduction . Miller steps out on Ms . Gish , who finds an incriminating glove in Miller's pocket ? and , so on . . . For Griffith and company , " The Mothering Heart " is a bit of a let-down , considering the high quality of the recent " The Burglars's Dilemma " ( 1912 ) and " Death's Marathon " ( 1912 ) . Though everyone works hard , the situation and club flirtation scenes are somewhat silly . The Mothering Heart ( 1913 ) D . W . Griffith - Lillian Gish , Walter Miller , Viola Barry

It's a lot harder than it sounds , because Mr . Harnett vows to give up ALL forms of sexual activity , including masturbation . Promiscuous roommate Paulo Costanzo ( as Ryan ) is around to help ; he examines Hartnett's sheets for fluids , and lets everyone on the Internet know about his pal's pledge . Presumably , Mr . Costanzo orders Hartnett to shower with the door open . Things get very sticky ( or , not ) when women try to arouse Hartnett's interest . To complicate matters , he meets sexy Shannyn Sossamon ( as Erica ) at the Laundromat . Still , Hartnett perseveres . He gets Christian help , in the confessional , from priestly brother Adam Trese ( as John ) ; Mr . Trese is , secretly , struggling with the same vow . Of course , the real story is the discovery , by Hartnett , of " true love " ( instead of just sex ) . Other than a confusing , dream sequence climax ; it's all fairly predictable . Director Michael Lehmann and team succeed in making the premise unrealistic , even for a silly movie . Sossamon and Costanzo are very likable with Hartnett . There are a few laughs . One cool scene features more topless women than " Electric Ladyland " . 40 Days and 40 Nights ( 2002 ) Michael Lehmann - Josh Hartnett , Shannyn Sossamon , Paulo Costanzo

But when federal agent Tobin Keller ( Sean Penn ) investigates her claim and digs deeper into Silvia's dangerous past , he begins to question whether she is a victim - or a suspect ? " Notable for being filmed inside the elusive United Nations building , and for being its famed director's last feature film . Catherine Keener ( as Dot Woods ) manages to make her sadly underdeveloped character more interesting than the leads . " The Interpreter " is well-produced , with a highlighted bus ride . And , it does answer the question : How could a Sydney Pollack film , shot on location in New York , with Sean Penn , be dull ?

452806	15896852	46806	5.0	Sky Pilot	World War II veteran William Holden ( as Harry Brubaker ) isn't sure he wants to return to service as the United States of America battles Communist expansion in Korea ; although , Fredric March ( as George Tarrant ) is very convincing . With the support of glamorous wife Grace Kelly ( as Nancy Brubaker ) and pal Mickey Rooney ( as Mike Forney ) , Mr . Holden agrees to participate in a dangerous mission - - he will attempt to blow up " The Bridges at Toko-Ri " , a Communist stronghold . Mark Robson directs his starry cast well . The ending is especially exciting , albeit getting there is rather dull . Rooney helps to keep it from getting too boring ; and , he helps mend fences with the Japanese . Ms . Kelly punctuates the regal , top-o'-the-line production values ; noticeably , she is barely around . Holden's portrayal is a little ambiguous , while Mr . March is very dutiful . March's character should know the answer to his question , " Where do we get such men ? " since he has a front row seat .
452642	15896852	16480	5.0	A New Testament for the Indian Race	Film adaptation of Zane Grey's western story " The Vanishing American " ; once upon a time ; this was considered a very sympathetic " History of the Indian Race " . Presently , it's worth is much more subjective ; it would be entirely appropriate for modern viewers to take offensive , especially Native Americans . The film's highlight is the opening prologue ; for its time , a very nicely researched , and extraordinarily photographed , history of Native Americans . Edgar Schoenbaum and Harry Perry are the cinematographers capturing Monument Valley , the Grand Canyon , and other places looking exquisitely beautiful . Some of the footage seems excitingly authentic , for example , the " Cliff Dwellers " segments . As the film jumps to the present , Richard Dix ( as Nophaie the Warrior ) emerges as the " hero " ; arguably , he neither looks nor acts like a real Native American . The " epic " story becomes a decidedly more boring tale involving horse thief Noah Berry ( as Booker ) . There is a lovely white woman , of course , to turn Dix ' head ; she's Lois Wilson ( as Marion Warner ) . Ms . Wilson also converts Mr . Dix to Christianity ; and , he is certainly not a hard sell .

Gloria Swanson ( as Beth Gordon ) is his virtuous , but bored , wife ; she is likes to sew and is concerned for the " starving millions in Europe . " Bebe Daniels ( as Sally Clark ) is an attractive young widow who models for the " Mansion Chic " ; she will rock the Gordon marriage ! The cat ( as Toodles ) and Theodore Kosloff ( as the violinist ) are fun to watch . Also fun is Ms . Daniels making herself attractive to her old acquaintance ( of her father ) by putting a heart decal on her shoulder ; her pursuit of wavy-haired men is boldly interesting . Ms . Swanson dolling herself up to win back her man , and the women cat fighting , are amusing scenes . You have to sympathize with Mr . Meighan , aghast at the ludicrous fashions on display in this movie ; the women's lingerie and bathing suits are freakishly unbelievable ! There is nothing terribly outstanding about " Why Change Your Wife " , when compared with other DeMille fare from the time period . As a DeMille production , it rises above mediocrity , of course ; it was inevitable that more domestic gripes would be filmed , as the box office demanded . Why Change Your Wife ( 1920 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Thomas Meighan , Gloria Swanson , Bebe Daniels
452762	15896852	16028	5.0	Arrested Development	New York City slum lass Mary Pickford ( as Annabelle " Little Annie " Rooney ) has a 12-year-old's girlish crush on William Haines ( as Joe Kelly ) , who becomes the suspect in a too-close-for-comfort murder . " Little Annie Rooney " is a well-produced film ; however , Pickford's " little girl " characterization does not fit the slummy story . The film begins with Pickford in a protruded fight with fellow street children , throwing bottles , bricks , and fists at each other . Apparently , this is meant to show Pickford as a " tomboy " character ; but , frankly , she appears insultingly retarded . Pickford's pouting performance is more cloying than convincing , through most of the film . A well-intentionally diverse cast provides some cringe worthy moments ; for example , Pickford spoon-feeding Spec O'Donnell's " Abie Levy " character some ham . Gordon Griffith ( as Tim Rooney ) is another notable co-star ; his mother Katherine was the fine supporting actress seen in Pickford's " Pollyanna " . Director William Beaudine re-teamed with his star for the superior " Sparrows " ( 1926 ) .
453144	15896852	33902	5.0	More Boys in the Hood	More " Boys Town " fun from director Norman Taurog and company ; including Spencer Tracy as the good Priest , and Mickey Rooney as Bad Boy ( turned good ) . Mr . Tracy continues to fight for his homes for " Delinquent Boys " ; Mr . Rooney begins to fight for wayward boys , too , proving the Priest's theories work . Again , Tracy makes a good case for nurture over nature . Again , the film suffers through mugging slapstick , and oversentimentality . It's difficult to take the movie seriously after the slow-motion fight scene . Larry Nunn steals the film , with a more consistent performance than Spencer Tracy ! Mickey Rooney ! and Bobs Watson ! If you must take another trip to " Boys Town " , watch Larry Nunn as " Ted " turn in a fine performance amid all the overacting and underplaying .

452606	15896852	119734	5.0	A Simple Twist of Fate	As a little boy , Jude Law ( as Danny Kowalski ) , helped deliver a baby . Because his hand was small , young " Danny " ( Cory Buck ) was able to reach in , and uncurl the umbilical cord from around the neck of the baby . So , the baby girl is born healthy ; and , the little boy , who will grow up to be Jude Law , declares , " I'm gonna marry her . " Twenty-five years later , Law returns to Los Angeles , from an education in London . He loses his girlfriend , and has trouble finding employment ; he's a tile artist . Then , while delivering a cake , he returns to the house where he long ago delivered the baby ; she has grown into beautiful Gretchen Mol ( as Anna Swan ) . Law falls madly in love with Ms . Mol , and wants to fulfill his childhood pledge to marry her ; but , she is pledged to another man . Swan family matriarch Brenda Blethyn ( as Grace Swan ) enables womb-reaching Law to become a employee / companion to the family ; but , despite his close quarters , he finds Mol a tough love-nut to crack . Law is a very likable leading man , but his romantic interest in , and rapport with , Mol is nil . He might have been better off considering Martha Plimpton ( as Karen Swan ) . The most entertaining relationship occurs between blind sister Jennifer Tilly ( as Nina Swan ) and Spanish savior Vincent Laresca ( as Jesus ) . By the way , they meet in a nightclub where males are stabbed for refusing accept an invitation to dance ; still , the place is crowded . Director / writer Charlie Peters includes many references to Tolstoy's " Anna Karenina " . Julian Lennon's " Day After Day " leads off a sweet soundtrack . In short , the leading relationship would have been more interesting with Ms . Plimpton as " Anna " . Ms . Blethyn and Mr . Laresca contribute strong supporting characterizations .

But fellow " East Side Kid " Bobby Jordan ( as Danny Lyons ) takes Mr . Gorcey's place , and wins the fight . Gorcey is convinced Mr . Jordan , who is dating his sister , had him waylaid on purpose . To make matters worse , Jordan wins a TKO over Gorcey in " The East Side Amateur Jitterbug Contest " , with pretty partner Pamela Blake ( as Ivy McGinnis ) . This is a poorly scripted entry in " The East Side Kids " series . Gorcey's " Muggs " veers too far away from his established character ; especially , in the way he treats Jordan's " Danny " ; yet , Gorcey and Jordan perform the roles well enough to make it work . The jitterbugging contest , with Huntz Hall ( as Glimpy McGleavey ) and his TALL partner , is a highlight . To beef up the team , Benny Bartlett ( as Bennie Miller ) and David Durand ( as Joe " Skinny " Collins ) join returning Ernest Morrison ( as Scruno Jackson ) and Bobby Stone ( as Harold " Stoney " Stone ) . The film ends on a patriotic note . Kid Dynamite ( / 43 ) Wallace Fox - Bobby Jordan , Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall

Although the two ( separately ) realize drunken bumpkin doctor Charles Winninger's diagnosis is in error , they go along with the ruse . Ms . Lombard wants to leave Vermont , the land of " yup " and " nope " , for the excitement of New York City ; and , Mr . March wants to make Lombard's sob story a media sensation . Wanna bet the two fall in love ? " Nothing Sacred " offers a great cast and crew ; some of it is exceptionally well-written ( Ben Hecht is sharply observant ) , but this film has not aged well . Most obviously , its heavy-handed racist and stereotypical characterizations are more annoying than endearing . Classic " screwball " comedies looked better in " black & white " ; and , while it's certainly a welcome variation , the Technicolor seems out of place . Is nothing scared ? Lombard , usually considered an actress to photograph in " black & white " , took a role thought of as for Janet Gaynor , who had just showed she looked great in color ( " A Star Is Born " ) . In " Nothing Scared " , Lombard is photographed well most of the time , but not always . Certainly , she performs the part exceptionally , however . Behind the scenes , director William Wellman maneuvers the color cameras with style . The supporting cast is illustrious . Nothing Sacred ( 1937 ) William A .

To get his share of the bucks , Mr . Dillon must either sell his beloved Corvette , or marry off his alimony-collecting wife . If Dillon can find " Mr . Wonderful " for ex-wife Annabella Sciorra ( as Leonora " Lee " DeMarco ) , he can stop payments . Making her ex-husband's job more challenging , Ms . Sciorra has hooked up with married college Professor William Hurt ( as Tom ) . Sciorra has returned to school , and is learning Latin . Meanwhile , Dillon is dating sexy nurse Mary-Louise Parker ( as Rita ) . This Anthony Minghella film will be very disappointing if you're looking for anything approaching the caliber of " The English Patient " or " The Talented Mr . Ripley " . As good as they are , director Minghella and his bickering leads , do simply nothing with this ordinary , predictable story . There are a few nice moments , like a young downs syndrome couple sneaking a kiss as NYC subway light flicker . But , It's difficult to believe Sciorra suddenly dating the series of men recommended by Dillon . And , it's hard to fathom Dillon giving up a woman as desirable and intelligent as the gainfully employed Nurse Parker ( a part filmmakers should have considered making an " airhead " ) . Second-stringers , like Parker and Con Edison worker David Barry Gray ( as Pope ) , are more interesting to watch than the stars . Mr .

Fugit gets a job at " Kamikaze Pizza " ( good to know there is pizza after death ) . Fugit meets various and sundry suicide victims . Of the individuals he meets , you should consider three highly significant : Shea Whigham ( as Eugene ) , Shannyn Sossamon ( as Mikal ) , and Tom Waits ( as Kneller ) . As a truly fine overdose hopeful , Ms . Sossamon is very easy to fall in love with . A mostly humorless " Wizard of Oz in Purgatory " road trip . Nick Offerman , appearing as a battle-scarred police officer , has the only really funny moment . The title " Wristcutters " either shouldn't be plural , or the term is being used as a synonym for all those suicidal ; and , the subtitle " A Love Story " really gives up the ghost . Although obvious , the film and ( especially ) Sossamon are satisfying enough . Wristcutters ( 2006 ) Goran Dukic - Patrick Fugit , Shannyn Sossamon , Shea Whigham

So , he has second thoughts . Mr . Harnett decides to track down Ms . Kruger . So , he runs into ravenous Rose Byrne ( as Alex ) . Matthew Lillard ( as Luke ) is a pleasant on-screen pal .

453663	15896852	38163	5.0	Funny as a Crutch	Wallace Beery ( as Ned Trumpet ) is a World War II blimp aviator ; his unbelievable war stories have helped earn him the nickname " Old Gas Bag " . Though he was never a husband or ( presumably ) father , Mr . Berry's stories include bragging about the exploits of his talented son ; probably , this is to compete with bickering Navy man James Gleason ( as Jimmy Shannon ) . In one of an unbelievable series of happenstances , Berry meets an fatherless young man , Tom Drake ( as Jess Weaver ) , who makes an ideal son . Trouble is , Mr . Drake's character is unable to walk without crutches ; so , the crippled man doesn't match the son in Berry's stories . While the film scores points for the inclusion of a disabled character ; ultimately , it presents the condition as unworkable . Certainly , Mr . Drake's disability provided him with heroics enough too impress Berry and his Navy friends . The dramatics are highlighted by a couple of exciting battles involving Berry's war blimp ; the Japanese submarine attack is particularly good . The best comic scenes are near the end ; when , in India , Berry is reunited with a friendly old elephant .

Carter Duryea ( Topher Grace ) , a young hotshot half his age , has just become his boss . And to complicate matters , Dan discovers Carter is dating his daughter ( Scarlett Johansson ) . It's filled with genuine laughs and you're in good company when you watch this entertaining comedy that ' Rolling Stone ' calls ' hilarious ' , " according to the DVD sleeve . " Rolling Stone " is wrong ; the humor in this film not " hilarious " . Although he tries , Mr . Quaid can't make lines like " Only my wife is allowed to touch me there ! " funny , and Mr . Grace's borderline kid / adult talk is just embarrassing . The dorm poster advertising : " Marijuana ( Because Your Friends Just Aren't Very Funny ) " may be good advice , concerning the comedy part of this comedy / drama . Writer / director Paul Weitz and his cast do much better with the dramatic portions , which take over by the third act . Although , by then , it's too little , too late . When Quaid and Grace hug , you wonder where the good story went . It should have ended with Quaid receiving the son he wanted , but in an unexpected way ?

452693	15896852	49388	5.0	Julie Do Ya Love Me ?	This film should have been better , with Doris Day and Louis Jourdan showing promise as the " terrified wife on the run from deranged husband . " I did not care for the gasping , breathless , overly dramatic voiceovers from Ms . Day - I can't believe they asked her to do these ; they spoil the dramatic acting performance on the visible screen . Mr . Jourdan is fun as the psycho husband , but he is give some silly stalking things to do - like , he sets off a tape recorder of his manic piano playing in a car outside Ms . Day's window ? Imagine what Alfred Hitchcock would have given Jourdan and Day to do ! The ending doesn't work for me - I would have liked , instead , a suspenseful confrontation between Day and Jourdan to end the film ; perhaps , with them alone in the cockpit - having a dramatic confrontation while the fate of the airplane's passengers hangs in the balance !

Ms . Murray decides to apply for a job as hostess and dancer at the " Peach Tree Inn " managed by William Mong ( as Larry McKean ) . In order to clinch the job , Murray pretends to be infamous dancer Gloria De Moin . Murray is also the only dancer available to hire , as all of the other applicants walk out . Randy Rudolph Valentino ( as Jimmy Calhoun ) is a " Peach Tree Inn " patron who becomes enamored with Murray - he wants to marry her , but his wealthy father is wary . Meanwhile , Bertram Grassby ( as Duke de Sauterne ) returns to complicate matters ; he was involved with the real Gloria De Moin , and is on the lam from the law ? Handsome Valentino and smarmy Grassby are the highlight of the film , which picks up considerably whenever the two strut their stuff over Murray . Otherwise , the story is uninteresting , and the comedy doesn't work . Unfortunately , the film is " speeded up " - possibly , this is done to enhance its comedy effect ; instead , it can make you dizzy , or put you to sleep . " The Delicious Little Devil " is not the place start , if you want to appreciate silent films fully . The Delicious Little Devil ( 1919 ) Robert Z .

453039	15896852	20691	5.0	John Wayne as a Pilgrim	Handsome young John Wayne ( as Breck Coleman ) helps settle the great American West by serving as scout for a pioneer wagon train . An expert trailblazer , Mr . Wayne was trained by good Indians . With Wayne's help , the travelers overcome both bad weather , and bad Indians . Bad acting is not so lucky . Along the way , Wayne falls for fetching young Marguerite Churchill ( as Ruth Cameron ) . Another attempting to catch Ms . Churchill's eye is dressed-in-black gambler Ian Keith ( as Bill Thorpe ) . This creaky film is , of course , most significant as Wayne's first shot at a starring role . Seeing this film confirms the " real " John Wayne premiered in " Stagecoach " ( 1939 ) - the difference is amazing . Raoul Walsh's " The Big Trail " is most impressive in its wide-screen photography , advanced by the director and photographer Arthur Edeson . Lucien Andriot's work is also good . The rest of the cast is interesting , at least ; with stage star Tyrone Power Sr . ( as Red Flack ) leading the charge , in his only " talkie " appearance .

452560	15896852	49143	5.0	Three Cheers for Bernard Gorcey , Raymond Hatton , and Carl Switzer	In a noticeably well-performed ( and uncredited ) opening , former " Our Gang " member Carl " Alfalfa " Switzer ( as Shifty Robertson ) arrives at Bernard Gorcey ( as Louie Dumbrowsky ) ' s ice cream parlor and sweet shop , after being " found " by Huntz Hall ( as Horace Debussy " Sach " Jones ) . Promising they will be millionaires , Mr . Switzer sells Leo Gorcey ( as Terrence Aloysius " Slip " Mahoney ) and " The Bowery Boys " his uranium mine . The deed is placed in the senior Gorcey's name ( as he put up the $500 ) . Of course , the trio , plus secondary " Bowery Boys " David " Condon " Gorcey ( as Chuck ) and Benny " Bennie " Bartlett ( as Butch ) , don't know they've been flimflammed - but , the land proves to be more valuable than originally thought ? This was the last appearance of Bernard Gorcey ( father of Leo and David ) ; sadly , he died following a car accident , just before the release of " Dig That Uranium " . The elder Gorcey performs well herein , and had become the most valuable supporting player in " The Bowery Boys " series . Leader of the pack Leo Gorcey would only last only one more film , which was thought to be due to his father's death ; however , it appears he might be having problems , even now ( before " Crashing Las Vegas " ) . Carl Switzer ( a murder victim in 1959 ) performs his opening so well , it's a shame he wasn't asked to work more often . Earlier , Switzer worked with present " Bowery Boy " Bartlett and former " Dead End Kid " Billy Halop in the " East Side Kids " imitation " Gas House Kids " gang . Raymond Hatton ( as Hank ' Mac ' McKenzie ) and the rest of the cast provide more reasons to watch an otherwise mediocre movie .

452616	15896852	164003	5.0	Matt Dillon Soaks Up Local Cambodia	" After a bogus insurance scam sparks an FBI investigation , front man Jimmy Cremmins flees to Cambodia to meet his mentor , Marvin . But Jimmy gets more than he bargained for when - against a backdrop of raw , dangerous beauty and ever-shifting loyalties - Marvin draws him into a web of deceit and murder from which there may be no way out ! , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Matt Dillon promisingly joins the multi-tasking actor ranks , as the director , star , and co-writer of " City of Ghosts " . The film's main strength is its striking Southeast Asian scenery . Mr . Dillon and photographer Jim Denault make Cambodia look darkly beautiful , with the film's soundtrack music helping to set the mood . Father figuring James Caan ( as Marvin ) , cool blonde Natascha McElhone ( as Sophie ) , and baby wielding Gérard Depardieu ( as Emile ) try to keep up with Kem Sereyvuth ( as Sok ) and the local crowd . Stellan Skarsgård ( as Joseph Kaspar ) is a stand-out . Unfortunately , he story is relatively weak . City of Ghosts ( 2002 ) Matt Dillon - Matt Dillon , James Caan , Stellan Skarsgård
453441	15896852	16643	5.0	Horsing Around with the Other Chaplin	Syd Chaplin ( as " Old Bill " Busby ) and Jack Ackroyd ( as Little " Alfie " ) are World War I servicemen ; while being bombarded , in a foxhole , Mr . Chaplin tells Mr . Ackroyd , " If you knows of a better ' ole - - go to it . " This exchange gives the film its peculiar title . The characters are based on the ( by now ) obscure British cartoon comic " Old Bill " , by Bruce Bairnsfather . Seeing the familiar characters brought to the screen might have made the opening scenes delightful , but they no longer entertain . Veterans ( of film ) Edgar Kennedy ( as Austin ) and Harold Goodwin ( as Bert Chester ) help make the early going bearable . Ackroyd's stabbing of Chaplin as he sleeps under a bale of hay begins some intermittently good scenes . Chaplin's chair lifting ability amazes , and the Chaplin / Ackroyd team becomes funnier as the comedy progresses ; they are most delightful as " two-men-in-a-horse " . The production levels offered by Warner Brothers are quite high ; " The Better ' Ole " was the second film to make use of the studio's synchronized music and sound effects " Vitaphone " process . With a certain British sibling named " Charlie " experiencing a " Gold Rush " at the box office , it's easy to understand Warner's effort .
453248	15896852	7272	5.0	Wherefore Art Thou , Romeo ?	A synopsis reveals this to be a faithful adaptation of Shakespeare's " Romeo and Juliet " . Film historian Anthony Slide reported the only significant difference being , " Rosaline , the girl of whom Romeo is enamored before meeting Juliet , is shown , not merely talked about . " In his early 30s , Francis X . Bushman might seem a little too old , by present standards , to be playing " Romeo Montague " ; but , audiences in 1916 couldn't have cared less . As one of the most popular leading men from the era , Mr . Bushman would have been a natural casting choice . Immensely popular , Bushman was in the " Top Ten " of the decade's " Motion Picture Magazine " favorites lists : star # 4 in 1912 , # 6 in 1913 , # 10 in 1914 , # 3 performance of 1915 in " Graustark " , star # 3 ( and # 1 male ) in 1916 , # 2 ( and # 1 male ) in 1917 , and # 10 in 1918 . Popular co-star , probable off-screen lover , and future Mrs . Bushman , beautiful Beverly Bayne was " Juliet " . This film competed with a the near-simultaneous release of box office rival Theda Bara's version . If only the two had performed " Romeo and Juliet " in the same film , and had it survive the ages ?

453143	15896852	35959	5.0	Just Your Average Joe	Spencer Tracy plays a World War II pilot who isn't just killed , but demolished , in the exciting opening of " A Guy Named Joe " . He goes to a Heavenly place ( with Lionel Barrymore in charge ) . There , he is given his Real Wings - he is to return to earth and be Van Johnson's " Guardian Angel " . In the process , he has to deal with Mr . Johnson hooking up with his ex ( Irene Dunne ) . The Victor Fleming-directed movie doesn't do anything to differentiate the ghostly Mr . Tracy from the Earthbound players . The story is propagandistic and illogical . But , the production looks nice , and the performances are worthy .

453301	15896852	42634	5.0	Loretta and Clark in Mayoral Scandal	Clark Gable and Loretta Young look MGM production perfect as they play two Mayors who meet at a convention in San Francisco . Mr . Gable is the rough one , ex-longshoreman Steve Fisk . Ms . Young is the softer focused Clarissa Standish . The well-named twosome clash , of course , during the Mayoral proceedings - but , can romance be far behind ? It's an average film for the two stars . Recommended scenes : the " Balloon Dance " woman who loses most of her balloons , and the " Barroom Brawl " which follows . All that gets Young in trouble with her constituents . Notable also as Frank Morgan's final film . Gable tussles Mr . Morgan's hair . Key to the City ( 1950 ) George Sidney - Clark Gable , Loretta Young , Frank Morgan
452779	15896852	47030	5.0	I'll Have Another Miller	The bloom is off the rose of the Stewart / Allyson partnership from " The Stratton Story " ( 1949 ) . They still have a nice screen rapport , but no are scenes as good as in their initial effort . Instead , the sad events in the Millers ' life seem to be accompanied by a cheerful tear and stiff upper lip ; for example , watch how they handle not having children . You definitely get a sense of the importance of the subject , musician Glenn Miller ; but , you also get a sneaking suspicion this is a VERY glossed over production . The dancers during one of Miller's most exciting numbers aren't even as excited as the elderly dancers on an old " Lawrence Welk Show " rerun . There are some serious editing / continuity distractions - worse , they are so obvious they spoil the important scene when Mrs . Miller and friends listen to the Christmas program . The filmmakers practically hit you over the head with how its going to end ; if you don't know , you'll easily guess . This one should be good for fans of Mr . Miller , Mr . Stewart , and Ms . Allyson ; but , I'd like to see a more accurate Glenn Miller film story . The Glenn Miller Story ( 1954 ) Anthony Mann - James Stewart , June Allyson , Harry Morgan
452977	15896852	163978	5.0	Paradise Costs	Bangkok-bound Leonardo DiCaprio ( as Richard ) drinks six beers during his airplane flight . After landing , the adventure-seeking Mr . DiCaprio drinks snake blood , as a chaser . Then , " Daffy " acquaintance Robert Carlyle meets an unexpected , bloody demise , leaving DiCaprio a map , which is supposed to lead him to a secret island paradise . DiCaprio invites a sexually active young French couple , Virginie Ledoyen ( Françoise ) and Guillaume Canet ( Etienne ) , to accompany him . They find Carlyle's map leads to " The Beach " , a community of " beautiful people " in eternal vacation mode . Soon , DiCaprio finds his life complicated by affairs with the feminine half of his invited twosome , and the older woman who manages the island community , lady dictator Tilda Swinton ( as " Sal " ) . Danny Boyle's " The Beach " spends its first half being pretty , but vacuous . After a graphic shark attack , it turns more bloody , but only slightly less vacuous .

453649	15896852	75213	5.0	John Wayne's Last Shot	Notorious western gunslinger John Wayne ( as J . B . Brooks ) is dying of cancer . He receives some painkilling medicine from friendly old doctor James Stewart ( as E . W . Hostetler ) . Then , Mr . Wayne rents a room from Lauren Bacall ( as Bond Rogers ) ; there , he hopes to die ( God willing ) as peacefully as possible . Ms . Bacall has a son , Ron Howard ( as Gillom Rogers ) , who has a hankerin ' for notorious western gunslingers ? The film opens nicely , with a slightly older " Opie Taylor " narrating over scenes from superior westerns from Wayne's past . These tie Wayne's " Shootist " character in with the old Wayne persona ; at least , it's a blended memory of the older western roles Wayne played - - from Red River ( 1948 ) to El Dorado ( 1966 ) . The character Wayne plays does not compare favorably with the older roles , however . The director , cast , and storyline make " The Shootist " a sentimental undertaking , as it is Wayne's last film ; eventually , he would die from cancer ( unlike the character in this film , incidentally ) . Actor Wayne and director Don Siegel have some good moments , and Bacall does very well . The sets and locale are lovely . Mr . Howard is a little tough to take as a ( presumably ) teenager idolizing Wayne . The ending , with Wayne and Howard in some cathartic moment , does not work . It's weird to see Wayne stick a gun in " Morning Appeal " reporter Richard Lenz ' mouth , and order him to suck . Soon after , he kicks him . Even weirder is the scene where Wayne goes to get a shave and haircut in the local Barber Shop . You never see the barber cut into his hair . In fact , Wayne looks no more " trimmed " than when he went in - - but the barber sweeps up a bunch of silver hair anyway , after finding a piece on Wayne's vest .

453257	15896852	249478	5.0	Father Figures	Fair-minded boat builder John Travolta ( as Frank Morrison ) takes time out to attend teenaged son Matt O'Leary ( as Danny Morrison ) ballgames . But , young O'Leary is more likely to be found at the Southport jail - he's having trouble accepting snarky rich Vince Vaughn ( as Rick Barnes ) , who quickly marries his divorced mom , Teri Polo ( as Susan ) . O'Leary is further alienated when he learns step-father Vaughn has impregnated Ms . Polo . Distressed , he stows away on a car ride with Vaughn , to the " Shady Tree Motel " . There , Vaughn picks up skuzzy ex-pal Steve Buscemi ( as Ray Coleman ) . O'Leary witnesses a murder , but not even Travolta will believe him ? Harold Becker's " Domestic Disturbance " provides a fair amount of suspense ; but , it's not the " edge of your seat thriller " promised in the film's promotional material . The characterizations suffer , in a loose , contrived script . Travolta , for example , goes from sleuth ? to disbelief in his son ? to certainty ? and , back to sleuthing . Vaughn is obviously villainous , and O'Leary is obviously sincere ( in his first feature film ) - poor Polo sure takes an extraordinary amount of time sorting them out .

After becoming a mother , Ms . Chatterton tries to go straight ; but , she is unable to support a child . Chatterton partners up with Louis Calhern ( as Steve Dutton ) ; and , they prosper in prostitution and bootlegging . Mr . Calhern also provides a legitimate home for Chatterton's son , who grows into a football star and , later , a successful district attorney . Grown-up son Donald Cook ( as Dan Reynolds ) doesn't know about his mother's life of crime . Will their paths cross ? A " star vehicle " for Chatterton ; " Frisco Jenny " is , otherwise , unsatisfying . Chatterton and the cast are entertaining , though ; and , she performs especially well during the film's final scenes . During the trial , William A . Wellman's direction is somewhat dizzying . And , why does Chatterton save money , for years , to pay back Calhern - after all , she went to jail to cover for him ! Frisco Jenny ( / 32 ) William A .

Rookie ( read : the young dude ) Josh Hartnett ( as K . C . Calden ) sidelines as a yoga teacher who really wants to be an actor . Mr . Ford likes to listen to Smokey Robinson , who appears as a cab driver . Mr . Hartnett yells " Stella !

Hartnett beds various women , and eats bean sprouts . " Police detectives are different in Hollywood , " they say . . . Ron Shelton's " Hollywood Homicide " involves Ford and Hartnett investigating rap murder . Ms . Olin and Bruce Greenwood ( as Bennie Macko ) are strong supporting players . Fair to middling appearances are offered by Gladys Knight ( not singing ) , Lou Diamond Phillips ( gunning for Eddie Murphy ) , Mr . Robinson ( a Miracle ) , Frank Sinatra Jr . ( the son of ) , and Robert Wagner ( in wet cement ) . Despite the involvement of some real rappers , the hip-hop music angle doesn't ring authentically . And , the film never finds the comic groove it's so obviously seeking . Things pick up toward the end , if you want to cut to the chase .

453247	15896852	6568	6.0	The Million Dollar Mermaid	A detailed synopsis of Herbert Brenon's lost spectacular can be easily found ( presently ) by searching " A Daughter of the Gods " and " Library of Congress " . Before that , the film's program expressed its fantastical content , " The Prologue : The plaything of a little child escapes its earthly prison . And thereby hangs a tale of many years ago . Act One : The land of a Mighty Sultan , and a record of many strange happenings there . A Fairy Prince and Princess Meet . Act Two : Wherein we all become children again and fight for a beautiful Princess . The land of the Great Beyond . The Fairy Prince and Princess meet again , never to be parted . " " A Daughter of the Gods " was shot in Jamaica , and cost over a million dollars to make . It was the second successful collaboration for acclaimed director Herbert Brenon and aquatic superstar Annette Kellerman ( herein , playing Princess Anitia ) . Although several reviewers reported it to be " stodgy " and too long ( Brenon called it " three enchanting hours " ) , over several years ( and reissues ) , it must have eventually recouped its cost . " Tasteful " nude scenes , exposing the conveniently long-haired Ms . Kellerman's naked form , must have helped cause the sensational box office .

453558	15896852	2197	6.0	Friends and Lovers	Early film directed by D . W . Griffith ; it stars Mary Pickford as an upstairs saloon girl who has a great time with dandy patron Henry B . Walthall . Then , he leaves her for business opportunities up " north . " Ms . Pickford is devastated , of course . On his way of town , Mr . Walthall meets old friend Lionel Barrymore , who is on his way in town . Ironically , his friend's abandoned girl catches Mr . Barrymore's eye . Later , Walthall returns ? Classic plot involving two " Friends " in love with the same girl . Pickford and her suitors play it quaintly . The film endeavors to show the lasting friendship between men Walthall and Barrymore . Yet , Pickford steals the theme - making it more a study of her character's sacrifice . Friends ( 1912 ) D . W . Griffith - Mary Pickford , Henry B . Walthall , Lionel Barrymore
452639	15896852	2176	6.0	Womankind Overcomes Man's Vagary	Subtitled " A Psychological Tragedy " , this one's about four survivors of a deserted mining camp making their way across a hot and windy western desert . Claire McDowell leads the group ; alongside her are : her ailing husband Charles West , and her sister Mary Pickford . Before leaving , Ms . McDowell invites abandoned woman Dorothy Bernard to join the group ; and , she gratefully accepts . As they journey , Mr . West's health falters , and Ms . Bernard is rebuffed for showing him some possible affection . At their first rest stop , lady leader McDowell takes Ms . Pickford out to fetch some water , leaving husband West alone with the comely Bernard . Pickford has already begun to suspect Bernard is making advances on her brother-in-law , and persuades her sister to sneak back and catch the twosome . Sure enough , they discover Bernard and West trysting - however , it was West who initiated the contact , not the suspected Bernard . After West dies of his ailments , McDowell and Pickford become obsessed with vengeance , disbelieving the innocent Bernard ? A atmospherically visual treat from D . W . Griffith , G . W . Bitzer and the good folks at Biograph ; " The Female of the Species " is filmed in warm and windy California . The performances of the lead actresses McDowell , Pickford , and Bernard are outstanding . The story is not up to snuff , however - the " womankind " strengths are unbalanced by some odd motivations and situations . Perhaps the most implausible moment occurs when husband West's " dominant vagary " temporarily cures whatever is ailing him , so he can vigorously attack his alluring prey . Obviously , somebody needed to bottle vagary ! The Female of the Species ( / 12 ) D . W . Griffith - Claire McDowell , Mary Pickford , Dorothy Bernard
453659	15896852	23878	6.0	Love Is in the Air	Although they are not at their relative best in this rather routine drama , actor Richard Barthelmess ( as Jim Blaine ) and director William A . Wellman make " Central Airport " worth visiting . Mr . Barthelmess is in a familiar role as an accident prone World War I pilot . He catches Sally Eilers ( as Jill Collins ) hanging from a tree , after a parachute drop . This funny / sad sequence , early in the film , is a highlight - - Ms . Eilers and Barthelmess have a great meeting , which is immediately followed by great tragedy . Although the two fall in love , Barthelmess won't marry ; he thinks daredevil pilots are unstable husband material ( a keen observation ) . Instead , Eilers marries Barthelmess ' little brother Tom Brown ( as Bud Blaine ) . Eilers appears in a far too brief scene in her slip , by the way ( about 30 minutes into the running ) . Later on , an interesting scene occurs with Barthelmess and Eilers in separate rooms , divided by a wall ; then , the camera moves is a way which pleasantly violates the " Fourth Wall " rule ( showing the set ) . Another notable sequence occurs later in the film , near the end ; wherein , John Wayne appears as an extra . Mr . Wayne plays Mr . Brown's co-pilot , on a downed plane , to the left of your screen . He tries to save a drunken passenger . A somewhat unpredictable ending keeps the film above average .
452416	15896852	19558	6.0	In Apple Blossom Time	In Vienna , before The Great War ( aka World War I ) , dashing Erich von Stroheim ( as Nicki ) is a Prince with little family money ; therefore , parents George Fawcett and Maude George ( as Prince and Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg ) want their son to wed the wealthy , but crippled , Zasu Pitts ( as Cecelia ) . Mr . von Stroheim seems game ; though , obviously , he plans to continue bedding maids and other girlies . However , attending the " Corpus Christi " celebration , he meets impoverished beauty Fay Wray ( as Mitzi ) . And , for von Stroheim and Ms . Wray , it's love at first sight . As if matters weren't complicated enough for the mutually attracted pair , Wray has been promised to spitting butcher Mathew Betz ( as Schani ) . Will von Stroheim marry for love , or money ? " The Wedding March " is a very well-produced film , but Stroheim miscasts himself as the romantic young " love child " ; and , he takes more than a little getting used to . When Wray falls in love with him , Stroheim recalls , all decked out , the cruel " Iron Man " knight which helps open the film . By the end , this appears to have been intentional . The film is , also , way too lengthy ; while possessing some lovely images , it drowns itself in a sea of apple blossoms . The soft focus lens is unnecessarily excessive on Wray's beautiful , young face . The actresses perform very well ( Wray , Pitts and George ) ; and the photography , including a color segment by Ray Rennahan , is luxurious .
453338	15896852	2214	6.0	Griffith Gets Sweet on West	On an opportunistic walk in the country , Blanche Sweet encounters a snake , and is rescued by dashing Charles West ; the two are mutually attracted , and begin courting . Mr . West is Ms . Sweet's ideal . Then , trouble arrives from the city , in the form of Dorothy Bernard , Sweet's visiting sister . Introducing Ms . Bernard to a pal doesn't work ; and , she sets her sights on her sister's beau . Soon , it's West and Bernard strolling in the country ; and , Sweet is devastated ? Director D . W . Griffith employs the " classic love triangle " very well ; with Sweet , West , and Bernard playing the roles perfectly . Of course , the characters are placed in the expected danger situation , which is suspensefully staged and directed . While this may not be the most innovative Griffith , it's definitely a crosscutting cut above your average early 1900s film .

Naturally , as a famed symbologist , Mr . Hanks is called upon , to help investigate the murder . Assisting Hanks is pretty police cryptologist Audrey Tautou ( as Sophie Neveu ) . Ms . Tautou immediately hooks up with Hanks ; and , the two quickly turn from investigators to investigated . Meanwhile , fanatical self-flogging murderer Paul Bettany ( as Silas ) eludes capture ? Writer Dan Brown's storyline is a grand one ; and , director Ron Howard's film adaptation of " The DaVinci Code " is definitely well-produced . Still , it's neither as successful nor startling as the book . If you've managed to stay unfamiliar with the main plot revelations , they should be apparent by the time Ian McKellen ( as Leigh Teabing ) pontificates . Mr . McKellen and Mr . Bettany effectively play their showy supporting roles . Hans Zimmer contributes a marvelous soundtrack . Until something better comes along , this version of the story is intriguing , at least .

They have no money to pay their bill , so they invent a series of ailments for Mr . Albertson to act out in order to distract hotel management . The four hope an upcoming production of a play will reverse their fortunes . " Room Service " finds the Brothers slightly of the mark . Groucho and Chico appear uninterested , especially when watching the other performers . Harpo is more lively , but is still not quite Harpo ; his " Say Ahhhh ? " goes on too long . Oddly , enough , the fourth member of their team , Mr . Albertson , turns in the more consistent performance . Donald MacBride is also very good . Lucille Ball acts like the Marx Brothers - standing around until her next line . Ann Miller is more interested , as Albertson's squeeze . A flying turkey steals the show !

Pretty teenage sleuth Bonita Granville ( as Nancy Drew ) and the girls hope the woman's offer of $250 , 000 will be used to install a swimming pool . When the elderly woman disappears just before making the donation , Ms . Granville suspects foul play . Her father , lawyer John Litel ( as Carson Drew ) , and others try to veer Granville of the case ; but , she is determined to find the missing woman . Granville enlists help from young wavy-haired neighbor Frankie Thomas ( as Ted Nickerson ) . The " Carolyn Keene " characters were unfamiliar to this commenter , but this certainly seems like a satisfactory adaptation . Granville , who made an impression in " These Three " ( 1936 ) , is an attractive , determined , intelligent , and charming heroine . Unlike most early " teen " stars , Granville appears natural and endearing , even with expressions like " I'll bet you $23 . 80 " and " I should say not ! " Mr . Thomas , who made an impression in " Wednesday's Child " ( 1934 ) , is similarly appealing and unaffected , for a 1930s movie juvenile . Thomas says " Let's keep it clean " and makes the " drag " scene . " Nancy Drew - Detective " shows how well a " small " genre film can be done . Granville and Thomas make a cute team .

453527	15896852	56575	6.0	A Touch of Doris	Doris Day gets her outfit ruined , but meets wealthy Cary Grant . She accepts his romantic trip to Bermuda , but gets " cold feet " in the bedroom . Ms . Day's portrayal of a sexually repressed woman facing the prospect of becoming an " old maid " was very good - especially during the sequence where she imagines a series of beds while out with Mr . Grant . She is nervous about sex and / or wants husbandry at this point in her life , so she refrains . Later , she changes her mind and returns to Bermuda , but is too drunk for sex . Day , drunk and spread-eagled on bed waving a bottle of booze on her toe , is very funny ! I do not understand Grant's character ; he is seen stepping out with other women , and states he not attracted to Day ( though , he did like kissing her back ) ; all of the sudden , he seems to be in love with her ! Maybe because she said " No " ? Also , I do not understand how a psychiatrist would be unable to deal with homosexuality ( he believes Gig Young's character is gay ) . The film looks beautiful - sets and photography . The practice of blurring Ms . Day is not as bad as in other films . I don't know why it's necessary to blur Ms . Day in this film ; she would look fine with the older Grant . That Touch of Mink ( 1962 ) Delbert Mann - Cary Grant , Doris Day , Gig Young
453203	15896852	21885	6.0	A Little Theatrics Goes a Long Way	" This is theatrical ! " declares prosecutor Frank Sheridan , as the final " A Free Soul " trial is re-opened , near the end of the movie . Indeed , this is an extremely theatrical melodrama . The prosecutor's exclamation comes as alcoholic defense lawyer Lionel Barrymore quizzes actressy daughter Norma Shearer about her affair with underworld gambler Clark Gable . Yes , theatrical . Ms . Shearer is too often using her hands to exclaim ; however , she is a riveting , and sexy " Jan Ashe " . Mr . Barrymore ( as Stephen Ashe ) is incredibly coherent , for a drunken defender , as he teeters over the edge . Gable ( as Ace Wilfong ) displays an abundance of the aggressive manliness audiences loved in the 1930s . So , you get three great stars doing what they do best . Slightly over the top , but fun to watch ; supporting players Leslie Howard , James Gleason , and Lucy Beaumont are almost as much , in less flashy roles . For its time , the characterizations and subject matter were commendable . The ace film-making team of Clarence Brown ( director ) and William Daniels ( camera ) make " A Free Soul " look lovely . Interestingly , the Willard Mack play " A Free Soul " ( 1928 ) starred Kay Johnson ( star of the just released " Madam Satan " ) , and featured the great , pre-celluloid Melvyn Douglas ( as Ace ) .
452503	15896852	70533	6.0	Dan Curtis Produces Dorian Gray	The story is familiar - Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray wishes his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . This is the version from Dan Curtis Productions , which produced the TV-series " Dark Shadows " from 1966-1971 ; the television show incorporated a version of " Dorian Gray " into the series ' " 1897 flashback " ( 1969 ) . The next film , the sexually charged " Dorian Gray " ( 1970 ) , starred Helmut Berger . But , the most well-known version remains " The Picture of Dorian Gray " ( 1945 ) , which starred Hurd Hatfield . This " The Picture of Dorian Gray " ( 1973 ) was produced for late night TV , and the " videotape " quality shows , sadly . Still , it plays . Few actors could play the part as deliciously as Helmut Berger ( who fitted the part like a glove ) ; but , Shane Briant takes a fine turn in the lead role . Mr . Briant's Dorian is sweeter-looking , but much more evil . Nigel Davenport , John Karlen , and Fionnula Flanagan head a great group of supporting players . The 1973 TV film , oddly enough , portrays Dorian as more wicked than other versions . For example , Briant's character has sex with a child ; and , it's not ambiguous ! In addition to upping the wickedness , the film is played more for horror than drama .

452869	15896852	361462	6.0	All in Color for a Dime	High School history teacher , and unapologetic fanboy , Mark Hamill ( as Don Swan ) is tapped to serve as technical adviser for a film adapting the adventures of his favorite super-hero , " Commander Courage " . The film producers decide it would financially rewarding for a documentary to accompany the film , and DVD . So , Hamill is followed around , showing his love for " Commander Courage " ( and bare-legged sidekick " Liberty Lad " ) , interviewing comic strip celebrities ( like the Marvelous Stan Lee ) , and inadvertently causing trouble for the movie studio . Don't search your " Golden Age " comic book collection for any evidence of " Commander Courage " . The " Wow Comics " heroes " Mr . Scarlett ( & Pinky ) " and " Commando Yank " look promising , but the super-hero is more ( or less ) a composite creation . His origin is like a " Big Bang " version of Fawcett's " Captain Marvel " . As with " real " comic heroes , " Commander Courage ( and Liberty Lad " ) " undergo a steroids ' n ' silicone reboot . The " Dark Age " version is the movie studio's interest , much to Hamill's chagrin . Mr . Hamill's film satirically illustrates what it attempts ; but , its specialized focus does not , unfortunately , advance the idea that comic books are an important art form . Instead , the film will probably confirm an unbeliever's view of comic book aficionados as arrestedly developed . " Comic Book : The Movie " is funnier as a satire on Hollywood studio types . While obviously low budget , it is an enjoyable movie . Cameraman Jess Harnell ( as Ricky ) is the film's greatest asset . Mr . Harnell smoothly makes every one of his lines , both scripted and improvised , work . Harnell is Hamill's indispensable , and sometimes hilarious , sidekick ( and , he does a fantastic Beatles impression ) . Billy West ( as Leo Matuzik ) has some Keatonesque deadpan moments . Discovered in " a musical version of ' Under the Yum Yum Tree ' " , Daran Norris ( as Bruce Easily ) essays one of the better " comic " characterizations . And , Jonathan Winters and Maggie Thompson show how to give a great " cameo " performance . Do NOT skip viewing the full version of Hamill's historically revelatory interview with Hugh Hefner , on disc two . Finally , Matt Kenny , the boy receiving a " Shazam ! " toy from Hamill , is the film's biggest super-hero . He REALLY knowing his " Marvel Family " characters . Comic Book : The Movie ( 2004 ) Mark Hamill - Mark Hamill , Jess Harnell , Billy West
452435	15896852	17492	6.0	Limehouse Hoer	In the seedy Limehouse district of London , Colleen Moore ( as Twinkletoes ) rushes to bust up a major street brawl , with her comedic ballet routine . Ms . Moore's charming dance , with musical assist from father Tully Marshall ( as Dad Minasi ) , soothes the savagery . Ironically , Moore falls in love with the man in the center of the conflict , professional boxer Kenneth Harlan ( as Chuck Lightfoot ) . Mr . Harlan is also enchanted with Moore ; however , he is already married to boozy , shrewish Gladys Brockwell ( as Cissie ) . This film was released in late 1926 , around the time Colleen Moore was determined to be the year's # 1 US Box Office Star , by Quigley Publications ( currently recognized as the industry standard ) . So , Moore is justified in production and characterization resembling Lillian Gish or Mary Pickford ; she had reached a equalizing level . " Twinkletoes " is an enjoyable feature , although it falls short of the poetic standard it is so obviously straining to achieve .
452521	15896852	26123	6.0	Binary Boris Karloff	Boris Karloff ( as Gregor and Anton de Bergmann ) plays cursed twins , separated as young children . " Twenty years later " ( forty would have been closer to the lead actor's apparent age ) , good twin " Anton " returns to the old Hungarian homestead , where bad twin " Gregor " presides as Baron . They , and most everyone in town , are aware of a " Cain and Abel " - recalling curse , which dictates that the younger Karloff kill the older Karloff , in " The Black Room " . Can two Karloffs survive in the castle , and for how long ? The dualistic Karloff , director Roy William Neill , and photographer Allen Siegler make an otherwise very ordinary , predictable film look much better than it should . Karloff's performance in the later half is especially outstanding ; he makes it very difficult to turn away from the screen . Lightly porcelain-faced blonde Marian Marsh ( as Thea Hassle ) is a beautiful vis-à-vis . The Black Room ( 1935 ) Roy William Nell - Boris Karloff , Marian Marsh , Robert Allen
453360	15896852	24008	6.0	The Huntress Gets Captured by The Game	Ruth Chatterton ( as Alison Drake ) is the successful president of " Drake Motors " ; she runs a tight ship , and has a yen for good-looking men . In fact , she enjoys treating men they way they have always treated women ; and , attractive new hires are invited to Ms . Chatterton's mansion for an evening of vodka and sex . When invitees get out of line , or expect more than a " one night stand " , Chatterton has them transferred . The boss woman goes unsatisfied when evening " pick up " George Brent ( as Jim Thorne ) turns her down . When she discovers Mr . Brent is a new hire at her company , Chatterton again tries , and fails , to seduce him . Has Chatterton finally met her match ? " Female " looks most like a William A . Wellman film , but boasts three directors ; and , here's how ( more or less ) : The film's director was William Dieterle ; then , he became ill . So , the film was directed ( mostly ) by Mr . Wellman . However , Jack Warner was unhappy with George Blackwood's performance ( as Cooper ) . The studio ordered the scenes with Mr . Blackwood re-shot . Then , Michael Curtiz directed ( only ) the scenes with Blackwood's replacement , Johnny Mack Brown ( as Cooper ) . Still , the completed film was to credit Wellman ( rightly ) . But , Wellman and Warner Brothers terminated their relationship ( unhappily ) . So , the studio credited Mr . Curtiz . With whomever directing , Chatterton is terrific ; sadly , her efforts are ruined by an ending which is almost repulsive - - what this film does to Chatterton's character is criminal . Still , " Female " is well worth watching , mainly for Chatterton's great style , and performance . Brent ( her off-screen husband , at the time ) is at his very best , too . And , the supporting cast is great fun . For example , Ferdinand Gottschalk ( as Pettigrew ) amuses in the workplace ; and , don't miss Rafaela Ottiano ( as Della ) getting a swat in the derrière ! Note Ms . Ottiano was Greta Garbo's maid in " Grand Hotel " ( 1932 ) ; incidentally , Garbo used the name " Harriet Brown " ( Lois Wilson's character ) , and the soon divorced leading man George Brent , from this film . Small world .

His steadfast pal , William Bakewell ( as Tex McNeil ) , can't defend Mr . Haines without ending up in the hospital ; and girlfriend Joan Crawford ( as Betty Channing ) grows more distant as Haines juvenile behavior becomes more and more tiresome . What will it take for Mr . Haines to win Ms . Crawford's heart ? Will Mr . Bakewell regain his health ? Can Haines straighten up in time to help his teammates win the big game ? " West Point " is a typical Haines film vehicle ; it is worth checking out to see the popular actor's performance , and enjoyable screen presence . It is neither his most satisfying characterization , nor his best film ; but , Haines is still great . Crawford's emoting is less polished , in an early role . Surprisingly , Bakewell offers the film's strongest performance ( highlighted by his hospital bed scene ) . Edward Sedgwick's direction makes the most of Haines ' silliness , and David Davidson's soundtrack is wonderful ( albeit sounding too seasonal , at times ) .
453293	15896852	33190	6.0	Turnabout is a Good Play	Although Adolphe Menjou is billed first , the " Turnabout " stars are John Hubbard ( as Tim , then Sally ) and Carole Landis ( as Sally , then Tim ) ; they play a bickering couple who are granted a wish : they switch bodies ! There are some stereotypes evident , but this is a surprisingly well-done comedy from the time period . Possibly , the most " offensive " bit is not the gender role playing , but the repeated bit involving Mr . Menjou and the water fountain . Donald Meek ( as Henry ) and Marjorie Main ( as Nora ) are delightful as servants to the gender-bending couple . Mr . Hubbard and Ms . Landis are funny and believable . The ending is a trifle weak ; but , " Turnabout " is an enjoyable surprise . Turnabout ( 1940 ) Hal Roach - John Hubbard , Carole Landis , Adolphe Menjou

After losing several Germans to Law's bullets , the Nazis send their own Major sharpshooter , Ed Harris ( as König ) , out to bag Law . Meanwhile , Law and Fiennes form the obligatory " love triangle " with fetching Rachel Weisz ( as Tania ) . Jean-Jacques Annaud directs big production values well enough , and the story's setting is a refreshing change from the usual western-fronted World War II epics . But , the whole thing collapses under its unnecessary , and startlingly ordinary " love triangle " . Law and Ms . Weisz are the main lovey-dovey duo . Their love-making scene may remind you about . . . well , not waking up the roommate . Duplicitous chocolate-loving young Gabriel Thomson ( as Sasha ) and Mr .

452620	15896852	352248	6.0	A Working Class Hero Is Something to Be	" In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J . Braddock " is how the famed writer ( and boxing fan ) Damon Runyon described the Boxer he dubbed " Cinderella Man " . Director Ron Howard uses the quote to open the film . So , you are guaranteed a heartwarming story of a man who overcomes abject poverty . Russell Crowe ( as Jim Braddock ) begins as a moderately successful boxer , living with wife Renée Zellweger ( as Mae ) and their three young children . The Braddock family suffers through bad luck , cold New Jersey winters , and the Great Depression . If you've been cold and poor , you'll identify with warming socks in the stove and adding water to stretch a bottle of milk . The film's , and the leading character's , high moral tone is set when Mr . Crowe , in an early scene , brings his son to the local butcher shop ; there , the boy returns a piece of meat he stole to feed the hungry Braddock family . " No matter what happens , we don't steal , " Crowe explains . Ever . He also promises the children , " We will never send you away , " and sobs when poverty dictates otherwise . His dedication and commitment to his wife and children are the driving force in the life of the boxer . Today , the boxing ring has been taken over , in popularity , by choreographed pretenders . But , once upon a time , you were to cause your opponent actual physical damage . Continuing to hit someone in the head until they fell , " Knocked Out " , was the prime directive . During a fight , Crowe's manager Paul Giamatti ( as Joe Gould ) demands , " Fill his face with blood ! " Later , Crowe's Braddock is successful enough to face wicked champion Craig Bierko ( as Max Baer ) , who is credited as having " killed two men in the ring . " So , the fight is promoted as a chance to witness a potential murder . Boxing and morality make strange bedfellows . But , " Cinderella Man " is a pretty , predictable , and well-produced film .

453019	15896852	50468	6.0	The OK Corral Legend Grows Longer	For Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas , Dennis Hopper , and / or western fans , generally , this movie is O . K . Others may want to make a full pot of coffee before viewing " Gunfight at the O . K . Corral " . Could they stretch out the story of these characters any further ? Anyway , it has some differences from other versions . Mr . Lancaster and Mr . Douglas are both good , and the film is mostly enjoyable if you like the epic western style represented ; although , in my opinion , this isn't really the best version of the story . The singing of Frankie Laine was okay , but I confess to wondering , each time he sang , can this be near the end ? . I found myself bored , and read signs ; for example , the " Eddie Foy " sign - that was a favorite . The signs that , finally say , " O . K . " and " O . K . Corral " were signs of relief ! Just like they said , the movie is O . K . Gunfight at the O . K . Corral ( 1957 ) John Sturges - Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas , Dennis Hopper

Soon , he starts to uncover the truth behind his brother's death and unravel the unbelievable turns his life has taken ? " Actually ( or perhaps not ? ) , Mr . Phillippe falls in love with his estranged brother's fiancée ( Ms . Polley ) , which results in a violent confrontation - and , an even more tragic car accident , involving all three . Roland Suso Richter's direction of Michael Cooney's " Point of Death " is intriguing , engrossing , and imaginatively plotted . But , the ending does not really fulfill the film's promises - and , the lead character's relationships with both brother and lover lack passion . Still , it's more good than not .

These operatives for hire , known as " Ronin " , are assembled in France by a mysterious client for an extremely dangerous mission : steal a top-secret briefcase . This seemingly easy task soon proves explosive as other underworld organizations vie for the same prize . But to get the job done , this rag-tag group of misfits , led by an ex-CIA agent named Sam ( De Niro ) , must do something they've never done before - trust each other ! " Head " Ronin " ( think Japanese samurai ) Robert De Niro ( as Sam ) and Jean Reno ( as Vincent ) are definitely a team you want on your side ; the two actors have a cool chemistry , which almost makes up for the lack of an intellectually stimulating story . It can also be fun to guess where the team's traitors lurk - sometimes obvious , and sometimes not . Director John Frankenheimer and photographer Robert Fraisse provide you with wild , speeding car chases - which more than deliver orgasmic crashes . Hopefully , the citizens of Paris were advised to stay in their homes during filming . If filmmakers wanted to leave you with some mystery about the contents of a certain silver suitcase , they certainly succeeded . Probably , it was only a pair of silver ice skates .

453598	15896852	30384	6.0	Orphans in the Dorm	Freddie Bartholomew stars as a seemingly upper crust " Lord " ( Jeff Braemer ) who is really an orphaned thief ; suspected in an emerald necklace heist , he is sent to a navel academy and meets idealized Irish orphan Mickey Rooney ( as Terry O'Mulvaney ) . Boy-among-the-young-men Terry Kilburn ( as Albert Baker ) keeps the " cute quotient " high . Their roles are tailor-made for Mr . Bartholomew's " British upper crust " and Mr . Rooney's " Irish working lad " personas . Bartholomew is perfect as the aristocratically-guised London thief , complaining about the " wretched " hotel service and fainting during opportune moments . Bussed to a a purgatory-type sailor school ( not quite a hellish reform school ) , he immediately clashes with Rooney . The two " child stars " contrast well , and their difficult bonding becomes the film's main source of entertainment . Rooney is much more relaxed in " Lord Jeff " than other " orphaned lad " roles ; here , he exudes natural likability . Kilburn's little Albert seems out of place among the older boys , but he performs as well , and gives Bartholomew's character some much-needed appeal . Other story structure , and editing , problems weaken the running time . Irrelevant , probably , to the film " Lord Jeff " is the status of its two stars . Bartholomew was a very popular " boy star " and Rooney was much more popular as a " teen star " ; and , they made several films together . This film catches the Bartholomew near the end of his career , and Rooney beginning his most successful years . With this in mind , don't miss their mid-film fistfight !

453304	15896852	41555	6.0	Knocking Down the House	Accused of killing a policeman , ageing juvenile delinquent John Derek ( as Nick " Pretty Boy " Romano ) turns to lawyerly father figure Humphrey Bogart ( as Andrew Morton ) for defense . Mr . Bogart was acquainted with Mr . Derek's similarly jailed father , and had been trying to rehabilitate the young man , off and on , over the years . Derek swears he is innocent ; and , believing him , Bogart takes the case . District Attorney George Macready ( as Kerman ) is just as sure that Derek is guilty . When the trial begins , Bogart tells the unfortunate story of Derek's life , which is shown in flashbacks ? Derek's life is , indeed , filled with misfortune . After the death of his father , young Derek is reared in slums ; caught stealing , he is sent to reform school . Upon release , Derek fails to " go straight " , despite getting a legitimate job , and marrying the attractive , compassionate young Allene Roberts ( as Emma ) . During the flashback sequences , the film's weakness is exposed - - while there is nothing wrong with his performance , Derek isn't given enough script to thoroughly make the film's point : that young men like him are " angels with dirty faces . " This theme , that society was the cause of juvenile delinquency , had been a subtle part of movies during the 1930s-'40s . " Knock on Any Door " makes the theme explicit ; but , the film does not offer strong enough characterizations to back up its thesis . Willard Motley's original novel was much clearer , undoubtedly ; an accurate film adaptation was unlikely in 1949 . Mr . Motley's sequel " Let No Man Write My Epitaph " , was adapted for film , more successfully , in 1960 . Together , the Motley novels might make an interesting " epic " re-make . Still , Nichols Ray and Bogart make " Knock on Any Door " interesting viewing . The supporting cast is full of faces to spot : Dooley Wilson , Sid Melton , John Mitchum , and others .
453592	15896852	19824	6.0	That Griffith Woman	Briefly , as explained in an introductory title card , " This is the historic tale of two people whose lives are an immortal romance ; the story of the love and destiny of England's greatest beauty , and England's greatest sailor . " The film focuses on the greatest beauty of Corinne Griffith ( as Emma Hart ) . Her main lover is the greatest sailor , Victor Varconi ( as Horatio Nelson ) . Ms . Griffith dominates the drama , which begins in late 18th century England . Introduced as a servant girl , Griffith becomes enamored with noble boss Ian Keith ( as Charles Greville ) . After gaining a reputation as a " vulgar hussy " , Griffith is sent to Italy ; there , she becomes more ladylike , and marries Mr . Keith's uncle , H . B . Warner ( as William Hamilton ) . Then , as " Lady Hamilton " , she meets , and has an historically influential affair with Mr . Varconi , her " true love " . " The Divine Lady " is a showy , costly production . It was noticed during the second " Academy Awards " ceremony for the direction of Frank Lloyd . Mr . Lloyd's direction is , indeed , a strength ; in one scene , he makes you feel you are on a Ferris Wheel . Lloyd was also noted for directing Richard Barthelmess in " Weary River " and " Drag " , films which sandwiched " Divine Lady " . John Seitz ' photography is another strength ; he is responsible for many beautiful scenes ; and , of course , shows superstar Griffith in her best light . Comic relief Marie Dressler ( as Mrs . Hart ) appears too briefly . In 1994 , Corinne Griffith received a belated " Academy Award " nomination as " Best Actress " for " The Divine Lady " ; the revelation appeared in Robert Osborne's " 65 Years of the Oscar : The Official History of the Academy Awards " . There were no actual " nominations " announced that year ( actually , the 1928-29 season ) ; after the awards gained stature , there were attempts to bring the earlier ceremonies in line with what was becoming the industry standard . The inclusion of Griffith's name among the nominees may have been due to a suggestion Jeanne Eagels ' performance in " The Letter " be dropped , since she died in October 1929 . A look at the other nominations would support Griffith's inclusion ; however , the second ceremony was not one of the Academy's best efforts . Griffith's starry , self-conscious performance was better than " Best Actress " winner Mary Pickford's , in " Coquette " ; but , so were most . Lillian Gish and Greta Garbo essayed far superior characterizations , during the eligibility period , but were not nominated . However , dog star Rin Tin Tin was considered for a " Best Actor " nomination . The Divine Lady ( / 29 ) Frank Lloyd - Corinne Griffith , Victor Varconi , H . B . Warner
453480	15896852	134619	6.0	A Clockwork Apple Pie	Muscular , handsome James Marsden ( as Steve Clark ) moves to the sleepy island town of " Cradle Bay " , with his parents and younger sister , after older brother " Alan " shoots himself to death . The family enrolls the children in " Cradle Bay High School " . Predictably , the high school is full of obviously older actors cast as teenagers . Oddly , Mr . Marsden finds it difficult to fit in with his peers , especially a group of do-gooders called the " Blue Ribbons " , who swear off sex , drugs , and rock and roll music . Instead , " Blue Ribbons " save their juices , eat yogurt , and listen to Wayne Newton and Barry Manilow music . Marsden does connect with grungy stoner Nick Stahl ( as Gavin Strick ) . Mr . Stahl thinks some form of mind-control is infecting the town . Stahl has witnessed some mysterious behavior ( the film's opening shocker ) ; he tells Marsden ; but , Marsden thinks Stahl's just a tweaked , paranoid druggie . Through Stahl , Marsden meets hot , slim-waisted Rachel Wagner ( who moved from " Dawson's Creek " to " Cradle Bay " ) . Ms . Wagner and Marsden form the obligatory romantic twosome ; they pose , and perform , well together . However , the superior role , and performance , is Stahl's " Gavin " ; he is the most normal acting of the lot , on or off drugs . Filming in Canada , David Nutter and John Bartley make " Disturbing Behavior " look way better than expected ; there are quite a few nice location scenes . And , you have to like the high school janitor , with Kurt Vonnegut's " Slaughterhouse-Five " in his hip pocket . It would have been nice to see more of that part of the story ; perhaps , with Stahl and William Sadler setting up a resistance and / or investigation center in the high school basement . And , more close-ups of Steve Railsback's " Officer Cox " . The film too suddenly becomes " A Clockwork Orange " , then " Terminator " ; and , the ending just makes you wish Stahl had more participation .

They are : computer expert Robert Redford ( as Bishop ) , former CIA employee Sidney Poitier ( as Crease ) , gadgets wizard Dan Ackroyd ( as Mother ) , young genius River Phoenix ( as Carl ) , and blind soundman David Strathairn ( as Whistler ) . The men are joined in progress by Mary McDonnell ( as Liz ) , likely a former " Sneaker " and definitely a former girlfriend of leader Redford . Mr . Redford , who dominates the action , is also connected to the film's main villain , Ben Kingsley ( as Cosmo ) . Mr . Kingsley's identity isn't too surprising , once you realize he didn't grow up to be the character played by Mr . Ackroyd . The mission is to retrieve a " black box " for some nasty men , who claim to be representing the United States government . The best chunk of the film involves the extended " computer date " Ms . McDonnell has with Stephen Tobolowsky ( as Werner Brandes ) as Redford breaks into the man's office . It begins about the time Mr . Ackroyd arrives with the man's trash and ends with Mr . Phoenix crashing into a scene between Redford and nasty Eddie Jones . Director Phil Alden Robinson , and WarGames-men Lawrence Lasker and Walter F . Parkes , create a good deal of suspense , highlighted by a light sense of humor . But , the picture's conflict ( Redford / Kingsley ) isn't very interesting or dramatic . Although the terrific " Sneakers " team falls short of expectations , their participation alone makes it a film worth watching .

Arthur , the great king of Camelot , had devoted his life to building a land of peace an justice . Now he wished to marry . But the peace was not to last . The most powerful of Arthur's knights , Prince Malagant , had long been jealous of the King's glory . Now he found cause to quarrel with Arthur and left Camelot with hearted in his heart . And so the land was divided again , between those who rallied to Prince Malagant , seeking the spoils of war , and those who stayed loyal to the King . And then there was Lancelot , a wanderer who had never dreamed of peace or justice or knighthood . Times were hard . A man made his living any way he could . And Lancelot had always been good with a sword ? " An awareness of a general negativity concerning this film is one of the reasons it's a more enjoyable than not . Even without lowered expectations , " First Knight " is an above average film . Jerry Zucker directs a series of well-paced action scenes with pomp and circumstance . William Nicholson's screenplay focuses on the " love triangle " formed with Richard Gere ( as Sir Lancelot ) falling in love with Julia Ormond ( as Lady Guinevere ) on her way to marry Sean Connery ( as King Arthur ) . It isn't difficult to figure out the rest of the story . The three principal players are nicely suited to their roles . Mr . Gere plays " Lancelot " ( the leading man ) with nobility and nonchalance ; he has a gracefulness which might have been utilized in other Errol Flynn-type roles , had he chosen to perform them . Ms . Ormond adds a considerable amount of spirited resoluteness to her " Guinevere " ; this , combined with her physical beauty , makes her irresistible . Mr . Connery's " King Arthur " gives the film an old-world foundation . Ben Cross ( as Prince Malagant ) heads up a splendid supporting cast , with something old John Gielgud ( as Oswald ) , and something new Stuart Bunce ( as Peter ) , all dressed up in something blue . So , where's the rub ? The valiant filmmakers took a chance by removing the mythological elements . The wizard " Merlin " does not appear . " Excalibur " has no magical powers . Stripped of its magic , the still noble " Camelot " is a nice place to visit , but you wouldn't want to live there . First Knight ( / 95 ) Jerry Zucker - Richard Gere , Julia Ormond , Sean Connery

Writer / director Matthew Bright's version of the Grimm classic " Little Red Riding Hood " could be described as a crude satire . Sometimes , it is very amusing ; especially funny are Witherspoon's reactions to Sutherland . Witherspoon holds the film's interest . There are a dozen entertaining supporting roles . Susan Barnes is a highly pleasing prison matron . And , dysfunctional parents Amanda Plummer ( as Ramona ) and Michael T . Weiss ( as Larry ) get things off to a great start . Mr .

Villainous Cyril Chadwick ( as Peter Jesson ) comes between them . Will Mr . O'Brien and Ms . Bellamy come together ? Will the Central Pacific railroad and the Union Pacific railroad hook up ? Only time will tell ? This film takes a long , long time to pick up steam . Star O'Brien ( and many regular cast members ) appear only after a prolonged prologue . Some of the supporting cast are dispensable , like the unfunny " three musketeers " . Fortunately , " The Iron Horse " is expertly directed by John Ford ; and , lead actor O'Brien is very appealing .

He also won a wife , Ann Little ( as Dorothy ) . Ms . Little has convinced Mr . Reid to give up dangerous car-racing ; now , he is the manager of her father , Theodore Roberts ( as J . D . " The Bear " Ward ) ' s , company . Reid has settled into domestic tranquility , but will a threat to his old record ( and sick kid ) tempt him into revisiting the dangerous game of auto racing ? Hint : the film is titled " Excuse My Dust ! " As a sequel , speed writer Byron Morgan's story is more contrived and unimaginative than his other " speed flicks " . The cars are better displayed than earlier , however ; and , Tully Marshall ( as Mutchler ) is a welcome addition to the returning cast . One scene , where Reid nearly kills his son , is rather more uncomfortable than exciting ; some audiences may have thought Wally , Dorothy , and Junior were the real Reid family .

The couple seem to be getting over the possible loss of a daughter ( " Karen " ) , and begin to treat Mr . Wilson as a member of their cold , distant family . He's a good fit . Mr . Cox offers fatherly help in getting Wilson a job at the post office ; there , he meets Janeane Garofalo ( as Ferrin ) . Ms . Garofalo is attracted to Wilson , but he appears disinterested . Hampton Fancher's " The Minus Man " is baffling . What's up with the imaginary room entrance , the borrowed truck , and the head bashing ? What compels Wilson ? Was it the spider that crawled in his ear ? Are the detectives imaginary , or from the future ? Like Vann says , " There's a mystery here that I could one day be tempted to explore , when I learn it better . " The film is interesting and well-performed , but only minimally satisfying as a story . The Minus Man ( 1999 ) Hampton Fancher - Owen Wilson , Janeane Garofalo , Brian Cox
452466	15896852	623147	6.0	Jodie Foster Raises Caine	Entranced by her mandolin playing , Caine accompanies little Jodie Foster ( as Alethea Patricia Ingram ) to a waiting stagecoach . When the coach arrives , an unwelcome gunfight results in Ms . Foster mistakenly believing she sees Caine shoot an innocent man to death . Foster's testimony results in Caine being convicted as a murderer . Although she likes Caine ( she cannot understand why he did it ) , Foster is compelled to tell the truth . And , Caine supports her honesty . Will it result in Caine's death by hanging ? Carradine and Foster are excellent ; they make the somewhat uncertain story believable . Perhaps the oddest moment is when Carradine seems to sigh regretfully when a " lie " saves his life . The episode challenges perceptions about truth . At least , it ends well ; how could it not ? Of the fine " Kung Fu " supporting cast , Radames Pera ( as the younger Caine ) is featured well . With Foster and Pera highlighted , grasshoppers rule the day .

453299	15896852	39190	6.0	A Misguided Bishop for Christmas	First , this film would be more accurately titled " The Bishop " because it's more about David Niven's character than his wife . Mr . Niven plays the Bishop ; and , he is married to Loretta Young ; they are Episcopalian . Niven wants money for a huge Cathedral ; so , an Angel in the form of Cary Grant goes down to grant his wish - or , does he ? You'll want to watch if you like the stars . Ms . Young is perhaps the best ; she plays the wife with the right level of innocence , and creates a solid character . Niven does well in a difficult part , discovering something about wishing , and what to wish for . . . Cary Grant always lifts a film , but his portrayal of the Angel is the film's weak link . There are several times when you think Mr . Grant is going to kiss the wedded Young ! Grant is lighted differently , to make him look Angelic . If you're wondering , " What is this film trying to be ? " by the end , you'll know . . . Of course , there is a " heart-warming " Christmas message .

452461	15896852	32428	6.0	Angels in Disguise ( with Scratches )	The first " East Side Kids " feature reaches back to the original " Dead End " formula , as another movie studio decides to cash in on the kids . " Monogram " couldn't obtain any of the six original young scene stealers , so they built their team around second stringers . The leader role , usually assigned to Billy Halop , went to Harris Berger ( as Danny Dolan ) . Mr . Berger had joined the original stage play , and was already appearing in Universal's " Dead End " features . The Bobby Jordan-type role is played by Hal E . " Hally " Chester ( as Fred " Dutch " Kuhn ) , who was featured most prominently ( of this cast ) in previous " Dead End " films . Leo Gorcey and the others are replaced by : Frankie Burke ( as Skinny ) , Donald Haines ( as PeeWee ) , Edwin " Eddie " Brian ( as Mike ) , and Sam Edwards ( as Pete ) . And , for one film only , Jack Edwards ( as Algernon " The Mouse " Wilkes ) joins the group , playing the well-heeled " sissy " who wants to be " tough " . The " Dead End " plot variation involves grown-up juvenile delinquent Leon Ames ( as Pat O'Day ) trying to help out some young " Angels with Dirty Faces " . Now a policeman , Mr . Ames decides to open a club for " Danny's Gang " , to keep them out of trouble . Ames recalls his youth as a young gangster , with Dennis Moore ( as " Mile-Away " Harris ) and Dave O'Brien ( as " Knuckles " Dolan ) . Although they are still friendly , Mr . Moore is on the wrong side of the law . Mr . O'Brien , Danny's big brother , is falsely imprisoned . The film is rushed and rough - which , on one level , helps . With re-takes , Mr . Burke's background " scratch and sniff " scene would be " corrected " , but it fits the " Dead End " kid atmosphere perfectly . The film , with some additional work , would be on par with the " Warner Brothers " features . The real Bobby Jordan took over the role of " Danny Dolan " for this film's sequel , " Boys of the City " ; and , early in this " Monogram " series , some continuity between films in attempted .

452379	15896852	58981	6.0	Paris When It Sizzles	" All you need is a timetable , " explains playboy Tony Curtis ( as Bernard Lawrence ) , an American reporter working in Paris . Mr . Curtis keeps three blondes in one apartment , each thinking she is Curtis ' " one-and-only " fiancée . The rotating women are all airline stewardesses , on different timetables . Curtis ' sexy arrangement is discovered by envious old pal Jerry Lewis ( as Robert Reed ) . Mr . Lewis plots to take over the satisfying arrangement of women , after he learns Curtis may be transferred to New York . But , both men are threatened when the stewardesses ' flight patterns change ; and , everyone heads for the apartment bed ! Funnier than its reputation ; perhaps , the film's celebration of pseudo-promiscuity distanced it from other sixties sex comedies - - the " romance " between Lewis and Suzanna Leigh ( as Vicky " British United " Hawkins ) comes closest to " acceptable " for the genre . The other two women , hefty knockwurst-loving Christiane Schmidtmer ( as Lise " Lufthansa " Bruner ) and wispy soufflé-loving Dany Saval ( as Jacqueline " Air France " Grieux ) , are more funny than romantic . Curtis is finely frantic ; however , Lewis , in a lower key , and Thelma Ritter ( as Bertha ) are more outstanding . Boeing Boeing ( 1965 ) John Rich - Tony Curtis , Jerry Lewis , Thelma Ritter
453473	15896852	12940	6.0	J . B . Warner Jumps the Fence	Devil-may-care buckaroo J . B . Warner ( as Jim Gregory ) is torn between two pretty women : south-of-the-border Senorita Elinor Fair ( as Mercedes Aloyez ) catches his romantic eye - but , beautiful Caucasian waitress-in-distress Wilamae Carson ( as Mary Moore ) also captures his attention . Probably , the weakest part of the story involves how the women become a dilemma for Mr . Warner , because he is scripted to favor Ms . Fair almost exclusively ; Ms . Moore unexpectedly attains an equal romantic status , later in the running . And , Warner's selection seems strangely xenophobic . Despite its shortcomings , " Big Stakes " is an enjoyable , well-paced silent western . The handcuffed " big stake " opening leads a few clever bits , and the cast performs them very well . The climax provides some old-fashioned D . W . Griffith-styled excitement . Tall-in-the-saddle Warner is comically supported by rotund ton-of-fun Hilliard Karr ( as " Skinny " Fargo ) . This film provides a rare look at Warner , a western star who died unexpectedly . Les Bates and Robert Grey , the actors playing the two main villains , also died too soon .

452473	15896852	12938	6.0	Silence Is Golden	Fetching young Gloria Swanson ( as Theodora Fitzgerald ) is rescued from drowning by debonair playboy Rudolph Valentino ( as Hector Bracondale ) . Although Ms . Swanson clearly falls for Mr . Valentino , her family notes : he's not the marrying kind . They set beautiful Swanson up with elderly millionaire Robert Bolder ( as Josiah Brown ) , which enhances family fortunes considerably . On her honeymoon , Swanson slips on the Swiss Alps ; she is saved by Valentino , and the two find it difficult to resist each other ? Director Sam Wood's " Beyond the Rocks " is an enjoyable pairing of superstars Swanson and Valentino . Their initial flirtation , and fantastical costumed interludes are effective . Otherwise , the two seem more like pals than romantic partners ; and , the story is sheer nonsense . Still , this is a film found in 2003 , which co-starred not one - - but TWO of the most popular film performers of the 1920s . What will they uncover next ? Much thanks to Nederlands Filmmuseum and Milestone Films for " Beyond the Rocks " .
453556	15896852	2381	6.0	Griffith Makes Crime Pay	Early crime film directed by D . W . Griffith . Hyped in the subtitle as " Unparallel drama inspired and played on the streets of the American city - Bold - Truthful " ! Lillian Gish lives with her musician husband Walter Miller near Pig Alley , an area frequented by gangsters . The head Musketeer is Elmer Booth . Gangster Booth tries to put the make on Ms . Gish , and mugs Mr . Miller as he returns home with his hard-earned pay . Stumbling into a gang shootout , Miller recognizes Musketeer Booth as his mugger . What will he do ? Here , in " The Musketeers of Pig Alley " , Gish and Miller are better than when they are threatened by the temptress in " The Mothering Heart " ( 1913 ) . Acting more naturally , you really sympathize with the couple . Booth is an endearing " Little Caesar " . The shootout is lively , and the thugs creeping along the alley walls into close-ups is interesting . The ending is played more for humor ; it's not bad , but it breaks the mood of the movie .

452860	15896852	34936	6.0	Citizen Forrest	Keeper of the Flame ( 1942 ) George Cukor - Spencer Tracy , Katharine Hepburn , Margaret Wycherly The film opens with the never appearing " Robert Forrest " dying in a car crash . Robert Forrest was , as it turn out , a great American hero ; his tragic accident is big news ; and , and the country mourns . Biographical journalist Spencer Tracy ( as Steve O'Malley ) decides to write a story about Forrest's life ; but , the prospective " Keeper of the Flame " finds it difficult to interview beautiful Forrest widow Katharine Hepburn ( as Christine ) . And , the people closest to the deceased accident victim are mysteriously uncooperative . What are they hiding ? Tracy and Hepburn , under George Cukor's moody direction , are great fun to watch . Mr . Cukor and photographer William Daniels are especially Garbo-like when introducing Hepburn's character . Still , it's Tracy who holds everything together . The revelation about " Robert Forrest " was unexpected ( to me , anyway ) ; it was nice to see a film show the American belief system is based on ideas and truths rather than mindless patriotism . The film should have been better . First , the movie's main " romantic " relationship seems to occur too suddenly ; certainly , the film's stars were capable of portraying a man and woman falling in love . Also , what did the Forrests ' do ? It's hinted , once , that " Christine " may have been an actress ( believable ) ; but , what office did her husband hold ( if any ) ? Of the supporting cast , Margaret Wycherly seems truest , as the dead hero's " invalid " mother ; a couple of the other players become more grating than effective , after a good first impression .
453070	15896852	34928	6.0	There Were Snakes in the Jungle	Sabu ( as Mowgli ) is raised by wolves after his father is killed in the jungles of India . After a dozen or so years as an " animal " , he encounters a village of humans . The village includes his natural mother Rosemary DeCamp ( as Messua ) , who coincidently takes him in , and teaches him to speak English . But , adjusting to human life is difficult . Sabu discovers humans are a mixed bag ? Beautiful color photography is the highlight of " Jungle Book " . Additionally , the performance of Sabu is certainly intense ; his eyes , in introductory scenes , really seem like the eyes of someone raised by wolves ! Storyteller Joseph Calleia ( as Buldeo ) is charming . This is , however , a very lethargic movie . I expected to like the " village " scenes , but was surprised to favor the non-talking jungle scenes . Okay , GIANT English speaking SNAKES are exempt from the previous sentence . I did like the pursuit of the ordinary non-speaking tiger . Admittedly , I'm not a " Jungle Book " movie fan , but I do recall seeing another version ; and , this one is better . . .

452729	15896852	43526	6.0	Goo Goo Ga Ga ( Their Blessed Event )	At first , I was hoping " Father's Little Dividend " was going to be about Joan Bennett's character becoming pregnant ; then , Spencer Tracy dealing with a new baby of his own ! In the beginning of the film , Mr . Tracy shows some very amorous interest / contact with Ms . Bennett ; and , she certainly looks young enough to be pregnant . I guess Tracy and Bennett were being " careful " ; because , all too predictably , Elizabeth Taylor becomes the expectant . I see the " middle class " Banks ' still employ their maid " Delilah " ; despite their worries about money , they didn't have to " let her go " after the wedding bills rang . . . This is a pleasant enough sequel , but having " the stork " visit Bennett & Tracy , instead of Taylor & Taylor , might have made " Father's Little Dividend " ( 1951 ) even better than the original " Father of the Bride " ( 1950 ) . Father's Little Dividend ( 1951 ) Vincente Minnelli - Spencer Tracy , Joan Bennett , Elizabeth Taylor
452987	15896852	61122	6.0	Smoking in the Girls Room	Rosalind Russell is the Mother Superior of a Catholic school invaded by troubled young women Hayley Mills ( she's Mary ) and her cohort June Harding ( she's Rachel ) . Ms . Mills and Ms . Harding don't want to be in the stuffy convent school ; predictably , they become the resident Juvenile Delinquents . Can Mother Superior turn their lives around ? The story is very weak . For 1966 , you wonder what all the fuss was about . The girls smoke in the bathroom and boiler room ( which is mistaken for a fire ) . When the girls mention idols Jack Lemmon and Kim Novak , you know the screenplay was not even made contemporary to 1966 ( originally , the story took place several decades earlier ) . AND , can you believe a Mother superior plucking and painting her eyebrows quite like Ms . Russell ? BUT , the movie works . The strength of the players carries you along . Mills and Harding could be smoking pot - - it doesn't matter ; the message is relayed . Russell's reaction to the girls ' band uniforms works for the same reason ; the uniforms are not shocking , but you know how Russell feels ( note director Ida Lupino's close-up during this scene ) . The strength of the performances make " The Trouble with Angels " more successful than it looks on paper . The theme / ending is VERY predictable ; but , note that Mother Superior also changes - - by the " cocktail dress " scene , her character has become more like her unmanageable twosome .

453056	15896852	54988	6.0	Something Is Rotten in Denmark	Obviously intended to frighten , director William Castle's psycho trip , instead , amuses . Joan Marshall ( as Emily ) ' s homicidal performance may be unconvincing on a technical level ; but , she performs it endearingly , and with a straight face . Glenn Corbett ( as Karl ) and Patricia Breslin ( as Miriam ) are an attractive vis a vis . And , Eugenie Leontovich ( as Helga ) is a " knock-out " ( note : stroke victims may want to see what else is on ) . Don't miss the beginning , when Ms . Marshall propositions handsome bellhop Richard Rust for marriage , but not sex , then loses control on her wedding day . Also , enjoy Burnett Guffey's photography . " Homicidal " screams out for a TV-movie or home video remake , with the " fight break " replaced by a " bathroom break " .

452682	15896852	213149	6.0	I Think World War II Just Farted	Michael Bay's " Pearl Harbor " is terrific , explosive , exciting , and technically well-made . John Schwartzman's photography , and the film's effects , are outstanding ; and , many of the supporting performances would have been exceptional , in a better story . Unfortunately , this film is far too long , and focuses on a the lamest possible retelling of the eternal " love triangle " during a war setting . The film's length is not justifiable . First of all , the Japanese segments are pointless ; since there is no attempt to portray them accurately , or with substance , they should have remained in the shadows . Secondly , the underused supporting cast's stories are even not worthy of inclusion . For example , Cuba Gooding Jr . appears to receive a medal , due to his race , apparently . And , Jon Voight appears to do his Franklin D . Roosevelt impression . But , Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler appear as themselves . So , wasn't the real Roosevelt good enough ? Ben Affleck ( as Rafe McCawley ) , Josh Hartnett ( as Danny Walker ) , and Kate Beckinsale ( as Evelyn Johnson ) make up the starring threesome ; and , they are earnest and attractive , playing out the storyline like they were acting in an old movie . Still , there really isn't anything to this trio ; compare them , for starters , with the extraordinary characterizations in the silent " Wings " ( 1927 ) . Then , see " From Here to Eternity " ( 1953 ) . Either of those film's stories would have been preferable to this non-smoking " Pearl Harbor " . It's all so obviously contrived and predictable ; and , with such good production values , a certain level of disappointment is assured .

453496	15896852	118113	6.0	How to Win Friends and Influence People ( Not )	Catherine Keener ( as Amelia ) spends the opening scenes putting down everyone in her life . She doesn't like best friend Anne Heche ( as Laura ) ' s engagement ring . She calls video store geek Kevin Corrigan ( as Bill ) , who wants to date her , " The Ugly Guy " . She repeatedly calls ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Liev Schreiber ( as Andrew ) an ass - - - - , for enjoying telephone sex . Her cat has cancer . And , her kitchen sponge stinks . Intriguing character study , from writer / director Nicole Holofcener . Ms . Keener's " Amelia " seems to have a lot going for her ; she is funny and attractive , and , she manages to keep friendships while being excessively judgmental . Things may have started going wrong for her when roommate Heche moved in with boyfriend Todd Field ( as Frank ) . Mr . Field becomes another supportive friend , however . Although Keener is cranky throughout , she eventually proves to be an interesting , supportive friend . The performances are all terrific . Mr . Corrigan may be most memorable , as the horror movie geek Keener labels " The Ugly Guy " ; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine . Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly , though . Then , again , hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn't so ugly . Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff ( as Peter ) play a waiter so well , and an actor so poorly . " Walking and Talking " manages to be a story about meaningful friendship without being terribly meaningful . Walking and Talking ( 1996 ) Nicole Holofcener - Catherine Keener , Anne Heche , Kevin Corrigan
452771	15896852	56937	6.0	The Queen of Denial	Beautifully busted Elizabeth Taylor ( as Cleopatra ) copulates with seething lover Richard Burton ( as Mark Antony ) , after godly lover Rex Harrison ( as Julius Caesar ) becomes indisposed . The threesome do not perform their best work ; and , neither of the men pair very memorably with Ms . Taylor . Off screen , Taylor and Mr . Burton were lovers - but , that " chemistry " doesn't show . Taylor had proved herself a worthy actress up until " Cleopatra " - but , in this role , she faltered . Most of the time , she is modeling rather than acting . In fact , Taylor was beyond this role ( which should have been offered to someone like Sophia Loren ) ; but , the money was good ? Despite all that , the film is incredibly gorgeous . The reputation of " Cleopatra " as either a flop or failure isn't entirely true . Its flaws are obvious , but so are its strengths . The " Academy Awards " for cinematography , sets , costumes , and special effects are earned ( more or less ) . Roddy McDowall ( as Octavian ) should have received a " Best Supporting Actor " nomination , also . Writer / director Joseph L . Mankiewicz and crew do not create an extraordinary finished product ; but , there are individual scenes and sequences of great beauty . The direction and photography help make the film's running time more tolerable . Better than its reputation , and marginally recommended . Cleopatra ( 1963 ) Joseph L . Mankiewicz - Elizabeth Taylor , Richard Burton , Rex Harrison
453391	15896852	56860	6.0	Frankie and Annette Catch a Wave	It's a colorful southern California summer of 1963 . Swinging surfer Frankie Avalon ( as Frankie ) takes beautiful girlfriend Annette Funicello ( as Dolores ) to a beach shack for some house playing ; but , the couple's teenage friends have already crashed the place . Soon , the fit young vacationers are in their tight swimsuits - - singing , dancing , and romancing in the sand . They don't know it ( yet ) , but anthropologist Robert Cummings ( as Professor Sutwell ) is peeping through his binoculars at the teenagers ' " mating habits " ; he and secretary Dorothy Malone ( as Marianne ) have arrived to study the sex lives of the younger set . The characters meet at Morey Amsterdam ( as Cappy ) ' s beer joint , where Ms . Funicello develops interest in Mr . Cummings , after Mr . Avalon gets lewd with waitress Eva Six ( as Ava ) . Harvey Lembeck ( as Eric Von Zipper ) and his motorcycle gang are around to cause even more friction , until Cummings gives " Zipper " the finger . Director William Asher's first " Beach Party " is , while it doesn't contain the best writing of the series , a cut above the other films . The performances , led by Avalon and Funicello , are fresh and natural . Subsequent films , while they boast some individually entertaining elements , lack the spontaneity herein . There are also , you'll notice , details " toned down " over the course of the series . In this " Beach Party " , bathing suits and camera angles seem tighter , and sexier , than usual . The music is perfect ; appropriately , they chose Dick Dale and his Del-Tones to perform songs written by Gary Usher and Roger Christian . Funicello's double-tracked " Treat Him Nicely " ( by Hemric-Styner ) and Avalon's lascivious " Don't Stop Now " ( by Marcucci-Faith ) were great single songs , and should have been bigger hits . Where else are you going to find Annette Funicello , in a hot pink two-piece , exclaim " Isn't it a hooting day !

452827	15896852	33627	6.0	Sauerkraut in Canada	One of the more interesting World War II propaganda films , due to outstanding writing ( by Emeric Pressburger ) , direction ( by Michael Powell ) , and performances . The opening credits and sequences may be confusing . The story involves six Nazis making their way from Hudson Bay ( in northeastern Canada ) to cross the " 49th Parallel " ( the United States / Canadian border ) , after their U-boat ( submarine warship ) is damaged . At the time the film was made , the U . S . would have been a " safe " ( neutral ) country . Also , the film does not " star " Leslie Howard and Lawrence Olivier - rather , the lead actor is Eric Portman ( as Hirth ) . Mr . Portman and crew do very well in their roles . The most interesting aspect of the film is that the Germans are written to include a " good " Nazi , who wavers in his support for the Fuehrer . The most satisfying of the film's loosely threaded stories involves the " good " Nazi bonding with a Canadian immigrant settlement , led by Anton Walbrook ( as Peter ) . This , and the segment with Raymond Massey ( as Andy Brock ) , is where you'll find the filmmakers delivering their most palpable ( and eloquent ) sermonettes . The film is too episodic for its own good - one story , with more focus on Portman's crew , would have sufficed . 49th Parallel ( / 41 ) Michael Powell - Eric Portman , Leslie Howard , Laurence Olivier
452950	15896852	74258	6.0	No Fire	Happily married Karen Black and Oliver Reed ( as Marian and Ben Rolf ) rent a beautiful , but weird , Gothic mansion for the summer . Moving in with them are young son Lee Montgomery ( as David Rolf ) and smoking Bette Davis ( as Aunt Elizabeth ) . The quartet of tenants face accidents , arguments , and ever-increasing danger . Director Dan Curtis would have been wiser to use his third theatrical film to re-tell the original " Laura the Phoenix " story from his TV series " Dark Shadows " . The title " Burnt Offerings " would have been perfect ; and , the story is vaguely compatible . With its chilling Robert Cobert music , the film tone resembles 1971 " Shadows " ; but , the plot is disjointed and somewhat confusing . There appear to be two creepy stories . One involves the House ; and , the other hints at some incident from Ben Rolf's past . The two story threads are never fully connected , and neither is explained as well as they should be . More than a little viewer analysis is required to " fill in the blanks " . Still , you get the amazing Ms . Davis , shining in a " nice old lady " role . And , Curtis favorites Ms . Black and Mr . Montgomery are also very good . Burnt Offerings ( 1976 ) Dan Curtis - Karen Black , Oliver Reed , Bette Davis
452588	15896852	56891	6.0	Hello , Ann-Margret !	Don't expect this to be a faithful adaptation of the stage hit , starring Dick Van Dyke ( as Albert ) , with a black-wigged Janet Leigh ( as Rosie ) attractively shouting " Ole ! " Instead , this is a showcase for the delicious Ann-Margret ( as Kim ) . Ms . Margret , with the co-operation of director George Sidney , pulls the rug out from under everyone and everything in sight . Although miscast ( " a child of fifteen " ! ) as a star-struck teenager , Ms . Margret is a delight . Watching her perform must have made moviegoers feel like star-struck teenagers . The thirtysomething ( but drafted ! ) " Elvis " - inspired Jesse Pearson ( as Conrad Birdie ) suffers , in comparison . But , so do most of the cast ? Though nowhere near as successful as it should be , " Bye Bye Birdie " is worth watching . Most of all , for Ann-Margret's breakout performance as a 1960s sex symbol . The production number " A Lot of Living to Do " ( perhaps inspired by Presley's similarly titled " Loving You " tune ) easily goes to the head of the class - with Ann-Margret , Bobby Rydell ( as Hugo ) , and troupe performing admirably and energetically . Ironically , Mr . Rydell is successfully cast . In " real life " , Rydell was the type of " teen idol " the film was unsuccessfully satirizing . The other musical numbers are fair to middling ( the " Moscow ballet " is poor ) . You do get to see Dick Van Dyke " Put on a Happy Face " ( in his first feature film ) , and Paul Lynde's observations on " Kids ! " - but , both performers improved upon the renditions offered herein . Matronly Maureen Stapleton adds some weight to the cast . Ed Sullivan fills a flattering supporting role . All things considered , it's Ann-Margret's " really big shew " , with Rydell and the production's " kids " doing their best to help out .

" Mr . Dean ( as Latham ) plays a restless young man from Wisconsin , who has just ended his stint in Korea . With little luck hitchhiking after dark , Dean enters the diner , and orders coffee and a sandwich . Dean goes behind the counter to fix proprietor Murvyn Vye ( as Mike Deegan ) ' s broken coffee pot , revealing he's worked in diners . Mr .

Though disillusioned , Dean stays in town , intending to avoid criminal activity . Mr . Stehli and Vye , however , have other plans . Vye tricks Dean into transporting some stolen goods ; and , while driving on an " unlighted road " , Dean's car draws gunfire . Dean's speedy attempt to get away causes the other car to swerve out of control , and crash . Racing back to the diner , Dean learns the other driver , a state trooper , has died . Now a " cop killer " , Dean must choose to work for gangster Stehli , or turn himself over to the police . . . Appearing after the premiere of " East of Eden " , this short drama was no great shakes , relatively speaking . Still , " The Unlighted Road " is a neat little play . Writer Walter C .

The young couple is quickly separated by Allie's upper-class parents who insist that Noah isn't right for her . Several years pass , and , when they meet again , their passion is rekindled , forcing Allie to choose between her soul mate and class order . This beautiful tale has a particularly special meaning to an older gentleman ( James Garner ) who regularly reads the timeless love story to his aging companion ( Gena Rowlands ) , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " The Notebook " is a pretty and predictable love story . Mr . Gosling and Ms . McAdams never seemed ( to me ) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr . Garner and Ms . Rowlands . Many times , the younger lovers appear to be modeling , rather than playing , their roles . The older couple is more enjoyable . Garner's performance , and narration , is particularly strong . James Marsden ( as Lon Hammond ) and Joan Allen ( as Anne Hamilton ) have interesting , underdeveloped roles . ( Ms . Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's " Lois Farrow " ) . The " teenage " , and later , undressing scenes are very funny . And , some of the characters ' implausible actions ( the 365 letters , for example ) could be explained as embellishments and / or enhancements made by Rowlands ' character , in her " The Story of Our Lives " account . It is interesting that the lead characters write , at different times , a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time . With the exceptions of Robert Fraisse's photography and Gosling's dirty undershirt , the film applies too much gloss .

452826	15896852	24539	6.0	Mary Pickford Blows Out the Candles	In director Frank Borzage's 1924 original version of this film , the character " Mary Carlton " ( played by a matured Norma Talmadge ) looks back on her life , and its " Secrets " . For this re-make , Mary Pickford ( as Mary Marlowe ) is initially photographed to appear as young as possible . Later , Ms . Pickford is " aged " ( although , she is photographed in soft focus throughout ) . So , the entire " framing " of the film - as about an old woman looking back on the " Secrets " of her life - is lost . Moreover , the movie misses an opportunity to startle audiences by opening with an " aged " Pickford . " Secrets " is not a bad film - but , it is frustrating to look at a miscalculation , in this last career appearance for Mary Pickford . Both Pickford and Borzage should have had the storytelling wherewithal to go ahead with the " old age " framing . Borzage had success with Talmadge's version , and Pickford supported Charlotte Smith ( her mother ) in Thomas H . Ince's similarly structured " Sweet Memories " ( 1911 ) . Without the framing , the story blindly lurches , uncomfortably , through the years . Pickford surely knew audiences weren't responding well to her recent features , and likely made what she thought were wise decisions about the filming of " Secrets " . So , it is a first class production . This shows in Pickford's selection of director Borzage , photographer Ray June , and co-star Leslie Howard ( as John Carlton ) . Mr . June's photography is beautiful . Mr . Howard , a stage star close to Pickford's own age , is a smart choice for leading man . Ironically , Howard looks much younger than his years . Pickford's choice of vehicle and co-star reveal her continued belief in " stage " acting as a way to succeed in talking pictures . To her portrayal , Pickford adds some of the cutesy mannerisms which came to be expected by fans , but plagued much of her later work . These factors help mar her overall performance . Yet , watch for a stand-out scene featuring Pickford and a baby , played silently , during the film's " western " portion . Pickford and Howard would never appear on film into their 70s , which makes the ending of " Secrets " a sweet farewell . Secrets ( / 33 ) Frank Borzage - Mary Pickford , Leslie Howard , Mona Maris
453085	15896852	98230	6.0	From Flashback to Déjà Vu	In 1969 , peace loving hippies Eric Roberts ( as Fred ) and Cheech Marin ( as Hesus ) flee to Central America , to avoid being drafted into Vietnam War service . Why the US government believes Mr . Marin would be of any real use during warfare is never explained ; but , Mr . Roberts looks like a major Commie-killing loss . Anyway , they spend the next 20 years hiding in the jungle , smoking marijuana , and enjoying peace . Their hippie friends , Julie Hagerty ( as Petra ) and Robert Carradine ( as Sammy ) , remain behind . While in Central America , Roberts and Marin learn about a US invasion plan , and decide to return to New York , and stop the war . They are in for a rude awakening . . . In 1989 , the peace movement appears dead . Roberts and Marin try to adapt to the changes in American society . They try to re-connect with Ms . Hagerty and Mr . Carradine , who have become materialistic yuppies . How can they erase their friends ' 1980s brainwashing , avoid capture by perseverating FBI man Cliff De Young ( as Brubaker ) , and stop the war ? Aaron Russo and Neil Levy's underrated " Rude Awakening " certainly doesn't always work ; but , it's funny more often than not . Roberts and Marin are almost a satirical casting in-joke ( sixties , meet the eighties ) . One of the film's most obvious misses is that the main attempt to transcend a 20-year-gap is an unconvincing pair of pasted-on beards . Although , to answer Roberts ' later , more general question , " How's my hair ? " Great . It's impossible to hold back laughing at Marin's first meeting with the " fish " . But , they should have used Don Knotts voice . Of the four " hippie " friends , Carradine's is , performance-wise , most convincing . Check out Louise Lasser ( as Ronnie ) ' s customers ! The highlight of the film is a terrific " cocktail party " hosted by Carradine and uptight wife Cindy Williams ( as June ) . They are visited by the " Stools " , Buck Henry ( as Lloyd ) and Andrea Martin ( as April ) . A cocktail party attended by Cheech Marin , Eric Roberts , Robert Carradine , Buck Henry , Cindy Williams , and Andrea Martin is every bit as funny as it sounds . If only they could have figured out how to get Lasser there ( and the overhead mike out ) . There are enough funny moments , all around ; but , the hilarious supporting characterizations by Martin and Williams , alone , make this well worth watching .

453416	15896852	651	6.0	Trick of the Trade	A smoking newspaper boy takes a break , to play in the street with messenger boy pal Robert Harron ( as Swifty ) . When they notice a couple of mysterious men follow a well-dressed woman , the newspaper boy decides to play " The Boy Detective " . Sure enough , the men are crooked . With help from his friend , a disguise , and ingenuity , the newspaper boy plans to foil the criminals . It's nicely photographed by G . W . Bitzer , with some good angles ; however , the camera is sometimes unsure . Wallace McCutcheon directed . Edward Dillon is notable as one of the villains ; he played Mr . Harron's father in the unfortunately lost " Bobby's Kodak " . More notable , perhaps , for Harron's supporting role ; and , the Hoboken , New Jersey location footage is beautiful .
452494	15896852	32143	6.0	Putting The Women in Their Place	After Norma Shearer ( as Mary ) discovers her husband is having an affair with Joan Crawford ( as Crystal ) , she learns women must not be proud . Rosalind Russell ( as Sylvia ) leads an MGM parade of supporting players - all women ; in fact , only women appear in the film ! But , don't expect a " feminist " statement from George Cukor's " The Women " . The message may waver , but it never really gets too far away from putting women in their place . If the film is about anything other than being faithful and subservient to your man , it's about gossip . It could have been titled " Gossip " . What's appealing about " The Women " is enjoying some of its fine , albeit dated , dialog and situations . There are scores of actresses to watch ; Ms . Shearer and Ms . Russell come off best , but appreciators of any will like their favorites . Ms . Crawford likes to smoke in her bathtub . The film's fun is severely weakened by an extremely distracting interlude - the " Fashion Show " - which is presented in COLOR . " Gimmicks " like the color segment and the all female cast ruin " The Women " ; and , the acceptance of a " double standard " for men and women is presented as part of a great woman's character .

453314	15896852	12754	6.0	Let There Be L7	In the old west , home-seeker William S . Hart ( as Ben Trego ) finds a dreamy spot to build , for himself and his twin boys . Unfortunately , there are savage Indians ( aka Native Americans ) around ; obviously , they haven't studied " manifest destiny " . To protect his motherless sons from Indians , Mr . Hart blows himself up . Although Hart's pioneer-man is eventually memorialized ( " Trego County " , " Trego Valley " ) ; his twins are separated , after being sent to an orphanage . They grow up to be William S . Hart ( in two additional roles , as Bill Brand and Paul Marsden ) . Hart as " Bill Brand " is a rancher ; he is affectingly called " Three Word Brand " , due to his economy with words . Hart as " Paul Marsden " is the newly elected Governor of Utah . Rancher Hart and partner S . J . Bingham ( as George Barton ) find the " L7 " ranch threatened by nasty neighbor Gordon Russell ( as Bull Yeates ) . Mr . Russell frames Mr . Bingham for murder ; and plots to take the " L7 " from Hart . Russell's lovely young sister , Jan Novak ( as Ethel Barton ) , is Hart's romantic interest . It's nice to see Hart in a dual role ( not counting his fatherly introduction ) ; however , " Three Word Brand " doesn't really take advantage of its dramatic possibilities . Hart's characterizations are surprisingly one-dimensional for an actor who played " good / bad " duality so memorably ; but , the script doesn't offer him much opportunity . Hart's highlights occurs later in the film , when his simple Rancher twin ( " Brand " ) impersonates the more sophisticated Governor twin ( " Marsden " ) . It's nicely photographed , and mostly enjoyable , despite a certain lack of excitement .
453297	15896852	43390	6.0	Return to Sender !	Loretta Young acts up a storm as a woman ( Ellen ) married to a terminally ill man ( George ) who believes she is planning to murder him . Husband Barry Sullivan composes a letter to the District Attorney , explaining how exactly Young will commit the murder ? The film is a showcase for Young , and she delivers a fine performance . The story , however , is very hard to accept . There are many things happening on the screen which needed to be more fully explained . For starters , the husband's illnesses - how does his heart condition affect his mind as manifested on screen ? Then , there are several actions Young takes which do not seem to be the choices most level-headed thinking individuals would take . So , maybe she's not exactly a level-headed thinking individual ?

452415	15896852	14672	6.0	Love Is Blind	Appropriately subtitled " Love and Sacrifice " , director D . W . Griffith's fictionalized account of revolutionary " America " should have been more successful , given the obvious costly effort in evidence ; it is weighted down by lack of imagination , and a significantly unsuitable performance from the leading actress . Still , it offers many worthwhile scenes ; and , some legendary scenes are brought beautifully to life . Griffith gentlemanly reveals prejudices early , explaining , " The story of the sacrifice made for freedom in the American Revolution is that of a civil war between two groups of English people ; one group , the Americans , being merely Englishmen who settled on the American Continent . " Moreover , Griffith asserts , " The government which Canada and Australia now enjoy was absolutely denied to America through the stubborn and false ideals of the autocratic powers guiding the hand of King George the Third . " During the running time , Griffith uses Royalist Walter Butler to represent the evil on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean . Were it not for Mr . Butler , the Revolution might have been settled amicability ! Not as despicable a thesis as presented Griffith's similarly plotted Civil War epic , but neither is " America " as excitingly presented as " The Birth of a Nation " . And , try as they might , Neil Hamilton ( as Nathan Holden ) and Carol Dempster ( as Nancy Montague ) are not Robert Harron and Lillian Gish in " Hearts of the World " . Griffith's epics are much more convincing with when characterizations and relationships are well presented . Mr . Hamilton , as the poor young New Englander , has no rapport with Ms . Dempster . And , as the Virginia belle , Dempster is wrongly directed . Compare Dempster / Hamilton with Gish / Harron in " Hearts of the World " . Or , even better , with Gish / Harron in " A Romance of Happy Valley " . The later film shows how well Ms . Gish and Mr . Harron played the " bedroom window " scene which Griffith re-visits in " America " . Hamilton , a promising actor , had a great career highlight , later , as " Commissioner Gordon " of " Batman " in the 1960s ; but , ribald Lionel Barrymore ( as Butler ) steals the acting honors . Griffith used his stars better in the forthcoming " Isn't Life Wonderful ? "
453371	15896852	210844	6.0	The Legionnaire Who Killed	" Two French Foreign Legionnaires are lost amid the shifting sands of the Sarah Dessert when they stumble across the entrance to an underground world . Searching this new found subterranean passage , our heroes are surprised to find the lost city of Atlantis . Ruling over this fantastic underworld realm , an evil queen sets her sights upon these strangers to her kingdom , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . To begin , Legionnaire John Stuart ( as André de Saint-Avit ) responds to modern speculation about the lost city of Atlantis by proclaiming he and partner Gustav Diessl ( as Jean Morhange ) actually visited the legendary city . A flashback recounts the men being kidnapped , and brought to Atlantis ; it is still in existence , a labyrinth beneath the Sarah Desert . Beautiful and bewitching Brigitte Helm ( as Antinea ) is the city's ruler ; descended from ancient queens , she has an insect-like agenda for the men caught in her web . Extraordinarily directed ( by G . W . Pabst ) and photographed ( by Eugen Schüfftan and Ernst Körner ) , " The Mistress of Atlantis " offers a lot of eye-appeal ; but its storyline suffers considerably , in comparison . Searching for information on Pierre Benoit's original novel , " L'Atlantide " , will uncover the sexuality buried in the mix . Ms . Helm and Mathias Wieman ( as Ivar Torstenson ) heat things up a little , however . " Die Herrin von Atlantis " ( 1932 ) , the German version , must be considered definitive .

He has everything except " Black Suede Shoes " . One evening , he discovers a woman being roughed up in an alley / alcove . While in a nearby phone booth , calling for help , Pitt is practically hit over the head with his blessed " Black Suede Shoes " . Then , he feels he is on his way . Pitt is hampered by an underwhelming singing voice , and poor material ; but , due to his muscular good looks , he is successful with women . Pitt has several sexy underwear scenes ; and , he slips under the sheets with quirky Catherine Keener ( as Yvonne ) and alluring Alison Moir ( as Darlette ) . Pitt idolizes Ricky Nelson ( who certainly would have gotten a kick out of this movie ) . For the record , the most frequently played song , Rick Nelson's " Teen Age Idol " could not have been turned over to play " Travelin ' Man " , as Pitt does in an effective scene with Ms . Moir . The two Nelson hits were on different Imperial singles . The record album hanging on Pitt's apartment wall is the excellent " Ricky Sings Again " album . " Midtown " is the best of the " original " tunes ; it has some of the breezy feel evident in Nelson's early Decca material . Moir , Ms . Keener , and Calvin Levels ( as Deke ) perform very well . Keener won an " Independent Spirit Award " ; but , Moir and Mr . Leeds are also very impressive . Tempting Tina Louise ( as Mrs . Fontaine ) , from " Gilligan's Island " , has a leggy cameo ; and , Nick Cave is a " Freak Storm " . Debuting director Tom DiCillo's " Johnny Suede " is filled with style and good intentions .

452431	15896852	5060	6.0	Geraldine Farrar Hits the Screen as Carmen	Geraldine Farrar ( as Carmen ) is a Gypsy involved with a gang of smugglers ; to help them , she agrees to deflect Officer Wallace Reid ( as Don Jose ) ' s attention with a seduction . Mr . Reid is so smitten with Ms . Farrar , he decides to pursue her ; but Farrar only has eyes for bullfighter Pedro de Cordoba ( as Escamillo ) ? Farrar , with a flower in her teeth , is unintentionally amusing ( and not very convincing to modern eyes ) as a seductress . Nonetheless , she was a big Metropolitan Opera star , and Bizet's " Carmen " proved to be a popular film debut . In fact , Motion Picture Magazine conducted an extensive poll to determine " Screen Masterpieces of Acting " . and Farrar's " Carmen " was the best female performance of the year 1915 ; she outpolled not only Mae Marsh ( in " Birth of a Nation " ) and Mary Pickford ( in " Rags " ) , but also Theda Bara in a competing version of " Carmen " . A movie highlight is Farrar letting her hair down and cat-fighting with another woman in the cigarette factory where they work - and almost ripping the other woman's shirt off ! Reid is a very handsome leading man , who doesn't overact throughout ; making a scene where he nearly rapes Farrar more convincing . Mr . de Cordoba always uses his eyes to great advantage . Cecil B . DeMille shows improvement as a director - near the end , Farrar and de Cordoba play a nicely staged scene before the bullfight ; though , Farrar ruins it by approaching the camera like she's going to take a bow . After the bullfight , Reid and Farrar take more " affective " bows . Carmen ( / 15 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Geraldine Farrar , Wallace Reid , Pedro de Cordoba

Wallace Beery ( as Bill Hawkes ) , the " Stool Pidgeon " who played a part in her father's death , raises Ms . Dean to be an accomplished London pickpocket . Meanwhile , enterprising Mr . Griffith scams pawns as " The Mechanical Chess-player " . Mr . Beery , who calls himself " Count Donelli " invites Griffith to join himself and Dean . Soon , the unholy trio travel to New York's Fifth Avenue ; there , they plan their biggest heist . Tod Browning's " White Tiger " is entertainingly performed , and directed . Later in the running time , Matt Moore ( as Richard Longworth ) makes the troupe a fine acting quartet . The story situation requires too great a suspension of disbelief , however . You'll may wonder why Griffith and Dean don't dope things out sooner ( just for starters ) . The " White Tiger " referred to in the title is , by the way , the criminal element that lives in the heart of the unholy criminal : " Fawning and hating the strong , ready to ravage the weak , faithless ? suspicious ? cruel and savage , fearing no God ? trusting no man ? that's White Tiger in the heart of the crook !

Beautifully choreographed and directed , " Viva Las Vegas " is one of the best Elvis movies . The " Elvis Presley Movie Formula " is well-represented . His performance is confident and relaxed . He has a co-star of worth in Ann-Margret ; clearly , they enhance each other's performance . The title song is classic , heading up an extraordinary " Viva Las Vegas " soundtrack .

452540	15896852	190865	6.0	Chivalry Is Not Dead	The first ten minutes , or thereabouts , of Martin Campbell's " Vertical Limit " are very engrossing . You get the feeling you're about to see one terrific movie . Now , there are many more great minutes to be enjoyed ; but , the story never gets any further off the ground . The opening introduces the film's leading man and woman , handsome Chris O'Donnell ( as Peter Garrett ) and winsome sister Robin Tunney ( as Annie Garrett ) . A mountain climbing mishap results in the death of their father . The story would have worked better if quickly expiring father Stuart Wilson ( as Royce Garrett ) had persuaded Ms . Tunney to " cut the rope " , and save Mr . O'Donnell . This would have matched their later career choices ; note , survivalist Tunney continues mountain climbing , while brother O'Donnell becomes a photographer . The gender reversal would have given an otherwise painfully ordinary script some real distinction , and it matches up with later events well . Still , you have a lot of excellent visual effects ; and , extraordinary photography and location shooting by Mr . Campbell , with cinematographer David Tattersall . The film is set in New Zealand ( as Pakistan ) . Immoral billionaire Bill Paxton ( as Elliot Vaughn ) and vengeful veteran Scott Glenn ( Montgomery Wick ) try to give the story some weight . The " K2 " mountain is a central , inanimate " character " ; but , like the humans , it is underdeveloped . " Vertical Limit " is not Chekhov , and it's not Melville ? but it's okay .

Later , inmate Charles Hill Mailes ( a Lunatic ) loses it , cops a gun from Alfred Paget ( a Guard ) , and escapes . Mr .

Upon graduation , Ms . Stanwyck gets a job as " Night Nurse " to a pair of plump looking children ; she suspects the well fed looking kids are being starved to death , possibly by their drunken mother's gangster lover Clark Gable ( as Nick , the chauffeur ) . Soon , Stanwyck is in great danger ? Delightfully lurid melodrama , with star Stanwyck in fine form ( she and Blondell are seen are often shown undressing , by the way ) .

Salisbury has a fondness for betting on the horses , and pilfers money from the fund . For the sake of family honor , Mr . Farnum accepts responsibility for the missing funds , and sails off to America . Farnum buys a ranch , befriends the local Indians ( Native Americans ) , and feuds with wicked William Elmer ( as Cash Hawkins ) . When Salisbury dies , on the Swiss Alps , widow Winifred Kingston ( as Diana ) wants to bring Farnum home to England , but he's settled in America with Squaw Red Wing ( as Nat-u-ritch ) ? Due to its relatively long length , this is sometimes called the first feature film . It is also the noted as first feature filmed in Hollywood , California ; but , you wouldn't know it - the Farnum ranch looks like Hollywood ( check out the background ) , but the more memorable ship trek and heavy snowfall scenes can't be Hollywood ( obviously ) . It's the first film by director Cecil B . DeMille , who shows some promise ( in hindsight ) . There are no great performances ; Dustin Farnum was an important stage actor , getting acquainted with film . I thought Farnum was best and most impressive in the scenes with his " half-breed " son ( who looks NOTHING like his Indian mother ) . Billy Elmer was entertaining in what should have been a larger role ( Cash Hawkins ) . I found " The Squaw Man " confusing - some of the events and relationships are like . . . " fill in the blanks " . The Indian / Englishman relationship was , perhaps , daring for an early film theme ( if you can figure out what's going on ) ; and , Ms . Wing was a real Winnebago Indian actress . The Squaw Man ( 1914 ) Cecil B . DeMille , Oscar Apfel - Dustin Farnum , Red Wing , William Elmer
452716	15896852	50882	6.0	Speak of Angels and Hear Their Wings	Idealistic Montgomery Clift ( as John Shawnessy ) is distracted by buxom Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor ( as Susanna Drake ) , and marries her instead of pretty sweetheart Eva Marie Saint ( as Nell Gaither ) . Life with Ms . Taylor proves to be a cursed existence , so Mr . Clift takes refuge as a Union soldier , after the United States Civil War breaks out . Of course , Clift is on the winning side of the war - but , his personal search for happiness , in an Eden called " Raintree County " , is a more difficult path to manage . . . Clearly , MGM was hoping for something approaching " Gone with the Wind " - and , they failed . However , " Raintree County " is not so bad , when viewed without the comparative eye . The big budget production values are beautiful ; the obvious expense , and the cast , helps maintain interest in the relatively weak storyline . And , it does get better , as the starring triad ( Clift , Taylor , and Saint ) slowly draw you into their lives . Viewing will require some degree of commitment , though ; it's a long movie . Early in the filming , Clift left a visit with friends at Taylor's home , and drove his car into a telephone pole . He nearly died , and his facial " reconstruction " is obvious throughout most of " Raintree County " . Clift's performance is uneven , also - but , he was too good an actor to be completely derailed . And , Clift is better than you might have heard . Also , he , does not look as bad as many have claimed . The eventual toll on his " looks " was mainly taken by a growing dependence on alcohol and painkillers . Taylor , who is credited with saving Clift's life , shows some of the sparkle that would quickly make her one of the best actresses in the business , especially during the film's second half . Nigel Patrick , Lee Marvin , Rod Taylor , and Agnes Moorehead head up a strong supporting cast . Robert Surtees ' savory cinematography is noteworthy . And , Nat King Cole sings the Johnny Green title song , a minor hit , very sweetly . Raintree County ( 1957 ) Edward Dmytryk - Montgomery Clift , Elizabeth Taylor , Eva Marie Saint
453339	15896852	6826	6.0	Lucky Strikes	Friendless Mae Marsh has been left , as a baby , at " The Clarissa Parker Orphanage " , on Friday the thirteenth . Due to the superstitions associated with the date , she becomes known as " Hoodoo Ann " . Still , she " lives in sweet unconsciousness of her unhappy lot . " Young artist Robert Harron ( as James Vance ) lives in the same town , on Peaceful Street . One day , Ms . Marsh steals Mildred Harris ( as Goldie ) ' s doll , which seems to trigger some " hoodoo " ( bad luck ) in the form of a fire ; actually , the fire is caused by stepping on matches . Obviously , they are the self-striking kind of matches . Although Marsh hides the doll under a dirty mop , it cleans up well . The fire sequence is well done ; and Marsh becomes a heroine . This leads to her eventual adoption . After riding in a very cool looking early 1900s Ford automobile , Marsh is taken in by a kindly couple . " You are going to stay here and be our little girl , " they explain , dressing her in a very funny looking outfit . Marsh gratefully begins to scrub chairs . As luck would have it , Marsh discovers Mr . Harron is her new neighbor , and they begin to date . Harron takes Marsh to see a western move , which they enjoy ; oddly , the other members of the audience seem bored . Then , a shooting incident makes Marsh think her " hoodoo " has returned ? The director of record is Lloyd Ingraham ; but , it's a safe bet D . W . Griffith , who also wrote the scenario , helped out behind the camera . The story is rather absurd ; it's difficult to accept the legend of " hoodoo " based on Marsh's arrival date , and the superstitious palm-reading of " Black Cindy " ( Madame Sul-Te-Wan ) . The cast performs well , considering ; notably , young Mildred Harris caught Charlie Chaplin's eye . The folks running that orphanage must have had a parallel place , where they kept the older boys and younger girls . Though " Hoodoo Ann " has charms , they're much better presented in Griffith's similarly-themed , and highly recommended , 1918-19 films . Hoodoo Ann ( 1916 ) Lloyd Ingraham , D . W .

452536	15896852	57129	6.0	Julie Harris Sees Dead People	Nervous Julie Harris ( as Eleanor " Nell " Lance ) arrives to help investigate a reportedly haunted old dark house ; since she supposedly , as a child , was able to see ghosts . Also arriving are clairvoyant Claire Bloom ( as " Theo " Theodora ) , and the mansion's skeptical heir , Russ Tamblyn ( as Luke Sanderson ) . The three houseguests are led by anthropologist / parapsychologist Richard Johnson ( as John Markway ) . Mr . Johnson believes " Hill House " may definitively prove the existence of supernatural entities . Shirley Jackson's " The Haunting of Hill House " is similar to Henry James ' " Turn of the Screw " . Both are excellent psychological stories , involving the questionable participation of ghosts . This film adaptation is not as successful as 1961's " The Innocents " ( the cinematic version of " The Screw " ) . Possibly , this is due to the faithful rendering of Jackson's guilt-ridden protagonist being in " possession " of " ghosts " as a part of her psyche . " Eleanor " makes things up . So , you never see on-screen apparitions in Wise's " Haunting " . In James ' " Screw " , the ghosts seem more real ; their presence , in both works , is debated . " The Haunting " has a grand , eerie " look " , thanks to angling director Robert Wise , and Gothic photography by Davis Boulton . Ms . Bloom's subtly homosexual performance is another highlight . But , in the end , it's a long , underdeveloped , and relatively spook-free melodrama . The Haunting ( 1963 ) Robert Wise - Julie Harris , Claire Bloom , Russ Tamblyn

The farmer does the manual work , laboring in the fields . The wealth businessman reaps the profits , in luxury . In the film , Mr . Powell's character becomes more and more greedy , making the price of goods so high the poor farmers can't afford the goods they helped create . Of the supporting players , Henry B . Walthall is most impressive as Kirkwood's associate . Griffith mixes location and set nicely . Watch the wicked " Wheat King " meet a pitiful , ironic end in the " Corner in Wheat " .

Griffith didn't direct his own version of the classic ( not that he didn't come close , on a few occasions ) . Mr . Lloyd's Griffith-like direction is a plus ; though , it's somehow not as good as the original . William Farnum , who was one of the leading actors of the teens , does a fine job in the leading role ; seeing Mr . Farnum play both as reluctant French nobleman " Charles Darnay " and English alcoholic lawyer " Sydney Carton " is , today , the main attraction . While filled with decent performances , the more famous sound re-makes lose something by casting different men in the lead roles . Beautiful Jewel Carmen has no trouble attracting both men , as " Lucie Manette " . And , Florence Vidor ( King's wife ) sews up stardom on the way to the guillotine . " A Tale of Two Cities " was considered a top production in its time , but it doesn't possess the timeless quality you'll find in many other silent movies .

453684	15896852	24258	6.0	Ruth Chatterton's Life Is a Carnival	Ruth Chatterton ( as Lilly Turner ) impulsively marries handsome actor Gordon Westcott ( as Rex Durkee ) . Soon , Ms . Chatterton learns Mr . Westcott is a two-timer , who can't keep a job . Additionally , Westcott beats up Chatterton's pal Frank McHugh ( as Dave Dixon ) , who shows a fondness for alcohol . When Westcott's previous wife makes a surprise appearance , Chatterton learns he is a bigamist ; but , Westcott has taken off for parts unknown . Chatterton , left pregnant , accepts Mr . McHugh's marriage proposal ; and , the two try to make ends meet as carnival workers . Then , Chatterton falls for down-on-his-luck engineer George Brent ( as Bob Chandler ) , who soon replaces carnival strongman Robert Barrat ( as Fritz ) . Mr . Barrat has gone insane with love for Chatterton ; and , she is torn between her love for Mr . Brent and her loyalty for McHugh ? Less than spectacular , but competent , star vehicle for superstar Chatterton , ably directed by William A . Wellman . During this film , Brent and Chatterton were real-life husband and wife . Brent co-starred with the most popular actresses of the time ; though , he oftentimes comes across as rather ordinary , but is most appealing opposite Chatterton . McHugh gives an excellent supporting performance as Chatterton's alcoholic friend . Guy Kibbee and Marjorie Gateson are also highly watchable , as the amorous McGills .

Young Mr . Jordan secretly plans to spend the $200 reward money on new baseball uniforms for " The East Side Kids " . But , leader Leo Gorcey ( as Muggs McGinnis ) wants the money to be split seven ways , with fellow club-mates Stanley Clements ( as Stash ) , Huntz Hall ( as Glimpy ) , Bobby Stone ( as Skinny ) , Ernest Morrison ( as Scruno ) , and David Gorcey ( as Peewee ) . Misunderstandings put Jordan at odds with his former pals . And , bad becomes worse when former " East Side Kid " Gabriel Dell ( as Hank Salko ) returns , to warn the gang that Mr . Rosenbloom is out of prison , and prowling for Jordan . . . " Smart Alecks " uses its cast well . The film's line-up of performers is a classic , and the storyline is a good representation of this particular Bowery boy era . " Introducing Stanley ' Stash ' Clements " leads the credits ; a good addition to the team , Mr . Clements looks very much like he was brought in as a possible replacement for one of the Gorcey brothers ( which is more precisely what happened , in 1956 ) . And , Jordan's pretty sister Gale Storm ( as Ruth Stevens ) is a treat . Smart Alecks ( / 42 ) Wallace Fox - Bobby Jordan , Leo Gorcey , Stanley Clements
452955	15896852	117991	6.0	or , What They Won't	In William Shakespeare's " Twelfth Night " ( or , " What You Will " ) , brother and sister twins " Viola " and " Sebastian " are shipwrecked off the shores of " Illyria " . " Viola " mistakenly thinks brother " Sebastian " has drowned . She goes to " Illyria " alone ; and , she assumes the identity of a young man , " Cesario " . In " Illyria " , " Cesario " ( " Viola " ) gets a job as gentleman ( dresser ) for the duke " Orsino " . Male ( female ) " Cesario " ( " Viola " ) falls in love with ( male ) " Orsino " . But , he loves another woman , " Olivia " . Meanwhile , " Olivia " falls in love with the female twin " Cesario " ( " Viola " ) , thinking she is a male . Then , real male twin " Sebastian " returns , undead ! Then , all's well that ends well . The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right ( actually , they come off better , due to the overall execution of the film ) . But , mainly , it's about Imogen Stubbs ( as Viola aka Cesario ) , and her interaction with Toby Stephens ( as Orsino ) and Helena Bonham Carter ( as Olivia ) . This " Twelfth Night " is very well produced . It seems much more dramatic than comic , which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening . The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor , though . This portends a promising adaptation . But , the film doesn't really end up as you like it . Ms . Stubbs becomes an endearing " Viola " . Both Stubbs and Mr . Stephens , and Stubbs and Ms . Bonham Carter are fun to watch " fall in love " . The sexual dynamics work ; interestingly , each of the performers add some subtleties . Film , of course , picks up its own ( different than stage ) nuances . The already shaky premise falls apart , however , when " Sebastian " returns ; and , the performers lose credibility very quickly . Originally , a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins . It would have been better to have Stubbs ( or even Steven Mackintosh ) play both roles . This film points in the right direction ; but , next time , either go all the way , or leave " Twelfth Night " on the stage .

453671	15896852	80506	6.0	The Devil Is Loose Again !	" The investigation into the mysterious death of an aging Nazi war criminal hunter brings a surprising revelation to the cop working on the case . It appears the old man was actually following an individual with ties to the Nazis , who seems to have not aged in appearance in spite of the passage of over 30 ( sic ) years . The policeman and some other individuals decide to track down the mysterious individual to find out his horrifying secret , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The appropriately named Faith Clift ( as Dr . Claire Hansen ) and atheist writer husband Richard " Charles " Moll ( as James Hanson ) go to sinful Las Vegas to see the shows and promote Mr . Moll's book " God Is Dead " . Ms . Clift is troubled by nightmarish dreams about Nazis . Meanwhile , Marc Lawrence ( as Abraham Weiss ) , a blathering Jew , has traced Nazi war criminal Robert Bristol ( as Mr . Olivier ) to Vegas ; and , he reports the finding to police lieutenant Cameron Mitchell ( as Sterne ) . At first , Mr . Mitchell won't believe old Mr . Lawrence , because young Mr . Bristol hasn't aged in 35 years . " Cataclysm " ( aka " Satan's Supper " aka " The Nightmare Never Ends " ) is a classic " so-bad-it's-good " film . Although others try , nobody in the cast can best Clift's supremely awful performance ; her effort is astonishing . Also , watch Mitchell ( " High Chaparral " ) defeat Moll ( " Night Court " ) for best artificial hair . Bristol is delightfully devilish ; it's too bad he , Maurice Grandmaison ( as Papini ) , Klint Stevenson ( as Jim ) , and Christie Wagner ( as Ann ) have so few screen credits ; their characterizations are perfect . Films like this hardly ever have good endings ; admittedly , it's truly difficult to appropriately end a story as bad as this one - - but writer Philip Yordan and company come up with a real winner ; it may make you want to click your heels ? or hooves , as the case may be . See it with an open heart , or liver ?

Mr . Veidt receives an offer of exoneration from ruthless and powerful Raymond Massey ( as Cardinal Richelieu ) ; but , he must first capture Mr . Massey's enemy , a revolutionary Duke . Veidt manages to install himself as a guest in the Duke's castle , with its master away . While waiting for his prey to return , Veidt becomes smitten with the Duke's sister , Annabella ( as Lady Marguerite ) . Notable as Victor Sjöström final film as director ; and , the direction of " Under the Red Robe " is certainly a highlight . The performances of the three leads are also excellent , intensified by Mr . Sjöström , a master filmmaker . Unfortunately , this re-make of a 1923 swashbuckling silent doesn't offer very much action , which doesn't help its already slow-moving story . Romney Brent ( as Marius ) contrasts the intense lead performances , as Veidt's light-heeled lackey . Under the Red Robe ( / 37 ) Victor Sjöström - Conrad Veidt , Annabella , Raymond Massey
453706	15896852	327056	6.0	When Bad Things Happen to Bad People	Director Clint Eastwood's " Mystic River " is a well-performed , but ugly and disturbing film . When it opens , the characters who grow up to be Sean Penn ( as Jimmy Markum ) , Tim Robbins ( as Dave Boyle ) , and Kevin Bacon ( as Sean Devine ) are pre-teenage boys . Young " Dave " is abducted , after the three play hockey on a Massachusetts street . First of all , the actors playing young " Jimmy " ( Jason Kelly ) and " Sean " ( Connor Paolo ) seem to be reversed ; possibly , this is because Mr . Bacon's character's name is also Mr . Penn's first name ? Secondly , the confusing abduction is of a sexual nature ; later , when the story temporarily becomes an intriguing drama , this is clarified . By the third act , the film has fallen apart . Mystic River ( 2003 ) Clint Eastwood - Sean Penn , Tim Robbins , Kevin Bacon

He wishes to prevent his creation from any further murderous rampages by placing the brain of a good man inside the skull of the monster . The arrival of a woman and her terminally ill husband offer the doctor an opportunity to try his new theory , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Anton Diffring ( as Baron Von Frankenstein ) is an extremely enjoyable and effective leading man . If this is , indeed , the pilot for an unsold television series , it's difficult to understand how they were going to come up with the nearly 40 per season story ideas . As a short movie , writer / director Curt Siodmak does surprisingly well in this format , creating a " new " story to work within the existing " Frankenstein " mythos ; and , it's much better than the average 1958 half hour teleplay .

Before she can share her good fortune with her parents , she and two other girls are whisked away to begin their vacation of a lifetime . When one of the guests suddenly disappears , the young woman doesn't believe the explanation the old couple who run the inn gives her concerning the strange goings on at the Red Wolf , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Offering a delicious slice of low-budget horror cheese ; director Bud Townsend and writer Allen Actor , along with a wonderful cast , should absolutely exceed your expectations . There are some flaws , and unanswered questions - - like , what happened to Myrtle ? - - but , " Terror House " is too fun to pass up . Linda Gillen ( as Regina McKee ) plays a sweet , adorable lead character ; and , doesn't she have a great arrangement of The Beatles ' " White Album " photos on her dorm wall ? John Neilson ( as " Baby " John Smith ) is just as adorable , albeit touched ; love him licking his finger after going for the bottle of after dinner brandy . It's a wonder neither Ms . Gillen nor Mr . Neilson became better known ; they certainly had the hair to succeed through the 1980s . Players in tasty supporting roles include overeating Margaret Avery ( as Edwina ) , hortophile Arthur Space ( as Henry ) , and well-read Janet Wood ( as Pamela ) . But , the best of all may be marvelous " Grandma " Mary Jackson ( as Evelyn Smith ) ; her performance definitely is one to savor . Like Ms . Jackson says , " Don't be a party pooper ! " Mind your " Grandma " , and give yourself a big helping of " Terror House " . Terror House ( 1972 ) Bud Townsend - Linda Gillen , John Neilson , Mary Jackson
453280	15896852	58329	6.0	Take the Money and Run	Light-fingered Tippi Hedren ( as Marnie Edgar ) changes her hair color and gets secretarial jobs in order to steal from her employers . Dashing publisher Sean Connery ( as Mark Rutland ) is set to be Ms . Hedren's latest victim ; instead , he catches her red-handed . In order to stay out of the pokey , Mr . Connery insists Hedren be his wife . Then , he attempts to unravel the mystery of her : frigidity , fear of thunder , repulsion over the color red , and strange relationship with her mother ( memorably played by Louise Latham ) . Alfred Hitchcock's " Marnie " is not a bad movie ; it's just disappointing , after the director's string of classic predecessors . Many Hitchcock touches are evident ; and these , alone , make it an entertaining feature . Ms . Latham and the supporting players perform well , also . However , the leading co-stars never really make it very interesting ; and , the psychological combining of kleptomania and frigidity is a cold , loose fit .

453065	15896852	11909	6.0	Tempted by the Fruit of Another	Wallace Reid ( as Anatol Spencer ) is a wealthy newlywed who is oddly attracted to various women other than his wife - specifically : Wanda Hawley ( as Emilie ) , Agnes Ayres ( as Annie ) , and Bebe Daniels ( as Satan Synne ! ) . Gloria Swanson ( as Vivian ) is the wife who seems to develop a roving eye of her own as the running time progresses . BUT , are " The Affairs of Anatol " really affairs , or just a series of titillating temptations ? DeMille's work with mirrors is on display , with the director inserting a skeleton image of Mr . Reid in one scene . Reid was a very big star when this film was released ( one of the most popular actors in the world ) ; and , though this isn't really representative , it's nice to see him . Of the leading ladies , I enjoyed Ms . Ayres over the others , because her simple scenes with Monte Blue seem so ORDINARY when contrasted with the rest of the goings-on . DeMille's unlikely mix of titillation , religiosity , and heavy-handed message is obviously in full flower . While there are no performances for the ages , the scenes with Swanson being hypnotized by Theodore Kosloff are fun . Elliott Dexter ( as Max Runyon ) is the film's best supporting actor ; keep a sharp eye on his closing scenes as he'll reveal , through his performance , the affair you might not have been expecting ?

452699	15896852	55304	6.0	Steele Away	This retains much of the " House of Usher " glow , but is too repetitive ( of the earlier film ) , and loses story focus . It's really one short story - the ending , basically , stretched way out to feature film length . I didn't like the flashbacks - with the camera lens going down to brick size ( foreshadowy , though ) . They seemed only to pad the film , and didn't expand my knowledge of character motivation . I think the script was sloppily written , with the viewer left to explain away horrific plot holes , like : Who was buried in wife's tomb ? AND - Why oh why couldn't they let Barbara Steele scream " Let Me Out ! LET ME OUT ! " at the end ? Still , more fun than not .

453349	15896852	7610	6.0	Nugget Notch	Born and bred in the western United States , Joseph Girard ( as Judge Brand ) has never grown accustomed to life in the industrialized East . Mr . Girard reminisces , to young secretary Leo Pierson ( as Tom Reeves ) , about his life in the old West . In flashback , Girard loses his romantic interest to a pal , who is deserted , after two years , by the woman . Later , Girard moves to the East , to care for his ailing sister . In the present , Girard discovers the abandoned town of " Nugget Notch " ; he wants to rebuild and re-populate the town in the style of his fondly remembered West . Mr . Pierson is assigned the task . Pierson , who shares his older boss ' dream , finds a group of down-on-their-luck carnies outside San Diego : the " 49 Camp " . The ' 49-ers ' western theme is not popular with city folk ; and , they accept Pierson's invitation to Nugget Notch . So , Pierson joins the troupe as " Tom Robbins " ; his identity is a secret to everyone except leader William J . Dyer ( as J . Gordon Castle ) . As " Robbins " , Pierson falls for pretty Donna Drew ( as Peggy Bobbett ) . But , gentlemanly Jean Hersholt ( as Jim Raynor ) maneuvers to keep the romance from blooming ; he has knowledge about a dark secret from Ms . Drew's past . Distrusting Mr . Hersholt , Pierson writes boss Girard , who prepares his arrival ? All of the above happens within the first 25 minutes of " ' 49-'17 " ; indeed , it is a densely plotted movie . Don't miss a single title card , or you may be lost . The unusual title refers to the years 1849 and 1917 . The year 1849 refers to character Castle's troupe of " ' 49-ers " ; 1849 is the year noted as beginning the " California Gold Rush " , which also evokes the spirit of character Judge Brand's western memories . The year 1917 is , of course , the film's release year . The film would have been better off with a title like " Nugget Notch " . Ruth Ann Baldwin is more than serviceable , if less than spectacular , as both writer and director . ' 49-'17 ( 1917 ) Ruth Ann Baldwin - Joseph Girard , Leo Pierson , Jean Hersholt

At first , Mr . Newman is treated as a recovering war hero . After evidence surfaces to reveal he collaborated with the enemy , Wendell Corey ( as Major Sam Moulton ) serves Newman with court-martial papers . This doesn't sit well with military-minded father Walter Pidgeon ( as Colonel Edward W . Hall Sr . ) . Newman's widowed sister-in-law , Anne Francis ( as Aggie Hall ) is more understanding . A re-make of the Rod Serling's television version " The Rack " ( 1955 ) , with Mr . Corey reprising his thankless prosecutorial role ; this is a very well-acted , thought-provoking drama . It is also one of Newman's best early feature film performances . Smaller parts , like those essayed by Cloris Leachman ( as Caroline ) and James Best ( as Cassidy ) , provide an added incentive to watch . However , the ending , whatever the filmmakers ' intentions , is not very well-handled .

He's there with Charles Herbert ( as David Barker ) , a 7-year-old runaway who won't say where he belongs . Young Herbert told the policeman he had the blood sucked out of him by " Dr . Stone " at the hospital . Jeff ( Paul Peterson ) tries to bribe information from young Herbert , but he won't talk . Donna ( Donna Reed ) intuitively senses the boy needs some motherly attention , and persuades Alex they should keep him for Thanksgiving break . Jeff is recruited as " big brother " , but Herbert is incorrigible ? The guest performance , by scowling young Charles Herbert , is terrific . A busy young man before the camera ( at the time ) , Mr . Herbert later learned ( like Mr . Peterson ) that fame can sometimes be a cruel lover . The fact that the boy's mother not only divorced his father , but also deserted her son , makes this Thanksgiving-themed episode more thoughtful . And , it ends with an acceptance of single parenthood ; Donna helps repair the father / son relationship , without introducing daddy John Bryant ( as R . H . Barker ) to a potential new wife . So , writer John Whedon scores points for ducking the obvious . By the way , father Barker , who was a " Marlboro Man " , is allowed to smoke in the Stone home . And , the fish are real .

Tone , who shares his food and campfire with the younger man . Tone ministers , " We are all brothers under the sky . " In the morning , Tone fixes Duke's saddle . Duke leaves very impressed , and perhaps naively enthralled , with the charismatic preacher . Before re-joining the Wagon Train , Duke visits feisty old Irene Ryan ( as Martha Gresham ) ; and , he learns her boozing husband has drowned . When a sobered-up Wally Brown ( as George Gresham ) turns up alive , Duke learns the old couple were bilked out of $300 . 00 by Tone , who is revealed a fraud . Duke decides to find the unholy minister ; pretending to be a friend , he invites Tone to join the Wagon Train ? The resulting dramatics may be predictable ; but , they are deftly handled , by writer Ken Kolb and the Wagon train crew . Train master Chris Hale ( John McIntire ) takes a back seat , as the episode focuses on Mr . Miller's attractive " Duke " character . Miller performs well with veteran Tone , who performs marvelously as the bilking preacher . Tone explains , " I tell people what they want to hear . I revive their faith in miracles . " Ms . Ryan and Mr . Brown are noteworthy among the typically fine supporting players . After this appearance , Ryan began her successful episodic career as " Granny " on " The Beverly Hillbillies " . Conversely , Brown's career was over ; he died shortly before this episode aired . It must have been startling to see his character " come back from the dead " ; still , his appearance in " The Malachi Hobart Story " is served by a coincidently reverential tone . The script affirms the characters ' ( Christian ) faith . The Malachi Hobart Story ( / 62 ) David Butler - Franchot Tone , Denny Miller , John McIntire

Unfortunately , this means Mr . Wagner can't marry the two months pregnant Ms . Woodward - because her savvy father George Macready ( as Leo Kingship ) frowns on sex before marriage . Wagner realizes he will have to drop out of school , and support his disinherited love child , unless he can come up with another solution ? When Woodward gets up unscathed , after her fall on the bleachers , it's almost like you're watching a cartoon . She suffers nary a scratch , and is too stupid to ask why Wagner expressed so little concern . Still , it's fun to watch 25-year-old Wagner try to get away with it ; his is a cool , subliminal performance . And , just when you thought the film couldn't get any better looking , Jeffrey Hunter ( as Gordon Grant ) and Virginia Leith ( as Ellen Kingship ) enter the storyline . Director Gerd Oswald gets in some good Hitchcock-like licks ; and , Mary Astor ( as mother Corliss ) dresses up well .

All the beautiful photography seems wasted . The actors are also somewhat wasted ; though , they often appear to be doing the best they can .

Little Pricilla has experiences a similar growth spurt - from girl Elizabeth Taylor to woman June Lockhart ( who would re-encounter Lassie a decade later , as young Timmy's mother ) . Donald Crisp as father Sam has holds up well , considering . Meanwhile , in dog years , Lassie has a son , Laddie . Presumably , " Pal " plays Mama " Lassie " and Son " Laddie " - but , it's possible an actual " Son of Lassie " is used in the film . " Son of Lassie " is , understandably , not as good as the first Lassie film . The photography is absolutely beautiful , though ; and , Pal / Lassie's performance is excellent - in fact , one could argue that the dog creates two separate characterizations ( the Son a little less wise ) . Lawford in endearing as Joe . The World War II storyline is flawed , but inevitable , considering the time of release . The multiplication of Lassies was unnecessary , since it had been less than two years since the first Lassie . Still , it's a very well-photographed Lassie , with a rousing conclusion .

452433	15896852	11779	6.0	White Men Can't Jump	In a western cave , white William S . Hart ( as Black Deering ) , leader of the outlaw Raiders , feels the law crashing in on his gang's crime spree . Fellow bandit Joseph Singleton ( as Tom Jordan ) thinks Mr . Hart is chicken , and goads his rival and the gang into one more heist . Of course , as Hart feared , things go all wrong . Later , on the lam from both Jordan and the law , Hart hides out with lonely white Anna Q . Nilsson ( as Mary Brown ) . Ms . Nilsson is living alone with son Richard Headrick ( as " The Little Feller " ) , since the disappearance of her husband ? " The Toll Gate " delivers the expected Hart western elements ; however , they do not coalesce . It's a little unpleasant to start off with Hart disarmed by his gang's " mutiny " , but nice to see him tough it out . Watch for a pivotal scene wherein Hart opens Nilsson's Bible : in it , he reads the verse " By their fruits ye shall know them " and locates a photograph which reveals something important about the film . The " by their fruits " theme is completely illogical if you think about the photograph . Also , Hart's cabin revelation is rather foolishly timed ; obviously , it should have been made some minutes later ( relating it more to Singleton's threat ) .

453637	15896852	42994	6.0	Curtain Call	Without going into details , director Alfred Hitchcock's " Stage Fright " does something with a character's " point-of-view " that fatally flaws the film . By the last act , it will be obvious . It's surprising that so adept a director would " cheat " so ineffectively ; especially , when the technique can ( and has ) be done so well elsewhere . Possibly , Mr . Hitchcock is deliberately misleading the viewer , when he should be ambiguous . The picture is , otherwise , enjoyable . Wilkie Cooper's camera performs expertly . The cast , individually wonderful , never convincingly comes together . For example , it's difficult to believe Jane Wyman ( as Eve Gill ) is the daughter of Alistair Sim ( as Commodore Gill ) and Sybil Thorndike ( as Mrs . Gill ) . Still , Mr . Sim and Ms . Thorndike provide for a wealth of dry Hitchcock humor . Ms . Wyman and Marlene Dietrich ( as Charlotte Inwood ) are , of course , a treat ; and , they make the romantic entanglements as believable as possible . Leading men Richard Todd ( as Jonathan " Johnny " Cooper ) and Michael Wilding ( as Wilfred " Ordinary " Smith ) do their best opposite strong women and , especially in Mr . Todd's case , an unsure storyline . Kay Walsh ( as Nellie Goode ) leads the pack of smaller , delightful Hitchcock characters .

Then , as luck would have it , he wins a college scholarship . At Yale , Mr . Novarro becomes a football star ; but , he still faces class discrimination . Don't miss the opening sequence of this film ; it's a terrific introduction to the film , and defines Novarro's character : Novarro is seen in his " working class " job ; he gets into a fistfight , encounters a beautiful woman , and ends up under a pile of rubble . The woman with the irresistible legs is Madge Evans ( as Rosalie Stone ) ; she is both beautiful , and " upper class " . Novarro re-encounters her later in the film , along with Una Merkel ( as Thelma ) and Martha Sleeper ( as Barbara Winston ) . Novarro's nemesis is Ms . Evans ' brother Kane Richman ( as Tom Stone ) ; and , his roommates are John Arledge ( as Jim " Pidge " Pidgeon ) and Frank Albertson ( as Larry ) . Silent star Ralph Graves is a sound coach Malcolm Gale . Mr . Arledge , as Novarro's second roommate " Pidge " is the best supporting performer ( beating off some stiff competition ) . " I've lived with twelve fellas in my time and only liked three of them , " Arledge explains , after Novarro chases him around the dorm , trying to get some first aid down his pants . The film is a little too long for its own good ; and , it wavers too far from the main story of a poor working class youth winning a chance to attend college , and break class barriers . It's difficult to determine what Novarro is actually learning at Yale . He already knew how to fight , and doesn't seem to have accumulated too many career options - though , he is certainly better off with a Yale diploma . Novarro ( # 44 ) and the cast are certainly appealing , even when the story wavers . The end game plays well . Huddle ( 1932 ) Sam Wood - Ramon Novarro , John Arledge , Madge Evans
452939	15896852	234215	6.0	The Matrix Overloaded !	" The Matrix " ( 1999 ) is still a great stand-alone film . That first film is THE ONE to see . " The Matrix Reloaded " , the first of the inevitable sequels , sucks all the awesome special effects it can muster , and coats the screen with them . The underdeveloped storyline , which helped make the original more mysterious and imaginative , is filled in enough babble to expose it as significantly less than satisfactory . The creative balance of action , effects , and imagination is lost . The three main actors ( Reeves , Fishburne , and Moss ) are upstaged by " exciting new allies " . So , what's left ? - Although overwrought and onerous , the visual effects are STILL exciting , and the " Matrix Universe " isn't damaged beyond repair . Like they say , " To Be Concluded ?

453048	15896852	9976	6.0	A Baseball Hit for Charles Ray	Charles Ray ( as Benjamin " Ben " Harding ) is a country boy who loves baseball ; he's the pride of small town Brownsville . His sweetheart , Colleen Moore ( as Mazie Palmer ) , has a batting average of 1 , 000 in Mr . Ray's affection - however , he barely gets to first base ! John " Jack " Gilbert ( as Jim Blair ) is a rival for Ms . Moore's affections ; he is not only a heel , with a tendency to drink and gamble - Mr . Gilbert is also more well-heeled , being a banker's son . When St . Paul Pink Sox , a big league team , is stranded in Brownsville , Ray gets to strut his stuff ; then , he is offered a major league spot . Will success spoil Ben Harding ? Ray is convincing as " The Busher " , displaying the little mannerisms which made him so successful in this type of part . His face and body movements expertly portray the " innocent country boy " type . He says , " Gosh ! " . Entering a social , he pats his hair down with a licked hand . His performance at the " Box Social " is charming - at this occasion , the men " bid " on women they can only see as shadows behind a screen . Moore and Gilbert are fine in the supporting roles ; both would become major 1920s stars . The St . Paul Pink Sox ? It might have been a combination of the Boston Red and White Sox . Ray's curve ball nicely strikes out into one of the title cards , and that " Box Social " sure looked fun . It's difficult to believe a major league baseball team considers you finished after one bad game , though ; if that were true , there would be no baseball .

453235	15896852	34183	6.0	Tombstone Cowboy	Roy Rogers ( as Brett Starr ) gets out of Dodge , with some of his brother's family , to become " Sheriff of Tombstone " . Along the way , he meets old up with old pal George " Gabby " Hayes ( as Gabby ) , now a lawyer . Sally Payne returns as Gabby's daughter Queenie . Mr . Rogers and company find lawlessness in Tombstone , led by corrupt Mayor Addison Richards and wayward Sheriff Harry Woods . Jay Novello steals away with all acting honors as John Anderson aka Joe Martinez ; Mr . Novello is dialect-able , makes terrific getaways - and , he is more fun to watch than the cute kids , the granny , and the love interest for Rogers . Novello's versatility is very much appreciated in this film . By the way , the film closes with a suggestion Rogers is about to do some major neckin ' with Elyse Knox ( as Mary ) . Rogers and Ms . Payne share in a light , pleasant soundtrack , highlighted by Rogers ' " Sons of the Western Foil " and Payne's " Two-Gun Pete " .

452442	15896852	71589	6.0	Hot for Preacher	In order to elude authorities , western outlaw Marjoe Gortner ( as Ernie Parsons ) assumes the identity of a traveling preacher . Mr . Gortner takes up residence in parson-needy Castle Walk , Arizona ; there , at a funeral , he and sexy teenager Pamela Sue Martin ( as Sally Underwood ) are mutually attracted . Soon , Gortner's shady past threatens his budding relationship with young Ms . Martin . Sidekick Slim Pickens ( as Billy One-Eye ) and mother Estelle Parsons ( as Sadie Underwood ) lend their support . Even in this slightly above average television production , Gortner has star quality to burn . Taken as a screen test , " The Gun and the Pulpit " miraculously elevates the former evangelist to convincing western hero . Pamela Sue Martin is excellent as Gortner's barely legal leading lady ; her glances are more sensual than a strip tease . Director Daniel Petrie handles the assignment admirably . Gortner's star quality was evident since the riveting documentary " Marjoe " ( 1972 ) , which revealed his evangelical movement to be a money-grubbing scam . In hindsight , it seems Marjoe Gortner was too hot for Hollywood to handle .
453547	15896852	1207	6.0	Mack Sennett is Faithful	Arthur Johnson ( as Adonese ) is driving home after a date when he sideswipes simple-minded pedestrian Mack Sennett ( as Faithful ) . Mr . Johnson feels awful , and takes the shaken , but unwounded , tramp out shopping . Mr . Sennett is so taken with Johnson's generosity , he attaches himself to his handsome new friend . At first , Johnson feels guilty ; and , he lets Sennett hang around . Eventually , Johnson grows tired of having the adoring Sennett play Siamese twin , and throws the bum out . It doesn't last , however , as " Faithful " Sennett returns with a flower for his benefactor . Poor Johnson can't even spend time alone with his fiancée Florence Barker ; understandably , she doesn't want to share her beau with his new companion ? Sennett's comic pathos makes this a very effective film ; this time , he plays extraordinarily well with director D . W . Griffith , and his ideal leading man , Johnson . Sennett is especially sweet when he brings Johnson a flower ; he is too simple-minded to mind being roughed up by Johnson . Although he is annoying , Sennett's " Faithful " elicits much sympathy . This is also a very nicely paced film , with a pleasant balance of comedy , drama , and suspense . As a bonus , look for a generous amount of early Hollywood location footage ( around Biograph's Pico studio ) .
453155	15896852	27496	6.0	Go West , Young Man	In 1820 , handsome dance instructor Charles Collins ( as Jonathan Pride ) decides to visit his aunt in California . Young Mr . Collins thrills the ladies by waltzing with his hands touching their waists . Leaving his giddy pupils wanting more , Collins takes the long route - around the continent of South America . Armed with only his satchel and an umbrella ( to return to his aunt ) , Collins is mistaken for a pirate . As the " Dancing Pirate " , he is holds up in the western town of La Paloma . There , he dances , faces danger , and falls in love with lovely Senorita Steffi Duna ( as Serafina Perena ) , daughter of the town's bumbling mayor , Frank Morgan ( as Don Emilio Perena ) . The well-staged " Finale " earned an " Academy Award " nomination for dance director Russell Lewis . Leading man Collins looks like he had everything needed to become a major star - possibly , he found himself in the wrong studio , at the wrong time . Without the takes afforded the standard era star ( Fred Astaire ) , he manages to be dazzling , in his solo routines . The scene with Collins ' umbrella stuffed down the front of his pants provides a visual worthy of a Mae West double-entendre . Mr . Morgan isn't a very convincing " Don " , but he is always a film asset . Ms . Duna , a Hungarian woman , is a beautiful and believable Senorita . Currently , this film is more available in " black & white " than " color " - this is not always a disadvantage , but " Dancing Pirate " really should be seen in color . Although my " Hollywood Legends " VHS Madacy HWGL-5512 says " B & W " on the sleeve , this release of film IS definitely " in color " . It most certainly does NOT star cover-girl Rita Hayworth , however . Ms . Hayworth , Pat Nixon , and Marjorie Reynolds can be spotted among the dancing extras ( provided you know who you are looking for well enough to spot them ) .

Gossipy reporter Erich von Stroheim ( as Adam Buzzard ) causes everyone problems for everyone , by revealing their secrets in his newspaper society column . Real-life couple John Emerson and Anita Loos are notable contributors . While the situation is ludicrous ; Talmadge's comic performance , von Stroheim's snooty support , and the New York locale are strengths .

Meanwhile , paranoiac Phillippe begins to feel something may be rotten in Robbins ' computer empire ? Director Peter Howitt leads his cast and crew through a neat , suspenseful thriller . Sometimes , " AntiTrust " comes on a little too pretty ; but , it's an all-around good effort . And , it definitely captures that sinking feeling you have when switching from a school-centered to a work-based lifestyle . Robbins ' character isn't hard to figure out , but he plays it deliciously . Ms . Forlani is truly fascinating ; " Does that make me Yoko ? " she asks . Mr . Howitt has a terrific cameo . Three geek " shout-outs ! " for Howitt , John Bailey , and Zach Staenberg . AntiTrust ( 2001 ) Peter Howitt - Ryan Phillippe , Tim Robbins , Claire Forlani
453253	15896852	408306	6.0	An Eye for Poetic Violence	Described as , " Inspired by real events , ' Munich ' reveals the intense story of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians believed to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of 11 Israeli athletes - and the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it , " on the DVD sleeve , " Steven Spielberg's explosive suspense thriller garnered five Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture and Best Director . " " Munich " is an undeniably well-produced film ; Mr . Spielberg's films generally are . After Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir explains , " The world must see that killing Jews will be from now on an expensive proposition . , " handsome Eric Bana ( as Avner Kaufman ) leads Israel's covert team , assigned to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre at Munich . Mr . Bana gives the film a strong , focused characterization . He gets four helpers : pre-Bond blond Daniel Craig ( as Steve ) , bomb-maker Mathieu Kassovitz ( as Robert ) , veteran forger Hanns Zischler ( as Hans ) , and bespectacled diplomat Ciarán Hinds ( as Carl ) . The team of five tracks terrorists around the world . When one is found , the film's excitement is heightened considerably . Informant Mathieu Amalric ( as Louis ) adds some intrigue , also . The film is slow , and the violence intermittent - but when it occurs , you practically have to scrape the flesh off your screen with a squeegee . There is an attempt to be " fair " and / or " straightforward " in that the film gives an " historically fictionalized " account of a factual event . But , there is a political point being made - the film clearly questions both the righteousness and effectiveness of Israel's decision .

452870	15896852	443632	6.0	Michael Douglas Gets Some Secret Service	Secret Service veteran Michael Douglas ( as Pete Garrison ) once helped save President Ronald Reagan's life , during a 1981 assassination attempt . Presently , Mr . Douglas is one of the most trusted and respected agents assigned to protect the President . But , Douglas is having an affair with the President's wife , Kim Basinger ( as Sarah Ballentine ) . Getting it on with the " First Lady " results in deception showing up in a company-wide lie detector test Douglas has to take , after the Secret Service discovers a " mole " within the organization . Framed , Douglas flees top investigator Kiefer Sutherland ( as David Breckinridge ) and rookie hottie Eva Longoria ( as Jill Marin ) , while the real killers move to kill the President ? The questions Douglas is asked , during his lie detector test , should have tipped him off ; they are phrased differently than those given to the other agents . There are a lot of moments when the plot falters , but director Clark Johnson and the cast keep convincing you to ? move along . . . Mr . Johnson does an excellent job - and , he steps in front of the camera very effectively , as early victim " Charlie Merriweather " . It was nice to see Martin Donovan and Blair Brown in the supporting cast , reunited after working together on " Dark Shadows " . The cast , direction , and D . C . locations , keep " The Sentinel " above average . The Sentinel ( 2006 ) Clark Johnson - Michael Douglas , Kiefer Sutherland , Kim Basinger
452425	15896852	1499	6.0	Griffith Draws the Battle Lines	Sweethearts Charles West and Blanche Sweet have fun at an 1861 dance ; then , he and the other men , including Robert Harron , are off to fight for the Union , in the Civil War . Women and children cheer the departing throng - - but they don't get far , as the war rages just outside town . In the first conflict , Mr . West becomes panic-stricken , and goes AWOL . He runs home to Ms . Sweet , scared witless . Sweet is somewhat crazed , herself , and practically throws him out ; obviously , she is ashamed of her boyfriend . Luckily , he manages to gather his wits , and return to the front before he is missed . He goes just before being discovered by wounded Union Commander Charles H . Mailes , who arrives at Sweet's home to recuperate . On the battlefield , West gets a chance to prove himself , after a tragic event ? Though less than twenty minutes long , this is an " epic " film . The cast of extras is very large ; memorably , many of them march by ( presumably ) G . W . Bitzer's camera as they go off to war . Cheering crowds , and warring soldiers , are all over the screen . " The Battle " is one of the better early films directed by D . W . Griffith . The battle sequences are excitingly staged ; and a stagecoach ride thrills . The story of cowardice during wartime is bold ; Griffith had just explored the theme with " The House with Closed Shutters " ( 1910 ; but , in that instance , Walthall's " cowardly " character had been drinking heavily ; West's character is truly stricken by fear . Charles Ray would play a similar coward in 1915 . West and Sweet get a chance to emote ? and , over-emote . The total lack of understanding Sweet shows West is a little hard to understand ; it looks like she may have been playing a little " mad " herself . Probably , Griffith was directing the two to express some extra craziness for entertainment value . Harron is at his usual best . Familiar faces include Donald Crisp as the Union soldier first in line , to the left , when West joins up ; and , look for Lionel Barrymore steering the stagecoach just after Harron expires on the battlefield .
452641	15896852	3436	6.0	One Good Turn Deserves Another	Mae Marsh works , happily , as an ordinary telephone operator ; among the calls she places is one to the jewelry shop " Julius Jorgenson " , as wealthy Claire McDowell calls to arrange a meeting about some jewels . Ms . Marsh uses her break time to see policeman suitor Alfred Paget . " The Telephone Girl and the Lady " cross paths as the former is on her way back to work , and the latter is returning home from the jewelry store . McDowell is impressed with Marsh's friendliness . They do not know Ms . McDowell is being followed by bicycle thief Harry Carey ; he is planning to relieve McDowell of her jewels . Later , " The Lady " McDowell sends " The Telephone Girl " Marsh a beautiful necklace , writing , in an accompanying note , " I am asking you to accept this token in appreciation of your promptness and painstaking efforts to please . " From her telephone operator position , Marsh calls to thank McDowell for the gift . While the two women converse , burglar Carey sneaks enters McDowell's house , placing " The Lady " in great danger ! Marsh hears McDowell being assaulted at the other end of her telephone line - - will she be able to rescue McDowell from Carey's clutches ? D . W . Griffith , G . W . Bitzer and the good folks at Biograph deliver another winner . The location scenes are beautiful ; generous amounts of early 1900s New York scenery are displayed on screen . The Biograph players perform an exciting story well . Carey is particularly menacing in his scene with McDowell ; adding an amorous edge to his attack . Marsh is also notable ; she is both expressive and natural , in a thoroughly charming performance . The story is a little confusing , however ; it is adapted from a play , where some further explanation of story elements and character motivations may be clearer .
452861	15896852	22685	6.0	A Sound Stage for the Stars	A Bill of Divorcement ( 1932 ) George Cukor - John Barrymore , Billie Burke , Katharine Hepburn It's Christmas in England . World War I veteran John Barrymore ( as Hilary Fairfield ) has been committed to an asylum for 15 years , due to insanity brought on by " shell shock " . The season has resulted in a blessing for Mr . Barrymore , who is on his way home for the holidays , after recovering his sanity . Meanwhile , wife Billie Burke ( as Margaret " Meg " Fairfield ) has fallen in love again , received a divorce , and is planning to re-marry . Barrymore's return throws the household into turmoil . Daughter Katharine Hepburn ( as Sidney Fairfield ) , also planning to marry , begins to fear starting her own family , after learning Barrymore's madness is hereditary . It's admittedly not intended as such , and consequently not exceptional ; but , George Cukor's " A Bill of Divorcement " should be seen as a filmed stage play . The story is thought-provoking ; it mixes madness , marriage , and war with duty , self-sacrifice , and religion . The characterizations are , today , " outdated " in style , substance , and storyline . Still , they are interesting in context . The three lead performances are significant : Barrymore's theatrical skills are clearly evident ; his performance is most enjoyable ( the war duty scene is a highlight ) . Additionally , Ms . Burke begins a welcome " second career " in sound films ; and Ms . Hepburn begins a welcome " second career " in films . With less to do , steadfast supporting actress Elizabeth Patterson ( as Hester Fairfield ) definitely holds her own .
452551	15896852	86589	6.0	All Punks Go to Heaven	In Penelope Spheeris's " Suburbia " , alienated and unwanted teenagers ( and twentysomethings ) find a new home for themselves : the " T . R . House " by " The 605 " . T . R . stands for " The Rejected " , and Interstate 605 is a freeway located in San Gabriel , California . " Suburbia " is explained in the film , perhaps incorrectly , as a combining of the words " Suburb " and " Utopia " . Leader of the T . R . s is Chris Pedersen ( as Jack Diddley ) ; he is the one with the super blond surfer ' do . He rounds-up two rejected teenagers as the film opens ? BUT , first things first . Director-writer Spheeris begins the film with a " dog attack " ; interestingly , the film will feature a group of Wild Dogs , which threaten the inhabitants of " Suburbia " . The parallel / symbolism between the T . R . s and the abandoned dogs should be obvious . Then , we seen Bill Coyne ( as Evan Mark Johnson ) at home , reading a comic book , with the T . V . playing ; his mother comes home and berates him for stealing her liquor , and neglecting his chores . Mr . Coyne decides to runaway from home , saying goodbye to little brother Andrew Pece ( as Ethan Johnson ) ; after their mother has a drunken automobile smash-up , Mr . Pace will join his big brother at T . R . House . T . R . leader Pederson finds Coyne after a punk rock concert , " passed out " ; his drink spiked , incidentally , by the film's " druggie " Keef ( Grant Miner ) , who is also a member of T . R . They go pick up Wade Walston ( as Joe ) , who lives with his disinterested gay father . Mr . Walston provide the film's " romance " when he hooks up with suicidal Jennifer Clay ( as Sheila ) . Timothy O'Brien ( as Skinner ) is another important member of T . R . house ; he hammers nails in walls , so the inhabitants can hang . Flea ( as Razzle ) is the most illustrious member of the T . R . s ; also known as Michael Balzary , he is the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' bassist . Ironically , this Flea is good for dogs ; and , he attempts to tame the wild ones threatening " Suburbia " . Flea also demonstrates a fondness for rats ; so , perhaps , he was a fan of the 1970s punk band The Stranglers ' IV Rattus Norvegicus ? The punk music groups represent the era well ; but , the soundtrack could have been improved by more classic punk songs ; and , a title song would have been great . The T . R . s should be commended for not watching Wally George " Hot Seat " , but they still , however , have awful taste in T . V . shows . Their set should have been traded in for a good stereo . The acting is realistic , and the characters speak Spheeris well ; but , the relatively small amount of sex and drugs doesn't ring true . The End is a downer .

They are : Richard Long and Polly Bergen ( as Jerry and Sylvia Carter ) , Edward Albert and Kate Jackson ( as Jimmy and Mary Frances Radney ) , and Tom Bosley and Celeste Holm ( as David and Elizabeth Mason ) . On ship , they discover why nobody can really remember entering the contest ; it's a scam . A mysterious group known as " E & M Productions " has lured the six " winners " on board to kill them . As the travelers meet unfortunate ends , Michael Constantine ( as Dr . Burke ) assumes the role of investigator . Cesare Danova is the ship's captain . All are delightful . This is an unexpectedly suspenseful Spelling-Goldberg television production , with excellent performances and direction ( Ralph Senensky ) . And , it's very well paced . As they are being killed off , the three " happy " couples are revealed to be in significantly troubled marriages ; this , and a resemblance to ABC-TV's later " The Love Boat " series , gives the movie a heightened eeriness . Jack B . Sowards ' script has a few surprises ; and , most of the time , it is challenging to guess which passenger to will die next . Unfortunately , part of an ending explanation does not match a prior character motivation ; it's not enough to spoil the movie , however . This was Richard Long's last role , sadly ; the former " Big Valley " star died of a heart attack late in 1974 . Also , around this time , beautiful young co-stars Kate Jackson and Edward Albert were a real life couple ; although , they were " living in sin " ( unmarried ) .

Parties and roadhouse jaunts are the college girls ' preoccupation . On the train trip to " Winston " , Ms . Bow recalls accidentally climbing into bed with fellow traveler Fredric March ( as James " Gil " Gilmore ) . As it turns out , Mr . March is the school's new Professor of Anthropology . Bow and her housemates see the good-looking teacher arrive , and immediately become interested in anthropological matters . Eventually , Bow and March fall into each other's arms , which threatens their student and teacher status at the college . Bow's first " talkie " was not unsuccessful , although it is sometimes recalled as a failure . Perhaps , detractors are recalling Bow's subsequent talking features . Strangely , she became more unnatural , hesitant , and uneven in later films . Possibly , she was rattled by negative reviews . However , by 1931 , Bow's performances became more assured . By then , unfortunately , it was too late for the huge audiences attending " The Wild Party " to appreciate her efforts . " The Wild Party " is a more than respectable talking film debut ; while undeniably silly , it was a fun " college youth " film . Bow wasn't going to be young forever , obviously ; but , she could still carry out the college hi-jinks . March and the supporting cast perform well . And , Paramount assigned a woman , Dorothy Arzner , to direct the film . Watch for one notably silent word " mouthed " the film .

Griffith is accepted for an audition in Budapest . She finds figures more interested in her beauty than her singing ability . Mannish Maude George ( as Madame Bauer ) demands Griffith , " Show me your legs " , then hires her to sing at the " Palais de Paris " . There , leering patrons , like Lowell Sherman ( as Henri D'Avril ) , admire the female form . Griffith bonds with matronly worker Louise Dresser ( as Rosa de Garcer ) , a down-on-her-luck Baroness . When Ms . Dresser's pension check comes in , she takes Griffith on a Cinderella-like adventure ; and , she meets princely Charles Ray ( as Richard Dupont ) . Lewis Milestone ( director ) , John Arnold ( photographer ) , and William Cameron Menzies ( designer ) are responsible for some stunning , stylish work . Especially , savor Griffith's arrival at the squalid " Palais de Paris " , early in the film . Later , watch for the scene with Griffith and Mr . Ray sitting at the grand piano , as the raised lid puts them in a beautiful , reflective " triangle " . Star Griffith receives a lavish , loving production . The cast is very entertaining , especially Dresser and Ms . George , who more often supported Erich von Stroheim . Ray seems a little uncomfortable at times ; a decade earlier , he routinely offered superior performances . Although , the story is rather routine , it's nice to have " The Garden of Eden " around ; thanks to " Flicker Alley " .

453442	15896852	27521	6.0	The Unholy Dolls	Wrongly imprisoned Lionel Barrymore ( as Paul Lavond ; and , later , Mme . Mandelip ) escapes from Devil's Island , after a seventeen years . Accompanying him to freedom is mad scientist Henry B . Walthall ( as Marcel ) . The pair hook up with Marcel's wife Malita ( Rafaela Ottiano ) , and form an unholy trio . Mr . Barrymore wants to get even with three ex-partners , who framed him for their crimes . Mr . Walthall wants to continue his grotesque experiments ; he has discovered a way to shrink human beings into doll-sized slaves . After Walthall expires , Barrymore uses the scientist's doll slaves to enact his revenge , with a little help from widow Ottiano . While attractive , the duo of Maureen O'Sullivan ( as Lorraine ) and Frank Lawton ( as Toto ) are no match for the more seasoned actors . It's a treat to see old D . W . Griffith players Barrymore and Walthall team-up ; and , then join Ottiano , at her most outrageous . Director Tod Browning delivers a slew of additional entertaining performers ; among them , Pedro de Cordoba is chiefly villainous . Sadly , Walthall expires way too soon ! Barrymore was evidently being considered as MGM and Browning's chief replacement for the deceased Lon Chaney . " The Devil-Doll " is a highly derivative film , from the always fascinating Browning . The Browning / Barrymore team had just completed the Browning / Chaney re-make " Mark of the Vampire " , which was not entirely successful . Here , Barrymore is much better ; though , his performance is very evocative of Chaney in " The Unholy Three " - - note the scene with jewels hidden inside a child's toy appears , to better effect , in both " The Unholy Three " ( 1925 ) and " The Unholy Three " ( 1930 ) ; though , it remains a highlight . The penultimate ending sequences are also exciting , while the reason for continuing the father / daughter deception seems strained .
452533	15896852	164052	6.0	Out of Sight , Out of Mind	Adventurous Kevin Bacon ( as Sebastian Caine ) heads up an ultra-secret group of scientists , employed by the US Pentagon ; they have discovered how to turn animals invisible . The group includes Mr . Bacon's beautiful ex-girlfriend Elisabeth Shue ( as Linda McKay ) , and her handsome new bed partner Josh Brolin ( as Matt Kensington ) . After successfully making a gorilla ( " Isabelle " ) invisible , and bringing her back to the " seen " world , Bacon decides it's time for a human to take the invisibility plunge . Bacon swallows the serum , and becomes an invisible man . . . " What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen ? " asks Kim Dickens ( as Sarah Kennedy ) . Good idea . An updated , darker " Invisible Man " - with Kevin Bacon as the title character , and fantastic special effects - is ruined by a truly absurd storyline . The side effects of Twinkies are astonishing . And , you won't believe the healing powers of Duct Tape . For what it's worth , the scenes with Greg Grunberg ( as Carter Abbey ) show the subject of voyeurism handled well . As usual , Bacon is game . Finally , Rhona Mitra is an eyeful , as Bacon's busty neighbor . Hollow Man ( 2000 ) Paul Verhoeven - Kevin Bacon , Elisabeth Shue , Josh Brolin
453078	15896852	22725	6.0	Killing Me Softly with His Song	Armistice Day 1919 is celebrated by most French citizens , but handsome veteran Phillips Holmes ( as Paul Renaud ) is haunted by the face of a German soldier he killed during the Great War . After consulting with a Priest , Mr . Holmes decides to visit the man's family , in Germany . Holmes intends to confess his act , and clear his Christian conscience . But , the dead soldier's family mistake Holmes for friend of the deceased , after learning he's been bringing flowers to Mr . Holderlin's grave . Eventually , the dead man's father , Lionel Barrymore ( as Dr . Holderlin ) , accepts Holmes as almost a replacement son . Then , Holmes falls in love with pretty Nancy Carroll ( as Elsa ) , the fiancée of the man he killed ? Ms . Carroll and Holmes were more memorable in " The Devil's Holiday " ( 1930 ) ; and , Carroll was runner-up in the " Academy Award " for " Best Actress " for the 1929-30 eligibility period . But , here , Carroll doesn't have anywhere near the screen time or script she needed to make a like impression . The more focal relationship is between " son " Holmes and " father " Barrymore . Holmes is the lead actor ; and , with direction from Ernst Lubitsch , performs in a manner that sometimes seems over-the-top , but was favored by many " serious " actors during the early 1930s . Still , Mr . Lubitsch contributes memorable moments , and the opening montage is terrific . The film's thesis is out of fashion is some ways , but is nevertheless interesting .

452754	15896852	2199	7.0	Crossing the Water	In Palestine , a virgin named Mary ( Gene Gauntier ) is visited by one of God's angels ; subsequently , she becomes pregnant . Meanwhile , an angel of God invites Joseph , a son of David , to wed Mary . The angel explains that Mary's child is the savior Jesus Christ , who will grow up to save his people from their sins . The child grows up without fanfare ; but , as an adult ( Robert Henderson-Bland ) , Christ assembles disciples , and begins performing miracles . He is persecuted for his beliefs ; and , finally , he is crucified . For its time , a very good version of the often told story of Jesus Christ . Director Sidney Olcott and photographer George Hollister do very well ; their scenes with Mary , Joseph , and young Jesus in Egypt are a beautiful example . It's nice to see the scenes with Jesus as a child ; and , note the one where he carries a stick of lumber foreshadows the crucifixion . Mr . Henderson-Bland acts the part very well ; he is subdued , and looks comfortable in the role . Ms . Gauntier , who assisted Mr . Olcott greatly throughout the production , was certainly the film's most valuable player . The miracles scenes are very silly looking , and acted ; although , to be honest , I haven't seen enough people " raised from the dead " to judge the antics on screen . The " walking on water " might have worked if the water was a little calmer . There should have been more story explanation given for it , but the crucifixion elicited passion . Not the first " feature " film , but an important one ; for its lovely Egypt , Palestine , and Ireland location scenes . " From the Manger to the Cross " is the peak production from the early " Kalem " film company . Notably , it omits the resurrection ( some versions add it , from another film ) . From the Manger to the Cross ( / 12 ) Sidney Olcott - Robert Henderson-Bland , Gene Gauntier , Robert G . Vignola
452547	15896852	28203	7.0	Parents Just Don't Understand	Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard play Shakespeare's star-crossed young lovers Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague . As this version of " Romeo and Juliet " is a relatively faithful adaptation of Shakespeare's original play , the ages of the characters are relevant ; thus , Ms . Shearer , Mr . Howard , and others are , obviously , too old for the parts . That being said , this is still somewhat entertaining film , well directed by George Cukor , and expertly photographed by William Daniels . The production , sets , and lighting are extraordinary . Shearer is especially well lighted ; and , she performs Juliet in earnest . John Barrymore ( as Mercutio ) and Basil Rathbone ( as Tybalt ) are more fun than a barrel of Montagues ; hey , you live by the sword , die by the sword .
452732	15896852	33076	7.0	Carrying a Torch for Joan Bennett	Some surprisingly glorious scenery and set direction highlight " The Count of Monte Cristo " . Louis Hayward cuts a fine Count ( aka " The Torch " ) . Joan Bennett is the beautiful queen - attracting the attentions of both Mr . Hayward and a deliciously wicked George Sanders . They , and the supporting players work very well together , and keep the movie interesting . My favorite of the many nicely envisioned scenes is when Ms . Bennett , in a garden prison , releases a bird from its cage . Cleverly symbolic . I also like the " graveyard " hiding place - decorated with skeletons . The film's ending is terrific . With a tightening of its script and a little more budget , this might have attained classic status . It's a great example of a cast and crew making the absolute most of what they were given by a studio . The Son of Monte Cristo ( 1941 ) Rowland V . Lee - Louis Hayward , Joan Bennett , George Sanders
453352	15896852	39041	7.0	Thinly Disguised	Sharp , well-produced variation on the frequently filmed " Enoch Arden " plot . Herein , Claudette Colbert ( as Elizabeth MacDonald ) is informed that husband Orson Welles ( as John Andrew MacDonald ) is a Great War causality . Ms . Colbert is devastated , and pregnant with his son , who grows up to be Richard Long ( as John " Drew " Andrew ) . Colbert marries comforting boss George Brent ( as Lawrence " Larry " Hamilton ) ; and , they have a happy life . But , first husband Welles really didn't die - - he was only badly wounded . After two decades , Welles goes home - - but , he has a surgically altered face , and walks with a limp . Directed by Irving Pichel , Colbert and Welles are great fun to watch ; with their fine performances , you can read some ambiguity into the film's ultimately flawed storyline ( which has to do with recognition ) . Mr . Long is quite impressive , in his film debut ; he had a long , successful , and far too under-appreciated television career . Eight-year-old Natalie Wood is cute as Welles ' foster daughter " Margaret " . If only it were more plausible . . .
453273	15896852	13085	7.0	Elmer Clifton's Fantastic Voyage	" They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ; these see the works of the Lord ; and his wonders in the deep . " - - Psalm 107 In the whaling town of New Bedford , Massachusetts , pretty Marguerite Courtot ( as Patience Morgan ) plays with her dolls ; an adult , she longs for her girlhood days with " the boy next door " . Happily , her objectification , Raymond McKee ( as Thomas Allan Dexter ) , returns , after some years in college . Soon , Mr . McKee opens a mill , and begins to court Ms . Courtot . McKee asks her father William Walcott ( as William Morgan ) for Courtot's hand in marriage . But Walcott , a strict Quaker , won't allow his obedient daughter to marry outside her religion . McKee offers to convert , but finds another challenge almost insurmountable : " Patience is a whaleman's daughter , " Walcott explains , " Unless thee has thrown a harpoon into a whale , take thy story of love elsewhere . It can never be - - never ! " So , McKee goes directly to the next whaling ship , hoping to harpoon a whale ; instead , he is abducted , and put to work aboard . Mixing it up in the waling ship is mischievous stowaway Clara Bow ( as Dot Morgan ) , Walcott's grand-daughter ; she has an eye for cabin boy James Turfler ( as Jimmy ) . Meanwhile , Patrick Hartigan ( as Jake Finner ) and Jack Baston ( as Samuel Siggs ) are plotting to steal both Walcott's ship , and his daughter's virtue ? The main story , and performances of the principals are thoroughly unconvincing ; although McKee does well whaling , while Courtot , the film's feminine lead , sits at home playing with her dolls . There are disturbing religious and racial undertones in the plotting . Ms . Bow , in her second film , and Mr . Turfler easily steal the attention . The Elmer Clifton direction , and photography by A . G . Penrod with Paul H . Allen are outstanding , however ; and , their seafaring scenes are thrilling .
453187	15896852	23814	7.0	The Title is a Dead Giveaway	Barbara Stanwyck ( as Megan Davis ) arrives in Shanghai , to marry missionary Gavin Gordon ( as Bob Strike ) . Instead , she falls in love with a sexy Chinese warlord , Nils Asther ( as General Yen ) , who is winds up holding her prisoner . Frank Capra's " The Bitter Tea of General Yen " isn't as offensive as it appears , on the surface ; although , the story is , ultimately , unsatisfactory . Still , it's a fine looking production , with beautiful direction and photography ( Joseph Walker ) . Ms . Stanwyck and Mr . Asther perform their sexual attraction marvelously ; their characterizations are worthy of " Best Actress " and " Best Actor " consideration . And , supporting actress Toshia Mori ( as Mah-Li ) makes it a passionate threesome - when the three of them share a scene , on Asther's train , every movement sizzles . The Bitter Tea of General Yen ( 1933 ) Frank Capra - Barbara Stanwyck , Nils Asther , Walter Connolly
453342	15896852	15289	7.0	William Powell Marries the Gish Sisters	In Florence , Italy , during the Renaissance , Lillian Gish ( as Romola ) lives with her blind father Bonaventura Ibáñez ( as Bardo Bardi ) , who is a friend of Savonarola , Michelangelo , and Leonardo da Vinci . Although they are not too wealthy , the Bardis have one of the world's best libraries . Young sculptor Ronald Colman ( as Carlo Bucellini ) is interested in the lovely Lillian , but she is interested in more scholarly pursuits ; this makes her an easy mark for shipwrecked sham scholar William Powell ( as Tito Melema ) . Before Mr . Powell cleans up for his meeting with Lillian , he meets simple street maid Dorothy Gish ( as Tessa ) . Dorothy is quite taken with the dashing Powell ; then , so is Lillian . Can he marry them both ? Henry King's " Romola " makes a fine silent film , thanks to lavish location production values , and a winning cast . The title notwithstanding , the film focuses on the intermarrying three characters played by Lillian Gish , William Powell , and Dorothy Gish . Close to the film's end , the three have some great on screen conflict time together ; and , Lillian performs a cathartic moment exceptionally well . An exciting ending follows . Curiously , Powell's " Tito " character seems to be the story's main protagonist , arguably , until the end ; surely , the original George Eliot novel was more focused on " Romola " .
453570	15896852	561192	7.0	Smoke from a Distant Fire	After helplessly witnessing his father's death , in a fiery car accident , 14-year-old California boy Ronny Howard ( as Chris Long ) goes into shock . Overcoming some grief , young Howard must adjust to life with a new stepfather , Earl Holliman ( as Cal Fitch ) . Although Mr . Holliman tries to be fatherly , he only opens old wounds . Howard wants his real father . That is not possible , but could Howard have a dog ? Mr . Holliman turns his stepson's request down , as a dog's presence would disrupt Holliman sheep ranching business . When Howard finds a " wild dog " , wounded in the woods , he is defiantly determined to keep the animal . This puts young Howard at odds with his stepfather ? " Smoke " is a great story ; it's one of those symbolic animal tales Disneyland favors , and can do well . This one surely benefits from William Corbin's original book ( adapted by John Furia Jr . ) - the young man's transference of love to , and identification with , the wounded animal is nicely done . But , the story's more subtle symbolism ( like the " fox in the hen-house " ) is even better . Howard and Holliman are outstanding , as the disconnected son and stepfather . Of course , Howard uses his acting education from years of appearing in Andy Griffith's " Mayberry " ; still , this is a strong , individual characterization . With Jacqueline Scott , Pamelyn Ferdin , and Andy Devine in the cast , " Smoke " is cute and irresistible . Smoke , pt 1 ( / 70 ) Vincent McEveety - Ron Howard , Earl Holliman , Jacqueline Scott
453565	15896852	561193	7.0	Smoke Gets in Your Eyes	After helplessly witnessing his father's death , in a fiery car accident , 14-year-old California boy Ronny Howard ( as Chris Long ) went into shock . Overcoming some grief , young Howard had to adjust to life with a new stepfather , Earl Holliman ( as Cal Fitch ) . Although Mr . Holliman tried to be fatherly , he only opened old wounds . Howard wants his real father , which is not possible . Mr . Holliman turned down his stepson's request for a dog - but , in part one ( last week ) Howard found his dog " Smoke " . He is defiantly determined to keep the animal , but the real owner has other plans ? " Smoke " is a great story ; it's one of those symbolic animal tales the Disney studio favored , and often did so well . This one surely benefits from William Corbin's original book ( adapted by John Furia Jr . ) - the young man's transference of love to , and identification with , the wounded animal is nicely done . But , the story's more subtle symbolism ( like the " fox in the hen-house " ) is even better . The climatic , heavy-handed " rescue from fire " isn't as satisfying ; but , this is mainly due to TV budget restraints . " Smoke " could have stood up as a first class feature presentation . Howard and Holliman do well , as the disconnected son and stepfather . Of course , Howard , uses his acting education , from years of appearing in Andy Griffith's " Mayberry " ; still , this is a strong , individual characterization - and , it shows Howard to be very capable between his two long-running typecasts ( " Opie " and Richie " ) . Jacqueline Scott ( as Fran Long Fitch ) makes the most of the more minor mother / wife role , lifting the picture with a couple of very strongly performed dramatic scenes . With Pamelyn Ferdin and Andy Devine in the cast , " Smoke " is cute and irresistible . Smoke , pt 2 ( / 70 ) Vincent McEveety - Ron Howard , Earl Holliman , Jacqueline Scott
452640	15896852	2054	7.0	Mary Pickford and the Beast	Mary Pickford is quite taken with Edwin August ; in fact , he is her " ideal " . But , Mr . August's refusal to get mixed up in a street brawl makes him look like a coward to Ms . Pickford . Meanwhile , convict Alfred Paget has escaped from prison ; and , he is " A Beast at Bay " . While Pickford and August go for a ride in her nifty 1900s automobile , criminal Paget ambushes one of his guards , taking the man's clothing and gun . Next , Pickford drops off August , still arguing he is a coward , and drives off . Alone , Pickford gets out of her car to retrieve a fallen garment ; then , on-the-lam Paget moves in to carjack her . From a distance , August witnesses Pickford being taken at gunpoint - - can he save his girl , and prove he's not a coward ? Another D . W . Griffith film with a criminal invading an otherwise unrelated situation ; this time , the interest is heightened as August's cowardice does play well against the danger offered by convict Paget . August seems , possibly , a little more reasonable than cowardly , given the circumstance depicted ; however , the characterizations are interesting and believable . The " parallel " stories have a structural reason to juxtapose . The engine pursuit is genuinely thrilling - - Griffith and his crew continue to offer great , innovative movie excitement . Mae Marsh is the best of the always fine Biograph supporting troupe ; she's Pickford's best girlfriend . Pickford is fine as the demanding damsel ; she plays the heroine with a relatively high level of resourcefulness - - and , it's nice to see Mary Pickford in the " driver's seat " ! Paget steals some acting honors , with his portrayal of the desperate convict . Look for a great scene between Paget and Pickford - - at about 11 : 00 minutes in - - Paget will touch Mary Pickford's curls , finger her lapel , and reach down to open her coat , suggesting sexual violation ; it's creepily well-played .
453628	15896852	21861	7.0	The Importance of Being Ernest	In Missouri , during the Civil War , " high , wide , and handsome " Gary Cooper ( as Clint Belmet ) gets a little jail cell shut-eye . Awakening , he moseys over to the local saloon , where he is held at gunpoint by the town's drunken sheriff . Mr . Cooper's guardians , Ernest Torrence ( as Bill Jackson ) and Tully Marshall ( as Jim Bridger ) , secure his release by convincing French lass Lili Damita ( as Felice ) to pretend she is Cooper's wife . Then , the quartet join a caravan to California . A real romance begins to bloom between Ms . Damita ; but , Mr . Torrence and Mr . Tully want Cooper's bachelorhood preserved . Along the way , Indians ( Native Americans ) lurk ? Old pros Torrence and Marshall are " Fighting Caravans " main attraction . They were responsible for many memorable character roles ( mostly ) in silent films ( mostly ) ; and they are in excellent form , reprising their " Covered Wagon " roles . Cooper obviously enjoys working with them . Ms . Damita is cute and effective . The production levels are relatively high , leading to the obligatory ending battle ; but , the performances make it entertaining . Unnecessarily re-made as " Wagon Wheels " ( 1934 ) , with stock footage and Randolph Scott .
452781	15896852	41928	7.0	Stewart and Allyson Hit it Out of the Park	James Stewart and June Allyson look twice as old as the roles they are playing ! Still , " The Stratton Story " is enjoyable . In the early scenes , Mr . Stewart's frame , and natural acting style , make him somewhat believable as a boy interested in baseball . Ms . Allyson doesn't try to play too " girlish " ; instead , she wisely acts her part as a woman complimenting ( by being in love with ) Stewart's character . Allyson , and her character , save the film ? the moment she appears , the focus is on the pair's relationship , and not on baseball . The Stewart / Allyson relationship is really what makes the film work , I thought - - the Stewart character could have been a golfer , doctor , whatever ? The scenes beginning with Stewart and Allyson in separate beds , backs turned , and unable to sleep , have an understated dignity . Stewart and Allyson's nice performances are enhanced by : Frank Morgan , aka " The Wizard of Oz " ; and Agnes Moorehead , Endora from " Bewitched " . The later baseball scenes are more realistic , and fun to watch . It's strange to see the older baseball style ; today , many of the players would be pumped up with steroids . I wish the sport would return to being more based on fun and skills . Love is not something a surgeon can cut . The Stratton Story ( 1949 ) Sam Wood - James Stewart , June Allyson , Frank Morgan
453610	15896852	37094	7.0	The Patience of Job Skeffington	Desirable , flirtatious Bette Davis ( as Fanny Trellis ) fends off many male admirers ; daily , they arrive at her posh New York estate , to repeatedly propose marriage . Vain , selfish , and very attractive ; Ms . Davis prefers to string her suitors along . During one cocktail hour gathering , Davis discovers her ne'er-do-well brother Richard Waring ( as Trippy Trellis ) has been embezzling funds from Jewish banker Claude Rains ( as Job Skeffington ) . To shield her beloved brother from prosecution , Davis endeavors to wed the ultra-wealthy Mr . Rains . Rains , like most men , has worshiped Davis from afar ; but , she is unable to change her coquettish lifestyle . " The most difficult aspect of the character Fanny was ( that ) she was a famous beauty of her day , " Davis observed , " I was far from being beautiful . " Yet , Davis , with her strength of personality and acting prowess , pulls off the role ; she is , as always , a great one to watch . Rains also performs well ; but , his is more of a supporting role , despite playing the title role . Walter Abel ( as George Trellis ) gets a lot of good camera time , also . And , George Coulouris is exceptional , as Davis ' astute psychoanalyst . " Mr . Skeffington " is a relatively long film , in its " restored " length . Davis and Rains were nominated for " Academy Awards " in the " Best Actress " and " Supporting Actor " categories . The film might have been cited for its decade spanning make-up work , if the category had existed back then . Mr . Skeffington ( 1944 ) Vincent Sherman - Bette Davis , Claude Rains , Walter Abel
452736	15896852	43812	7.0	Bartenders Know Everything	Broderick Crawford is terrific as a police detective going undercover as a longshoreman . The film begins with Mr . Crawford , while off-duty , investigating a shooting ; when he arrives , he's told to watch the victim by another detective - only to be left holding the victim ( so to speak ) . After his " error " , he is assigned to undercover as longshoreman at a mob-infested dock , and locate dangerous mob boss " Blackie " . On the docks , the film really takes off - the story gets very exciting , with hardly a misstep . The camera is a sharp match for the players and script . Note , Ernest Borgnine throws a swell party . Broderick says " Oh , please ? " like he was born yesterday . " The Mob " has enough twists and turns to keep the interest brewing . . . to a tight ending . The Mob ( 1951 ) Robert Parrish - Broderick Crawford , Richard Kiley , Ernest Borgnine
453303	15896852	37101	7.0	Private Dick Powell Gets Tough	Good looking film version of Raymond Chandler's " Farewell , My Lovely " , with Dick Powell taking a great career turn as private detective Philip Marlow . Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley are perfect ( and sexy ) as the two women who become involved with the storyline , and Mr . Powell . Though very well written , and adapted ( by John Paxton ) , this is still a sometimes confusing film . Mainly , it's the flashbacked story which begins the piece - - Powell is hired by burly Mike Mazurki ( as " Moose " Malloy ) , fresh out of prison , to find his old girlfriend , Velma . Director Edward Dmytryk and photographer Harry J . Wild give the film a fantastic look , despite a limited 1940s budget ; a surrealistic , drug-induced sequence fits the film perfectly . The supporting performers , like Otto Kruger , Ralf Harolde , and Esther Howard are great . Ms . Howard is particularly memorable as sobering drunk Jessie Florian ; she provides an essential clue to the film's main mystery .
453258	15896852	891527	7.0	Pigs at the Trough	Three interlocking stories - The FIRST has college Professor Robert Redford ( as Stephen Malley ) involving bright , but approaching apathetic , Andrew Garfield ( as Todd Hayes ) in intellectual warfare . The teacher / student discussion takes place in Mr . Redford's office . Flashbacks help tell the story of Michael Peña ( as Ernest Rodriguez ) and Derek Luke ( as Arian Finch ) , two former students Redford inspired ? to fight in George W . Bush's " War on Terror " . - The SECOND has soldiers Peña and Luke , struggling to stay alive , during a battle in Afghanistan . - The THIRD has journalist Meryl Streep ( as Janine Roth ) being fed a scoop , by Republican Senator Tom Cruise ( as Jasper Irving ) , revealing the military initiative involving the fate of Redford's former students . . . The BEST part of " Lions for Lambs " is the stellar " Best Supporting Actress " - caliber performance , and negligent " Media " storyline , involving Ms . Streep . With a focus on Streep's character , the film might have been a classic . Imagine the story with Streep starring - still as the reporter covering Senator Cruise , but with her own son having left Redford's classroom to join the Army . The apathy , patriotism , and politics covered by director Redford and writer Matthew Michael Carnahan is not revelatory . The real story is abdication of responsibility , by what is commonly called " The Mainstream Media " . This ( Streep's story ) is what the public needed to be hit with ? hard .

452943	15896852	118698	7.0	Unlucky Charms	Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen ( as Max ) and his dancer lover Brian Webber ( as Rudy ) are pursued by Nazis , after Mr . Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau ( as Wolf ) , in a gay club . After being captured , Owen and Mr . Weber are tortured , on a train to Germany's first concentration camp , at Dachau . Also on the train , Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau ( as Horst ) . Mr . Bluteau wears the " Pink Triangle " identifying him as a homosexual , which is considered an especially low form of human life , by the Nazis . To avoid being beaten to death , Owen pretends to be Jewish , and is given the identifying " Yellow Star " . At the concentration camp , prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love ; but , they must avoid any physical contact . The opening club / orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed , confusing fashion . It's hard to figure out what is going on - - you should , if possible , play the opening ( up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad ) twice . The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger ( as Greta ) , and the original 1979 stage production's " Max " , Ian McKellen ( as Uncle Freddie ) . Mr . Jagger also sings the haunting theme " Streets of Berlin " . Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions ; it's strange to see so little work ( film credits ) immediately followed this production . This film version of Martin Sherman's " forbidden " love story is far from perfect ; but , it's still quite captivating . The extent of " man's inhumanity to man " is , as always , horrifying . The film's non-physical sex scene , performed at the concentration camp , is extremely touching . Bent ( 1997 ) Sean Mathias - Clive Owen , Lothaire Bluteau , Mick Jagger
452542	15896852	427470	7.0	He Blew His Mind Out in a Car	High School hockey star Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( as Chris Pratt ) is a reckless driver . To watch fireflies , he turns off his car's headlights , while out on a double date with four friends . He seriously crashes . Of the foursome , two are killed , one loses a leg , and Mr . Gordon-Levitt is mild-to-moderately brain-damaged . He has trouble " sequencing " . Four years later , Gordon-Levitt has successfully mastered independent living . He receives assistance at Kansas City's " Life Skills Center " , and works nights as an evening bank janitor . Blind roommate Jeff Daniels ( as Lewis ) dreams about opening a restaurant with Gordon-Levitt . Frustrated by the limitations resulting from his head injury , Gordon-Levitt is recruited to be " The Lookout " in a bank robbery , by asthmatic ex-con Matthew Goode ( as Gary Spargo ) . Mr . Goode is plotting to rob the " Noel State Bank & Trust " , where Gordon-Levitt works . Seductive Isla Fisher ( as Luvlee Lemons ) helps to reel Gordon-Levitt into Goode's gang . The power of sex and money threatens to derail Gordon-Levitt's life . Debuting director , and acclaimed writer , Scott Frank makes a favorable debut ; shots involving doors and windows are especially effective at enhancing mood and increasing tension . Gordon-Levitt deftly refrains from overplaying the leading character's disability . Interestingly , co-stars Daniels and Goode are also disabled ( blindness and asthma ) . The performances , and story , are excellent . " The Lookout " is a film , however , which should have been improved upon . Many movies deserve to be cut , but this one could have stood some lengthening . In particular , the relationships Gordon-Levitt has with Ms . Fisher and two other women leave you wanting , and wondering . More information regarding Gordon-Levitt's brain condition could have been given ; apparently , he has a restricted driver's license ? More importantly , the struggle between Daniels and Goode , for Gordon-Levitt's soul , is too subdued . Despite what's lacking , it's a fine film .

The Good : Mr . Reagan and Ms . Sheridan are terrific . Reagan has an actor's " dream event " which is played well - but , really , he's as good ( if not better ) from the introduction ( after the kids grow up ) until the end of the movie . He and Sheridan pull the acting rug out from everyone else ! The photography is beautiful , and the opening cute . The music is swell . The Bad : Mr . Cummings has the pivotal role ; and , he doesn't have quite the right edge to put it over . He may not be entirely at fault , though ; it's not really his performance ability - more the casting , direction , and writing of this central role . For example , Cummings ' relationship with the other characters is a little hard to fathom , especially Reagan / Sheridan . The soapy stuff works in some films , but not so much in this one . No ugly . Kings Row ( 1942 ) Sam Wood - Robert Cummings , Ronald Reagan , Ann Sheridan
453487	15896852	514912	7.0	Janitorial Eloquence	New York janitor Gene Lockhart ( as Pat Cosgrave ) spends his advanced years dreaming about his home in Ireland , and playing the " Lucky Dollars " newspaper game . If he matches the paper's daily serial number with a bill , Mr . Lockhart will win the $500 . 00 jackpot . Then , he could afford a return to Ireland once before he dies . Lockhart has developed a grandfatherly interest in young stockroom worker James Dean ( as Joey Frazier ) , and his poor family . Mr . Dean's baby son has asthma , which keeps him up at night , and , unfortunately , earns him " dock time " at work . Heavily in debt , Dean can't afford to fill a $9 . 00 prescription for his son . When the time comes for the men to collect their pay , Lockhart rushes to match his dollars ' serial numbers to those in the paper . Meanwhile , hoping for a lucky break , Dean risks his wages in a poker game , with and the other workmen ? " The Bells of Cockaigne " is a short , simple , and sweet little drama . Lockhart ( actress June's father ) is an absolute delight , and Dean plays his role exceptionally well . They are helped by writer George Lowther's excellent , well-paced story ; the little " heart tug " at the end reaches just the right level of sentimentality . Versatile Vaughn Taylor ( as Jonesy ) excels in support . Karl Lukas ( as Kreuger ) , John Dennis ( as Rivnock ) , and future " Mod Squad " boss Tige Andrews ( as Sam ) can be seen among the stockroom workers . And , if you're looking for a fit young Dean in shirtless scenes , this kinescope's a good bet . The Bells of Cockaigne ( / 53 ) James Sheldon - Gene Lockhart , James Dean , Vaughn Taylor

George Clooney plays Danny , defying the odds in a split-second heist of three Vegas casinos - all owned by a magnate ( Andy Garcia ) who is dating Danny's ex-wife ( Julia Roberts ) . A fixer ( Brad Pitt ) , a pickpocket ( Matt Damon ) , a blackjack dealer ( Bernie Mac ) , a flimflammer ( Carl Reiner ) and others in well-defined roles are with Danny . Are you in or out ? " You're " in " for smooth , star-studded entertainment . The main actor is Mr . Clooney , who has developed a great , almost Cary Grant-like persona . Highlights include Mr . Damon donning a Ripley-type manner , and his well-played " confrontation " with Mr . Mac . Alan Colmes is quite an unexpected boxing fan . In sum , if you think a film can be too slick , " Ocean's Eleven " should prove it inarguably . Ocean's Eleven ( 2001 ) Steven Soderbergh - George Clooney , Brad Pitt , Matt Damon
452377	15896852	457572	7.0	Bright New World	Due to the invention of a " The Domestication Collar " , flesh-eating zombies are brought under control , and become productive members of society ; however , they perform menial tasks . The servile dead attend to those living in fenced US 1950s-styled small towns , while untamed zombies roam around in " The Wild Zone " . In the town of " Willard " , pre-teen K'Sun Ray ( as Timmy Robinson ) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker ( as Helen and Bill Robinson ) . Alas , the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ; their new neighbors , the Bottoms , have six . So , to keep up , the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly ( as Fido ) . Unfortunately , Mr . Connolly's " Domestication Collar " is damaged by an old lady's walker , and he eats her ; then , new and hungry zombies infest the town . Meanwhile , young Ray has grown attached to Connolly ( the boy and his zombie are like TV's " Timmy and Lassie " ) and , the Robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling " Zomcom " authorities . " Fido " doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing " Wild Zone " ; but , it is a colorful , stylish , and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore . Ray and the cast perform well , individually ; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett ( as Tammy ) and owner Tim Blake Nelson ( as Theopolis ) the most memorable pair . Director Andrew Currie and crew , including Rob Gray ( design ) , Jan Kiesser ( photography ) , Don MacDonald ( music ) , and James Willcock ( design ) , deservedly won awards .

452549	15896852	30418	7.0	Start the Revolution without Marie	Indulgent MGM version of the life of " Marie Antoinette " , as portrayed by Norma Shearer . The production is very beautiful looking , and well-performed . It is , however , excruciatingly long , and is without enough story embellishment to sustain interest ; an even more fictionalized account might have been a wiser course of action . Ms . Shearer must be credited with crafting an vivid character ; it's difficult , however , to feel much sympathy for her predicament , in this presentation . Robert Morley ( as Louis XVI ) elicits more sympathy , due to an almost oafish , but sensitive , portrayal ; he is impressive , in his first feature film . John Barrymore ( as Louis XV ) and Gladys George ( as du Barry ) are among those delivering expert support . Particularly recommended for viewers with a longer life span than Marie Antoinette .

453361	15896852	23590	7.0	A Match Made for Ann Dvorak	Unevenly distributed story of three school girls who cross paths again , as adults . Ann Dvorak ( as Vivian Revere ) is , arguably , the film's star ; she plays a sensible , dark-haired beauty who seems to be on the receiving end of life's luckier breaks , but remains unsatisfied . Joan Blondell ( as Mary Keaton ) receives almost as much attention ; she's a " bad girl " who becomes an actress after a stint in reform school . Ms . Blondell contrasts Ms . Dvorak by turning from " bad " to " good " . Bette Davis ( as Ruth Westcott ) rounds out the trio ; she's a sweet and sexy blonde , who fills in both swimsuit and secretarial pools . Dvorak's unfulfilled , desperate housewife steals the high acting honors ; her drug and alcohol drenched characterization is a triumph . Her 1932 performances in " Three on a Match " and " Scarface " might have earned Dvorak some " Best Actress " notice , if times were different . Interestingly , Ms . Davis ' performance is adequate , but bland ; while Blondell is heartfelt and likable . The three actresses illustrate perfectly how essential it is for a capable performer to get the good part ; this is a lesson Davis learned very well - - she wasn't going to let the kind of distribution of roles evident in " Three on a Match " go on for long . The men are almost as much fun as the women . Warren William is natural ( and unrehearsed ) as Dvorak's " perfect " husband , and tempting Lyle Talbot proves himself a sexy lure . Great gangsters include Humphrey Bogart as an intuitive " Harve " , Allen Jenkins as a solid " Dick " , and Edward Arnold as a sure " Ace " . However , Buster Phelps ' " Junior " is dreadfully out-of-place ; as his performance belongs in a Shirley Temple film , not here ; otherwise , Mervyn LeRoy's direction is outstanding . The film seems to put itself on " fast forward " much of the time , giving some of its flawed story elements an even more disjointed feeling . Thankfully , the movie's title is explained therein : " The saying ' Three on a Match means one will die soon ' did not originate in the war , where it was said that to hold a match burning long enough for three lights would attract enemy fire . It did originate with Ivar Kreuger , the Swedish match king , who wanted the world to use more matches . It is reported that the saying brings his companies $5 , 000 , 000 more revenue annually . " You'll see which actress gets the third match .
453321	15896852	12839	7.0	Oh Danny Boy , the Pipes Are Calling	The disclaimer opening doth protest too much , methinks : " Since the days of Plato and Socrates there have been many men of wisdom , but none sage enough to solve the struggle eternal between Capitol ( Business ) and Labor . We do not do not seek to work out the problems of their issue but desire to show the story of the lives of two men as a story and nothing more . " Of course , " The Whistle " unashamedly deals with workplace safety , despite its claim of " nothing more " . Laborer William S . Hart ( as Robert Evans ) lives in the New England town of Chappleville , which is owned and operated by his wealthy boss , Frank Brownlee ( as Henry Chapple ) . Mr . Hart lives with his adolescent son , Will Jim Hatton ( as Danny Evans ) ; " Mrs . Evans " having died during childbirth . Mr . Brownlee lives with wife Myrtle Stedman ( as Mrs . Chapple ) and baby Richard Headrick ; later , baby grows into boy Georgie Stone . Hart regular Bob Kortman ( as Scardon ) has a pivotal role . Hart and company make a bold statement picture , which is also shamelessly emotional entertainment ; and , the star is so effective in the " non-western " lead role , it's a shame he saddled up so much more than not . Hart and Hatton are so convincing as father and son , you can't help but sympathize with Hart . His face shows his son's soul being ripped from Hart , after his gut-wrenching workplace incident . Hart conscientiously carries the remainder of the film well ; but , given the melodramatics , the ending is unnecessarily a downer for one cast member .

453298	15896852	32383	7.0	A Wish for Walsh's Last Command	John Wayne ( as Bob Seton ) stars in a Civil War-era film wherein he runs for Marshall of a Kansas town , against wicked schoolteacher Walter Pidgeon ( as Will Cantrell ) . Of course , they are rivals for the attention of a woman - beautiful Claire Trevor ( as Mary McCloud ) . Roy Rogers adds additional charm as brother McCloud . The story is rather more ordinary than intriguing , but the western scores on several fronts ? First , the direction by Raoul Walsh is outstanding . The production is well-mounted ; it includes the expected exciting climax , but that's not all . . . Even better than the climatic ending is a spectacular sequence involving a stagecoach . Don't miss it ! The indoor scenes are great , too . Watch the scenes in the Barber Shop , for example : witness the sets , direction , and photography . The placement of characters and objects , along with the great street outdoors , provide terrific visual depth . The story doesn't do the production justice , however . And , some of the performances are merely adequate ; and , sometimes they seem unfocused . Mr . Pidgeon's is probably the most consistent of the main players . Mr . Wayne and some of the players might have improved with some additional worked on their characterizations ; and , if the story was sharper , " Dark Command " might have been a truer classic .

453186	15896852	66387	7.0	Where There's Smoke , There's Fire	After helplessly witnessing his father's death , in a fiery car accident , 14-year-old California boy Ronny Howard ( as Chris Long ) goes into shock . Overcoming some grief , young Howard must adjust to life with a new stepfather , Earl Holliman ( as Cal Fitch ) . Although Mr . Holliman tries to be fatherly , he only opens old wounds . Howard wants his real father . That is not possible , but could Howard have a dog ? Mr . Holliman turns his stepson's request down , as a dog's presence would disrupt Holliman's sheep ranching business . When Howard finds a " wild dog " , wounded in the woods , he is defiantly determined to keep the animal . " Smoke " is a great story ; it's one of those symbolic animal tales the Disney studio favored , and often did so well . This one surely benefited from William Corbin's original book ( adapted by John Furia Jr . ) - the young man's transference of love to , and identification with , the wounded animal is nicely done . But , the story's more subtle symbolism ( like the " fox in the hen-house " ) is even better . The climatic , heavy-handed " rescue from fire " isn't as satisfying ; but , this is mainly due to budget restraints . " Smoke " could have stood up as a first class feature presentation . Howard and Holliman do well , as the disconnected son and stepfather . Of course , Howard uses his acting education , from years of appearing in Andy Griffith's " Mayberry " ; still , this is a strong , individual characterization - and , it shows Howard to be very capable between his two long-running typecasts ( " Opie " and Richie " ) . Jacqueline Scott ( as Fran Long Fitch ) makes the most of the more minor mother / wife role , lifting the picture with a couple of very strongly performed dramatic scenes . With Pamelyn Ferdin and Andy Devine in the cast , " Smoke " is cute and irresistible . Smoke ( - ) Vincent McEveety - Ron Howard , Earl Holliman , Jacqueline Scott
453147	15896852	4181	7.0	Griffith Makes it Reels	Upon release , the said to be the longest film feature ever - the biblical-era " Judith of Bethulia " . Notably directed by D . W . Griffith , it's really not as good as some of his previous releases ; in hindsight , its length is perhaps its most remembered feature . The story centers on Judith ( Blanche Sweet ) courageously figuring to save her city ( Bethulia ) from the invading army of the conqueror Holofernes ( Henry B . Walthall ) . To wit , Ms . Sweet dresses herself up in order to seduce Mr . Walthall . She looks more ridiculous than seductive , with what looks like a peacock on her head . Walthall's other ladies , and eunuch ( ! ) , look more fetching . A marvelous actor , Walthall doesn't have much to do in " Judith " . The acting honors are stolen , early on , by Mae Marsh and Robert Harron , perhaps because they were directed to walk around without over-emoting . There are some exciting battle sequences .

453455	15896852	32366	7.0	Tod Slaughter Slays ' Em	" A deranged man murders another man in order to assume his identity and take over a recently inherited estate . Soon after arriving at the estate , the psychotic man finds he must continue his murderous tendencies in order to keep his charade from being exposed . As the number of victims increase , along with his deepening madness , it becomes a matter of time before all is revealed and the man's true identity is exposed , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Thespian Tod Slaughter ( posing as Percival Glyde ) receives a rude awakening when he discovers the man whose head he hammered to death , " Sir Percival " , was penniless . In order to keep the man's estate , he goes ahead with an arranged wedding to pretty Garbo-light Sylvia Marriott ( as Laurie Fairlie ) . After a tearful wedding night , Ms . Marriott tries to distance herself from the repulsive Mr . Slaughter , who is trying to get her to sign over her fortune . When Marriott won't cooperate , Slaughter has her locked in a cell as " The Woman in White " , a ghostly apparition seen around the family mansion . Slaughter must also contend with cast members he hasn't been able to murder , like wormy Hay Petrie ( as Isidor Fosco ) . " Crimes in the Dark House " isn't very successful at adapting the Wilkie Collins novel , but it makes a great vehicle for Tod Slaughter - a thoroughly delightful actor in peak performance mode .

453389	15896852	43625	7.0	John Garfield's Last Shot	After a heist goes wrong , cop killer John Garfield ( as Nick Robey ) is on the run . Taking cover in a public swimming pool , Mr . Garfield meets plain Shelley Winters ( as Peg Dobbs ) . Flattery gets him everywhere ; and , Garfield uses Ms . Winters for getaway cover . Starved for the manly affection , Winters mistakes his advances for interest . Soon , Winters has Garfield in her apartment , to meet the family . When he feels the police closing in , Garfield holds up in Winters ' apartment , holding the family hostage . Desperate hours ensue ? It's difficult to understand Winters ' continued naivety ; and , the " family held hostage " plot doesn't ring quite true . Still , Garfield's paranoia , and Winters ' character development make it well worth watching . Sadly , this was Garfield's final film ; he died within a year , at age 39 . Director John Berry and photographer James Wong Howe make it look great . " He Ran All the Way " boasts a fine supporting cast , led by Wallace Ford . And , the ending grows with an exciting , thought-provoking intensity .
452555	15896852	39216	7.0	The Bowery Boys Go West	While Huntz Hall ( as Horace Debussy " Sach " Jones ) reads " Hair Trigger Western Yarns " , sweet shop proprietor Bernard Gorcey ( as Louie ) sings " Louie , the Lout " to Bobby Jordan ( as Bobby ) , William " Billy " Benedict ( as Whitey ) , and David Gorcey ( as Chuck ) . Wrapped up in his western pulp stories , Mr . Hall daydreams about the days of " Cowboys & Indians " , and " Louie " hints about a western past . . . Suddenly , a sheriff enters the scene , on horseback ; he claims " Louie , the Lout ' is a WANTED outlaw . Then , Bowery leader Leo Gorcey ( as Slip Mahoney ) arrives to find ( his real-life father ) the elder Gorcey hiding from the sheriff . Gorcey takes " The Bowery Boys " out west , to solve the case of the falsely accused " Louie " . The New York City group meet up with Cowboys and Native American Indians , in an old-fashioned western setting . Bowery chum Gabriel Dell ( as Gabe ) arrives in the town ( " Hangman's Hollow " ) , undercover as " The Klondike Kid " , to help the " Bowery Buckaroos " clear " Louie " and locate a gold mine . This is one of the cleverest movies in the " Bowery Boys " series . Gorcey delivers some of his best " malaprops " ( a nude baby picture is " Exhibition A " ) ; and the rest of the cast is uniformly smooth . The story is very nicely plotted , with Mr . Hall figuring prominently . " Marshall " Minerva Urecal and " Indian " Iron Eyes Cody are terrific . Regulars Bernard Gorcey and Gabriel Dell have good roles , too . And , this is the last appearance of Bobby Jordan , who was in the originally named " Dead End " ( 1937 ) group . In the early 1940s , Mr . Jordan was featured much more prominently in these films - the stories were often about his character - but , as the comic antics of Gorcey and Hall took center stage , Jordan was derailed by both " Uncle Sam " and injury . In " Bowery Buckaroos " , Jordan leads the secondary " Bowery Boys " in making the most out of their supporting roles . It's a shame the producers couldn't work Jordan into more stories , perhaps in spin-offs Mr . Benedict's " Whitey " character ( they have some good " bits " herein ) . In future films , Jordan will be missed . Bowery Buckaroos ( / 47 ) William Beaudine - Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall , Bobby Jordan
453074	15896852	138304	7.0	Pray for Rosemary's Babies in Orbit	" Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron star as courageous NASA astronaut Spencer Armacost and his beautiful schoolteacher wife Jillian , a seemingly perfect couple whose lives are momentarily shattered when Spencer's mission mysteriously loses contact with Earth for two minutes . But neither Spencer nor Jillian know that those 120 seconds of terror will ultimately threaten their sanity , their future and their lives in this heart stopping psychological thriller the critics call , ' One scary edge-of-the-seat nightmare ' , " according to the film's official synopsis . Everything you see about this movie gives away the story ; the trailer makes the plot obvious , and every other critic compares it to " Rosemary's Baby " ( 1968 ) . Indeed , it is an updated version of Roman Polanski's classic , with Aliens substituted for Satan - the old devil has clearly been replaced as top villain , after his 1960s-1970s heyday . Although nothing is outlined , anyone with rudimentary knowledge about plotting will figure out what's happening in " The Astronaut's Wife " ; its flaw is that it takes no real risks . Even the swipe has been done . Ms . Theron is the lead . She and Mr . Depp look great ( eyebrow and hair color are perfect ) , but Theron only has a couple of scenes approaching the level of Mia Farrow's characterization in " Rosemary's Baby " . She looks almost too good during her pregnancy , whereas Ms . Farrow looked more and more sickly . Director Rand Ravich shows promise more as a director than writer . Allen Daviau's photography is excellent . The film is so derivative it dims the impact of some excellent supporting performances , led by a dazzling Joe Morton ( as Sherman Reese ) . The moronic ending should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes hell . . . before that , the film's strengths outweigh its weaknesses .

452498	15896852	2350	7.0	Indian Giver	Important early film , directed by D . W . Griffith . Stephen ( Wilfred Lucas ) wants to marry his young ward Blanche Sweet and raise a family . She thinks it's a good idea - until she meets young Charles West . Of course , Mr . Lucas wants to kill Mr . West for coming between he and Ms . Sweet . Lucas , however , decides her happiness is more important ; he gives the couple his blessing ( and home ) ; then , he re-joins the Army . Years pass . Sweet , West , and baby join a Wagon Train . When the Wagon train is attacked by Indians ( Native Americans ) , Lucas arrives to serve as its military escort . Watch for some great shots - like , the distant Wagon Train moving along with a bear in the foreground . The battle scenes are as exciting as you'd expect them to be in a Griffith production . In fact , the battles in " The Massacre " look more realistically fought than in thousands of subsequent westerns . Also noteworthy is Griffith's presentation of the " Indians " . Watch some of the Indians ' body movements , and the way the camera lingers over some of their dead bodies - characters previously introduced sympathetically . Griffith presents Native American characters in a far more sympathetic manner than is usual for the time ( and director ) . The film loses this characterization as the film progresses . The Indians ' point-of-view is dropped . The " love triangle " of characters from the beginning end up only remotely involved in each others ' lives ; and , " The Massacre " misses out on some obvious dramatic possibilities for Sweet , Lucas , and West .

453112	15896852	439	7.0	The Greatest Parting Shot	Masked bandits enter a railroad office , and tie up the telegraph operator ; they are planning " The Great Train Robbery " . When the approaching train makes its pit stop , the robbers jump aboard . The bandits find their booty in a box , which they blow up , after a bit of shooting . Next , the bandits force the train passengers to lineup , and loot their valuables . Meanwhile , the railroad operator has recovered , and rounds up a posse ; then , they go after the robbers ? A landmark Edwin S . Porter film , with future western star Gilbert M . " Broncho Billy " Anderson . The lasting image , and film highlight , however , is Justin D . Barnes firing away , in the film's closing seconds . It still packs a punch , since the final shot is so unexpectedly different from the rest of the film .
453091	15896852	37366	7.0	The Johnson Airplane	Sturdy , determined Spencer Tracy ( as James " Jimmy " Doolittle ) organizes the US response to the World War II attack on Pearl Harbor . Mr . Tracy , and the film , make it obvious the Japanese stood no chance of besting our American forces . Note the number of men who respond to Mr . Tracy's repeated invitations to " drop out " of the dangerous mission . Despite Tracy's presence , the film stars Van Johnson ( as Ted Lawson ) . Mr . Johnson's performance is , at times , reminiscent of a younger Tracy ; in context , it's a little distracting . Still , Johnson essays the star-making sacrifice , begun by John Gilbert in MGM's " The Big Parade " , effectively . Despite the big parade of men lining up to go fight in the actual war , MGM was able to find a great cast of available men ; who were , presumably , persuaded to postpone enlisting . Among the servicemen , Robert Walker ( as David Thatcher ) is a clear stand-out . At home , Phyllis Thaxter ( as Ellen Lawson ) is sweet and refreshing . And , making the most of a small role would have to be Robert Mitchum ( as Bob Gray ) . The story is very good , albeit heavily clichéd on film ; it was based on the real Ted Lawson's story . Director Mervyn LeRoy's film version features fine music and photography . The highlight of " Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo " is the exciting , and well-constructed , title event .

452541	15896852	348150	7.0	Brandon Routh Takes Flight	After a soul-searching sabbatical , to see what remains of home planet Krypton , " Superman Returns " to Earth . The Man of Steel knew , as most everyone does , that it was destroyed ; but , astronomers thought they found Krypton . Superman took similar trips in the original DC Comics , but for differing reasons ; and , never for five years . Anyway , he returns , first , to Smallville , where widowed Ma Kent ( Eva Marie Saint ) tends the family farm . Then , it's over to Metropolis , where , disguised as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent , he picks up where he left off , at " The Daily Planet " . In his absence , Superman's ( ex - ) Girl Friend , Lois Lane ( Kate Bosworth ) has hooked up with managing editor Perry White ( Frank Langella ) ' s handsome nephew Richard ( James Marsden ) . Lex Luthor ( Kevin Spacey ) has been released from prison . Lois has " moved on " by writing a Pulitzer Prize winning article explaining , " " Why the World Doesn't Need Superman . " Lois and Richard White are parenting a coincidently 5-year-old kid named Jason ( Tristan Lake Leabu ) , who looks suspiciously like " Planet " photographer Jimmy Olsen ( Sam Huntington ) . Well , he does . Super-veterans Marlon Brando , Jack Larson , and Noel Neill have cameos . Bryan Singer's film is mostly successful . Mainly , this is due to the title character being a very well cast Brandon Routh . He not only looks the part , but also evokes Christopher Reeve , the man who remains the standard . Without Mr . Routh's convincing portrayal , there is no movie . The special effects are also worthy . Mr . Singer wisely ignores " Superman III " and " IV " , opting for a partial origin , and sequel to " Superman II " . This is where problems begin ; in an already too long film , why are we re-visiting Superboy ? With thousands of villainous stories available , why re-vamp the old Luthor plot ? The film relies more on prior movies than original source material . There is , also , little " chemistry " between key players . This is especially noticeable in the sexless " Lois & Clark " relationship . Ms . Bosworth seems more like a Lana Lang-type , anyway ; she and Mr . Marsden would be very convincing as friends from " The Legion of Super-Heroes " ( Insect Queen and Ultra Boy , for example ) . Hopefully , future " Superman " installments will explain the asthmatic piano player , and reveal how Superman able to lift a huge chunk of Green Kryptonite into space . Despite the weaknesses , it's an entertaining flight . Superman Returns ( 2006 ) Bryan Singer - Brandon Routh , Kate Bosworth , Kevin Spacey

Still , toreador Valentino excels in the dangerous sport ; and , later , he is wealthy and famous throughout Spain . Along the way , he marries virtuous childhood sweetheart Lila Lee ( as Carmen ) . For Valentino , temptation accompanies fame , as he falls under the spell of wicked temptress Nita Naldi ( as Doña Sol ) , a slightly sadomasochistic bullfighting groupie . Can Valentino love two women at the same time ? Valentino performs well as an innocent ragamuffin who achieves great fame ; of course , this parallels the idolization of the film's star . Moreover , the Idol proves just as attractive being seduced ( herein , by Ms . Naldi ) as he was the seducer ( in the recent " Sheik " ) . Fred Niblo's " Blood and Sand " is a classic ; however , the story , and disjointed bullfighting footage , do bog things down . Great things happen , after about a quarter hour , when Valentino steps into Naldi's lair . In a neat bit of acting business , Valentino wipes a sweaty hand before greeting his seductress ; then , he and Naldi's servant exchange weird looks as Valentino gets his cigarette lighted . After some crosscutting to innocent Ms . Lee , Naldi's harp-playing gets her man . Writer June Mathis adapts well , for her star ; but , the Ibáñez story should have more streamlined . Combining , or further developing , the characters played by Charles Belcher ( Don Joselito ) and Walter Long ( Plumitas ) might have helped . Mr . Belcher's character is most interesting ; he collects torture devices , and choruses the film's thesis : " Happiness and prosperity built on cruelty and bloodshed cannot survive .

453138	15896852	332452	7.0	Brad Pitt's Achilles ' Heel	" Brad Pitt picks up a sword and brings a muscular , brooding presence to the role of Greek warrior Achilles in this spectacular retelling of ' The Iliad ' . Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger play the legendary lovers who plunge the world into war , Eric Bana portrays the prince who dares to confront Achilles , and Peter O'Toole rules Troy as King Priam . Director Wolfgang Petersen recreates a long-ago world of mighty warships , clashing armies , the massive fortress city , and the towering Trojan Horse . " Director Peterson does a good job keeping this long , big-budgeted epic rolling ; especially , he is good with the chest-piercing battle scenes . The film's thesis ; a more plausible , historically , version of the mythological " Iliad " , is a good one - if only the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt hadn't burned , we'd know so much more about the era ? Although the film is beautifully produced , the computer generated " look " is , at times , distracting ; don't look too carefully , for example , at those mighty warships . During the picture , Brad Pitt was experiencing a second wave of mega-box office popularity ; and , while his on screen presence undoubtedly thrilled millions , he is not entirely successful in the " Achilles " role . The camera treats Mr . Pitt as a drugstore paperback novel cover boy - with biceps and blond mane prominently displayed . He is obviously trying to essay the role , but Pitt most often looks to be simply posed . Consequently , the usually ultra-sexy Pitt appears almost sexless . Rose Byrne's " Briseis " helps , though ? The more sexy story involves Orlando Bloom's " Paris " irritating big brother Eric Bana's " Hector " by taking Diane Kruger's " Helen " as his lover . Of the four " hot " young leads ( if you count Pitt , Bloom , Kruger , and Bana ) , Mr . Bana comes off the best , with Ms . Kruger edging out Mr . Bloom as the prettiest . Peter O'Toole and a strong supporting cast look as good , if not better , than the stars . Worth checking out , for the spectacle ( great art direction / set direction & costume design ) - and for Eric Bana's acting one-upmanship .

After awhile , luck turns for Tracy , and he goes to get Sydney to the alter . On the way through a small town , he is stopped by Walter Brennan ; turns out , Tracy fits the description of a wanted kidnapper . The townspeople don't want to wait for a trial - they want a lynching . You won't believe how the story evolves ? " Fury " has a lot going for it - Mr . Tracy performs supremely . The direction and photography are likewise excellent - by Fritz Lang and Joseph Ruttenberg . Moreover , he film addresses interesting , thought-provoking topics ; and , it makes a good case for justice and the rule of law . On the down side , I did find some of the other performances inconsistent . The biggest problem with the film , however , the stretch you have to make to believe the characters as the movie progresses . It takes a lot of twists and turns , which are entertaining ; yet , the characters Tracy and Sidney play are stretched to the breaking point by a script that goes in so many directions .

The situation changes several times over the course of the film ; but , basically , Warwick wants to lead the straight life , as a banker family man - - however , he is haunted by the past . Director Maurice Tourneur makes this a visually exciting silent drama ; many of the images are beautifully done . Warwick is remarkable in the lead role . Johnny Hines ( as Red Joclyn ) and Alec B . Francis ( as Bill Avery ) are also very good - - the story livens up whenever they are on-screen with Warwick ; the three are so good , you'll want them to pull a few more heists ! However , there is no corresponding chemistry with Ms . Shepley ; and , the children perform like wind-up dolls . " Alias Jimmy Valentine " is , unfortunately , not as exciting as it's production or direction . Still , it's quite an achievement for 1915 .
452501	15896852	2795	7.0	A Marathon Worth Running	Interesting early film , directed by D . W . Griffith . Walter Miller and Henry B . Walthall are partners in business , and rivals for the affections of Blanche Sweet . Ms . Sweet chooses Mr . Walthall , and the two are married . Soon , he goes out on the town , leaving her and the baby home alone . Then , Mr . Miller realizes Walthall is stealing from their company to pay off gambling debts ? This film is given great depth by Griffith's use of windows , doorways , and a mirror in background shots The performances are noteworthy , especially Walthall and Sweet , during the film's climax . A contemporary automobile is featured in the exciting race to save Walthall's life . For it's time , this must have been a shocker . The absence of blood is strange , but the performances make " Death's Marathon " worth running . Death's Marathon ( 1913 ) D . W . Griffith - Henry B . Walthall , Blanche Sweet , Walter Miller
452944	15896852	67805	7.0	Murray Head Superstar	Jewish doctor Peter Finch ( as Daniel Hirsh ) and divorcée Glenda Jackson ( as Alex Greville ) are both sharing their beds , and bodies , with bisexual artist Murray Head ( as Bob Elkin ) . Alas , Mr . Head wants to leave London for New York , alone , on a bloody Sunday . But , he promises to return " soon " . Mr . Finch and Ms . Jackson will be very lonely without Head . They will go from sharing " half a loaf " of Head , to going with none at all . Director John Schlesinger's follow-up to his " Midnight Cowboy " masterpiece is , as expected , extraordinarily well-directed . However , the relationships do not excite ; and , they are difficult to understand . Jackson and Head are the more believable . Finch and Head try hard ; but , their man-on-man passion does not come across well ; in fact , there were more sparks between Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in Schlesinger's subtler " Cowboy " . There are many lovingly detailed scenes , beautifully photographed by Billy Williams . Past " Superstar " Bessie Love acts as the answering service lady , and future " Superstar " Daniel Day-Lewis appears as a very naughty boy . Bed-hopping Head co-starred on the " Jesus Christ Superstar " LP play , during " Sunday Bloody Sunday " ; and , his single version of " Superstar " celebrated two runs on the US Pop charts . Everybody's a bloody " Superstar " ! Sunday Bloody Sunday ( 1971 ) John Schlesinger - Peter Finch , Glenda Jackson , Murray Head
452675	15896852	492912	7.0	Death Becomes Him	Unsuccessful student Christian Oliver ( as Adam Schmidt ) is smart enough ; but , he is failing to make the medical school grade . Possibly , this is due to his frequent headaches , and an anti-social disposition . Mr . Oliver explains , " I think I'm allergic to people . " After receiving a " F " on his ethics essay , Oliver decides to " drop out " ; and , quickly , he responds to an invitation from mysterious doctor Dean Stapleton ( as Ethan , aka " Dr . Vick " ) . So , Oliver goes to live with Mr . Stapleton , in an isolated , snowbound cabin . You should know Stapleton has gruesome plans for Oliver . Stapleton wants to murder his house-guest , and bring him back to life . " Subject Two " is quite an intriguing take on the old life-creating " Frankenstein " plot . The film is very bright , and well-photographed . The lonely cabin , set in the vast and sparsely populated mountains , is a worthy setting . Rich Confalone's photography is beautiful . Writer / director Philip Chidel , who also appears as " Subject One " , and the two lead actors are also excellent . The story could have been a little clearer . For example ? well , you'll see ? Still , it's an interesting slice of intellectual gore , and a definite career peak for those involved . Its very weirdness is most welcome . Subject Two ( 2006 ) Philip Chidel - Christian Oliver , Dean Stapleton , Philip Chidel
453043	15896852	18097	7.0	From Beyond the Unknown	As of October 20 , 2007 , " London After Midnight " is a lost film - there is no known surviving footage . Hopefully , a print or portion will be discovered . Until then , TCM's 2002 reconstruction , by Rick Schmidlin , will have to suffice - it was created by referencing the original script and utilizing movie photograph still . Robert Israel provided a representative musical score . Cheers to all involved ! Before viewing the restoration by Mr . Schmidlin , consider watching the other Tod Browning ( director ) , Lon Cheney ( actor ) , and Merritt B . Gerstad ( cameraman ) collaboration " The Unknown " ( 1927 ) ; it may provide the best indication of how " London After Midnight " might have looked on the motion picture screen . Then , see Browning's re-make " Mark of the Vampire " ( 1935 ) ; its script closely follows " London After Midnight " , and it will help explain some story elements limited by the movie stills available . I'm speculating the performances of Lon Chaney ( as Prof . Edward Burke ) and Henry B . Walthall ( as Sir James Hamlin ) were noteworthy , but the story disappointing . Conrad Nagel ( as Arthur Hibbs ) must have been very impressive ; he would shortly co-star with none other than Greta Garbo , in 1928 and 1929 films . And , certainly , Marceline Day was lovely ( as Lucille Balfour ) . London After Midnight ( 1927 ) Tod Browning - Lon Chaney , Henry B . Walthall , Conrad Nagel
452504	15896852	65656	7.0	Helmut Berger is Dorian Gray	The story is familiar - Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray wishes his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . This film version certainly does not equal the production quality of Albert Lewin's " The Picture of Dorian Gray " ( 1945 ) , but it is superior in several other ways . Foremost , the casting of Helmut Berger as Dorian is perfect . Mr . Berger has the " beautiful / handsome " balance necessary to essay the role ; he matches his looks with a fine performance , taking Dorian from youth to decadence . Richard Todd ( as Basil ) and Herbert Lom ( as Henry ) support Berger well . Dorian's decadent slide is more appropriately depicted in this " modernized " version ; however , the sexual situations run on way too long - for a time , the screen is filled with one sexual romp after another ; and , the film loses focus . The sexual situations must have been very risqué at the time , but " Dorian Gray " is not " X-rated " . The film may remain titillating because there are numerous sexual escapades ; and , Mr . Berger and the women are very attractive . The final " confrontation " between Dorian and Basil is used to effectively begin this version with a flashback ; it might have helped to begin the 1945 version in this manner . The passage of time could have been better depicted during the early part ( the 1940s-1950s ) of this 1970 version , but the 1960s look terrific . The aging of Dorian's portrait is much more realistic in this version , and it somehow seems much truer to the spirit of Oscar Wilde's original work .

453313	15896852	25610	7.0	Down on the Farm	King Vidor's " The Crowd " ( 1928 ) ended hopefully : James Murray and Eleanor Boardman ( then playing John and Mary Sims ) conquered the industrialized , impersonal City , with a new job and child replacing previous losses . But , the Sims ' luck is , according to this film , cut short by the Great Depression . Tom Keene and Karen Morley ( now playing John and Mary Sims ) are sans job and money . With nothing to lose , the couple moves out to farm some country land owned by Ms . Morley's uncle . Mr . Keene organizes the locals into a communal society ; but , nature and a woman threaten the Sims ' success . Although the lead characters resemble their namesakes from director Vidor's " The Crowd " ; their tale , proclaimed as " Inspired by Headlines of Today " , is derived from a " Reader's Digest " story . The characters do not share factual similarities with the original John and Mary Sims ; for example , no reference is made to their children . Vidor directed , and Keene acted , the " John " role inappropriately . Several of the supporting players are also unsuitable . Morley's Garbo-like " Mary " is a bright spot among the performances , though . Barbara Pepper answers " Garbo " with a Harlow-like " Sally " . It's the closest you'll get to having Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow in the same film . However , the attempted " city girl " temptation of Keene , by Ms . Pepper , is not convincing . Interestingly , Pepper returned to country life in the 1960s , as the wife of " Fred Ziffel " , on TV's " Green Acres " . The irrigating ending is unexpectedly exhilarating .

453415	15896852	649	7.0	Robert Harron Makes an Impression	Historically important as Robert Harron's first starring feature , " Bobby's Kodak " ( February 10 , 1908 ) also features Biograph cameraman G . W . Bitzer . It was directed by Wallace McCutcheon . Mr . Harron started playing " bit " parts at the studio in late 1907 as an after school job , with future film editor James Smith . Collaborator D . W . Griffith had yet to arrive . " Jim and I were earning five dollars a week , " Harron recalled in a February 8 , 1920 newspaper interview with Louella Parsons , " At that time , five dollars was considered a big salary for a boy . We were proud of ourselves until we started playing regular parts . And then , we used to hold indignation meetings , and say if the company didn't realize our value , we would leave ; a threat which never worried anyone , and which we never carried out . " Happily , the boys stayed with Biograph , and met director Griffith the following year ; thus , with Mr . Bitzer , the ingredients for movie magic were stirred . Unhappily , " Bobby's Kodak " is a lost film . Here is Harron's synopsis : " ' Bobby's Kodak ' was the title . I was the infant terrible , and I snapped my father kissing the maid , mother flirting with the butler , the nurse maid having an affair with the cop . Later , I showed all the pictures ; and , the pandemonium that followed has some of our best slapstick comedies looking lifeless . There was a chase - Edward Dillon played my father , and it was from his irate grasp I had to escape . " Bobby's Kodak ( 1908 ) Wallace McCutcheon - Robert Harron , Edward Dillon
453102	15896852	12752	7.0	Fairbanks Fences In	Impoverished nobleman Douglas Fairbanks ( as D'Artagnan ) ' s greatest ambition is to join the King's royal swordsmen , " The Three Musketeers " . And , after impressing the three best swordsmen in Paris , Mr . Fairbanks becomes their fourth blade . He also finds love , with Marguerite De La Motte ( as Constance ) , and much palace intrigue . Nigel de Brulier ( as Cardinal Richelieu ) makes life particularly irksome , involving Fairbanks and friends in schemes against weak a King Adolphe Menjou ( as Louis XIII ) , and his unfaithful Queen Mary MacLaren ( as Anne ) . Alexandre Dumas ' classic is a perfect vehicle for Fairbanks ; who , after the success of his " Zorro " , struck box office gold with a series of classy audience pleasing productions . While this is not the best " Musketeers " movie , it's certainly true that Fairbanks ' 1920s films had an indelible impact upon subsequent adaptations . Fairbanks , through the force of his personality , didn't so much " play " characters like " D'Artagnan " as much as he made the characters play him . Fred Niblo ( director ) and Arthur Edeson ( photographer ) create a great swashbuckling atmosphere . Nigel de Brulier steals the acting honors , with his cunning , cat-stroking " Richelieu " ; the best supporting player will reprise his role in a trio of additional " Musketeers " films , including the superior Fairbanks sequel " The Iron Mask " ( 1929 ) . Pretty " leading lady " De La Motte ( from " Zorro " ) and others will also return . After all , it is . . . " All for one and one for all . "
453282	15896852	12755	7.0	Maid in America	In Belgium , during the summer of 1903 wealthy widow Gertrude Astor ( as Louise Bodamere ) finds well-heeled second husband Wilfred Lucas ( as Elton Reeves ) at a North Sea resort . While Ms . Astor and Mr . Lucas enjoy the beach , her daughter Jeanne is cared for by loyal nurse Helen Raymond ( as Marie Gaston ) . Lucas says he doesn't like children ; and mother Astor replies , " Don't be unreasonable , dear - - we probably won't see her more than once a day . " Still , husband Lucas has his way ; and , the newlyweds desert little Jeanne for a luxurious life in the United States . Mary Pickford ( as Jeanne ) is raised as a peasant girl in Belgium , by faithful nurse Raymond . " If it were not for New York hotels , were would elopers , divorcées and red plush furniture go ? " Five years later , her mother returns for Pickford But , Raymond can't give her up ; and , she tells Astor her daughter is dead . By 1914 , the beginning Great War ( World War I ) helps Raymond reconsider keeping the now 15-year-old girl ; and , Pickford is sent to America . She enters " Through the Back Door " of Ellis Island . Through the happenstance of film , Pickford becomes a maid in her own mother's household ; there , she discovers a plot to break up her mother's troubled marriage . And , she finds romance with boy next door John Harron ( as Billy Boy ) . There are a lot of stories in " Through the Back Door " - - perhaps , there are too many . The introductory title cards explain : " This is a love story - - A vision seen through the tears of a mother and a forgotten child - - It echoes the story God whispers to each tiny soul before He blesses it with the miracle of Life - - The story of mother-love . " This description is , in hindsight , somewhat deceptive . And , the story of the " mother-love " between Astor and Pickford is one of the story's least satisfying strands . Instead , enjoy the " little girl " Pickford in the post-abandonment scenes ; especially , when Pickford cleans the mud off the floor wearing scrub brushes as roller-skates ; and wipes her muddy feet on a conveyor belt . After she moves to America , Pickford's romance with Mr . Harron is very sweet ; their meeting effectively sexualizes the mud play seen earlier . It was very nice of Pickford to include John Harron as her " leading man " ; his brother , Robert Harron , died of a gunshot wound the preceding year . Undoubtedly , Pickford admired the deceased Harron's work ( they worked together , at " Biograph " ) . " Laugh and your husband laughs with you , weep , and he laughs with someone else . " Another story receiving a lot of screen time is the faltering marriage of Astor and Lucas , due to the presences of flirty Elinor Fair ( as Margaret Brewster ) . The " love triangle " of the three , complicated by Adolphe Menjou ( as James Brewster ) works about as well at the " mother-love " story between story and Pickford - - or , not very well . The characters ' actions are , simply , not always credible . The location and sets are very pleasing . The directorial team of Alfred E . Green and ( Mary's brother ) Jack Pickford works very well . The ending is another strength ; after Pickford and Harron close the curtains on their parents , they look out a window of uncertainty and excitement .
453429	15896852	33677	7.0	Intriguing Story with Race Reservations	Bette Davis ( as Maggie ) and Mary Astor ( as Sandra ) are rivals for the affections of George Brent ( as Pete ) . The main story , and " The Great Lie " , is that Ms . Astor becomes pregnant and gives the baby to Ms . Davis to raise . After the two women believe Mr . Brent has been killed . Brent turns up alive , and Davis says nothing - - that is " The Great Lie " . There are countless films which depict stereotypes and indicate racism - - this film is one of them . " The Great Lie " is a film with very distracting stereotypical portrayals . It is most distressing to see that Hattie McDaniel is playing essentially the same role in this " modern " story that she played during the Civil War ( in " Gone with the Wind " ) . Otherwise , it's an enjoyable story . Interestingly , Astor more than holds her own against Davis , in her role of concert pianist ; it's also an intriguing characterization . The Great Lie ( 1941 ) Edmund Goulding - Bette Davis , Mary Astor , George Brent
453305	15896852	22286	7.0	James Cagney Makes an Impression	" The Public Enemy " is not a great film , but it features an absolutely incredible performance , by James Cagney . This was Mr . Cagney's first " starring " role ; and he is great throughout . From the time he walks in front of the camera , moving his cap forward , until his final thundering scenes , Cagney is astonishing . The rest of the film is a mixed bag . For starters , filmmakers showed Cagney ( Tom Powers ) and co-star Edward Woods ( Matt Doyle ) as boys Frank Coghlan Jr . ( young Tom Powers ) and Frankie Darro ( young Matt Doyle ) . Although Mr . Woods is directed to wipe his hand with his sleeve when he first appears , it looks like the boys ' roles are mixed up with the adult men - - Mr . Coghlan Jr . ( a fine performance , by the way ) resembles Woods more than Cagney ; and , Mr . Darro more closely resembles Cagney . The appearance of the boys ' sister and brother ( " sissy " Mike ) is also confusing . Of all the strange supporting performances , Jean Harlow ( as Gwen ) takes the cake ( but not the grapefruit ) . Though second billed , she enters the story late , and leaves abruptly . Ms . Harlow was , like Cagney , on her way to major stardom ; but , unlike Cagney , she shows relatively little of her later charms . In fact , Joan Blondell is much more memorable ( as Mamie , Matt's girl ) . And , famously , Mae Clarke receives the halved grapefruit , in the face , from Cagney ; it's still a great scene , but " The Public Enemy " has much better scenes - - Cagney's visit to the tailor , his walk in the rain , and the film's ending are all superior to the " grapefruit scene " . Watch out for Cagney .
453101	15896852	25681	7.0	Fairbanks Goes Out in Style	Legendary lover Douglas Fairbanks ( as Don Juan ) feels the fatigue of advancing years ; so , the ageing lady-killer takes advantage of a misunderstanding , and fakes his own death . After a rest , Mr . Fairbanks tries to return to his amorous ways ; but , nobody believes he's the real Don Juan . Through it all , Fairbanks fans both new ( Merle Oberon as Antonita ) and old ( Benita Hume as Dona Dolores ) flames . A look at the credits of " The Private Life of Henry VIII " ( 1933 ) will reveal what filmmaker Alexander Korda had in mind - - obviously , with " Don Juan " , he hoped to duplicate the success of the earlier " Henry VIII " . Unfortunately , this similarly staged " Private Life " found itself coming up short , and is significantly more lowly regarded . Indeed , it is a flat film . Moreover , the supporting cast is introduced in a confusing manner ; it's difficult to keep track of who's who . In his last film role , Fairbanks is terrific as an ageing " Don Juan " . Interestingly , he succeeds in eliciting the feeling he memorably portrayed " Don Juan " sometime during his 1920s box office reign . Not so , the famed womanizer was played , in fact , by John Barrymore ; and , in spirit , by Rudolph Valentino . Still , Fairbanks makes the role personal ; undoubtedly , his status as an fading film superstar helped . Fairbanks ' best scene occurs about a half hour in , when he is informed of his character's " death " via the sword of Gibson Gowland ( as Don Alfredo ) . Fairbanks pretends to be his character's mourning steward ; then , he offers some interesting , likely personal , observations on fame . This is followed by a nice funeral sequence , revealing much about the famed lady-killer's escapades . Barry Mackay's deftly inept portrayal as a wannabe Juan is worth noting ; his " inability " to leap effectively contracts Fairbanks ' ageing gracefulness .
452709	15896852	33774	7.0	Van Heflin Tears it Up	Robert Taylor ( as Johnny Eager ) is a racketeer on parole ; he is posing an honest taxi driver , but actually runs a successful criminal organization . His companion is Van Heflin ( as Jeff Hartnett ) , an unrequited love-struck alcoholic . Adversarial district attorney Edward Arnold ( as John Benson Farrell ) has a tempting step-daughter , luscious Lana Turner ( as Liz Bard ) , who complicates life considerably . Mr . Taylor is charismatic as gangster " Johnny Eager " and Ms . Turner is lovely as " Liz " ? Van Heflin ( as Jeff Hartnett ) is the actor and performer to watch in this film . Every time he is on camera , Heflin is riveting - whether in the background , staring into space ; or , when seen in close-up , crying his eyes out . Moreover , he never overplays his hand , or goes " over the top " ; instead , he makes the absolute most out of a delicious role . In an otherwise routine production , Heflin delivers an unfolding , landmark supporting performance . Nothing is quite as good as Heflin's performance in " Johnny Eager " , but Taylor's drunken crashing of the " poker party " makes the second half much more entertaining than the first half of the gangster story . Lana Turner watchers should know her clothing choices get sexier during the film's running time . Still , keep an eye on Heflin's " Jeff " - by the end of the film , he is unquestionably Taylor's " leading man " . Johnny Eager ( 1942 ) Mervyn LeRoy - Robert Taylor , Van Heflin , Lana Turner
452978	15896852	269095	7.0	Fatherhood	Homicide detective Robert De Niro ( as Vincent LaMarca ) has a skeleton in his closet . Mr . De Niro's father was executed as a baby killer . However , De Niro " turned his life around " and , with help from a law-abiding father figure , became a respectable police officer . Unfortunately , he left his wife and young son on the wrong side of the tracks . Fourteen years later , De Niro's handsome son James Franco ( as Joey LaMarca ) has become a gaunt Long Beach junkie , with a neglected son of his own . While scoring some junk , Mr . Franco knifes a dealer , in self-defense ( this is the film's opening ) . Then , father De Niro is assigned the task of bringing in his estranged son as a murderer . If you give " City by the Sea " a chance , it should make a good impression , thanks to the skillfully focused cast and crew . De Niro is particularly good at elevating the story ; he keeps everything real . The story is , otherwise , not structurally sound . To give an example ( without giving anything away ) note that Franco's opening " killing " is hardly a crime . Wouldn't the film's theme have worked better if this was a real , however warranted , passionate murder ? This would strengthen the sense of loss / salvation expressed by De Niro and Franco in the final act . There are other puzzling story developments , right up until the final " beach " visit . Director Michael Caton-Jones ' near-ending " auto body shop " segment is exciting , though . City by the Sea ( 2002 ) Michael Caton-Jones - Robert De Niro , James Franco , Frances McDormand
453341	15896852	14605	7.0	A Hard Habit to Break	In Italy , the Lordly volcano Vesuvius " waves his plume of peace to a smiling city in the valley " . Of course , the volcano is , in actuality , " a seething ferment of unrest . " The city is equally dominated by the wealthy Chiaromonte family , who live in a monstrous palace . Among them are half-sisters Lillian Gish ( as Angela ) and Gail Kane ( as Marchesa ) . Ms . Gish is in love with young Ronald Colman ( as Govanni Severini ) ; and , they plan to marry . The sisters ' father Charles Lane ( as Prince Chiaromonte ) , when not focusing on his devotionals , likes to ride horses ; unfortunately , he falls off his horse , and dies . Wicked sister Kane destroys the Prince's will ; and , in the eyes of The Law and The Church , inherits everything . Bad becomes worse when the Catholic church refuses to recognize the deceased Prince's second marriage , which produced Gish ; so the wedding with Colman becomes a not-so-blessed event . Finally , Kane throws Gish out of the palace . Later , poverty-stricken Gish is reunited with her beloved Captain Colman . They plan to wed when he returns from a mission to Africa ; but , he is reportedly killed , fighting Arab bandits . Then , Gish becomes a nun . When her more earthly intended turns up alive , Gish must choose between her spiritual husband , Jesus Christ , and the physical Ronald Colman ? Way too long , and directorially unfocused , Henry King's " The White Sister " does not reach its lofty expectations . There are , however , some extraordinarily beautiful scenes ; and , the lead performances are excellent . The film seems relatively " reverential " , considering the subject matter ; though , Colman rails against , " The tyranny of the church - - enslaving women who should be wives and mothers ! " Undoubtedly , Gish and King were familiar with the original portrayal of " The White Sister " , by Viola Allen , on stage ( 1909 ) and screen ( 1915 ) , and sought to bring the story to more " epic " proportions . It appears as if water replaced the more difficult to film lava , for the less-than-climatic finish .
452374	15896852	37614	7.0	Bette Davis Harvests John Dall	English spinster teacher Bette Davis ( as Lilly Moffat ) arrives to open a school in a Welsh coal-mining village ; she meets opposition from backwards-thinking locals like Nigel Bruce ( as Squire ) , but perseveres . Ms . Davis ' efforts are rewarded as pupil John Dall ( as Morgan Evans ) shows great academic promise . Davis thinks Mr . Dall has what it takes to attend Oxford University . But , breaking Dall free of his socio-economic status proves to be especially difficult , after he has a child-producing dalliance with seductive Joan Lorring ( as Bessie Watty ) . Emlyn Williams ' play " The Corn Is Green " makes an oddly impassionate translation to film ; however , its mannered performances are notable . Perhaps inadvertently , Davis and Dall help by giving the impression something forbidden is simmering beneath the surface of their scripted relationship . An increase in sexual tension would have made the story more interesting . The Corn Is Green ( 1945 ) Irving Rapper - Bette Davis , John Dall , Joan Lorring
452535	15896852	76786	7.0	Dancing with the Stars	American ballet student Jessica Harper ( as Suzy Banyon ) goes to study at a European dance academy , where grizzly murders and hungry maggots reign supreme . " The Tanz Academy " is fronted by elegant Joan Bennett ( as Madame Blanc ) , with stern Alida Valli ( Miss Tanner ) well-suited , as head teacher . Chief among the young leotard set is Ms . Harper's relatively long-lived pal , lovely Stefania Casini ( as Sara ) . As hair-raising events continue , Harper begins to suspect a coven of witches may have infested the dance Academy . The storytelling part of " Suspiria " is relatively weak , with events unintentionally serving to lesson the dramatic impact of the horror . The superb opening scenes , for example , are never really improved upon . Interesting characters are underdeveloped , and should have been more cleverly woven into the plot . Despite its haphazard script , and some obvious budget restraints , director Dario Argento's " Suspiria " remains an excellent film . Mr . Argento's innovative , imaginative direction is the film's greatest strength . His cutting edge camera sense is often striking ; and , the color photography , with Luciano Tovoli , is illuminating . The sharp soundtrack music , by the appropriately named " Goblin " band , is reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's " Tubular Bells " . Ms . Bennett and Ms . Valli are a treat . The usually underutilized Bennett is especially noteworthy , in her only post - " Dark Shadows " feature film appearance . Bennett accepted the project on the strength of the director's reputation , and a chance to visit Rome . When " Suspiria " appeared in the USA , she received some unwarranted poor notices , and professed dissatisfaction with the film's violent content . Still , Bennett was " Saturn Award " - nominated as 1978's " Best Supporting Actress " for her work . Bennett duplicitously gives the " Madame Blanc " character just the right amount of respectability , or " class " ; she keeps her Academy dancers enrolled , and helps hold the slim story together .

452414	15896852	20298	7.0	Stroheim's Swansong	In an ancient European kingdom , sultry Seena Owen ( as Queen Regina V ) lounges , awaiting her nuptials with dashing Walter Byron ( as Prince Wolfram ) . Nearby , convent girl Gloria Swanson ( as Patricia Kelly ) encourages the Lord's wrath by sleeping with her photographs of the handsome Mr . Byron . While he is out riding one day , Ms . Swanson gets a chance to meet the idolized Prince , and embarrassingly loses her knickers ! For Swanson and Byron , it's love at first sight . But , how can a simple convent girl get the Queen's stud ? Director Erich von Stroheim and actress Gloria Swanson , with their skills in full tilt excess , are a joy to behold . Yet , " Queen Kelly " emerges as a fairly strong film , despite its self-indulgence . Once considered a hopelessly unfinished work ; the film has been restored , with great integrity , through intertitles , stills , and imagination . There is no doubt Swanson would have played the final reels expertly ; but , there is no way to tell if Stroheim and Swanson would have re-shot some of her opening footage . Few convent girls looked as gorgeous as Gloria Swanson , with her amplified eyelashes . Though she isn't the first ( or last ) Hollywood convent inhabitant to look so ravishing , it would have been wise to tone down the look , until later in the film . Flaws notwithstanding , " Queen Kelly " is full of great stuff . Tobacco-stained Tully Marshall ( as Jan Vryheid ) and whip-wielding Ms . Owen are delightfully outrageous . Byron , pocketing her knickers , is a thoroughly charming partner for Swanson . Stroheim , and photographers Gordon Pollock and Paul Ivano , are outstanding ; a simple scene of Swanson praying , with candles dripping around her , is beautiful . Ah , they had faces then ?
453077	15896852	12364	7.0	A Happy New Year for Victor Sjöström	Once upon a time , in Sweden , there was a poor Salvation Army sister . At death's door , she requests , " Send for David Holm ! " But , Victor Sjöström ( as David Holm ) cannot be located , because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard , with his drinking buddies . Dying Sister Astrid Holm ( as Edit ) wants to see if praying for Mr . Sjöström's soul , over the past year , has produced any results ; arguably , it has not . In the graveyard , Sjöström tells the story of " The Phantom Carriage " , which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg ( as Georges ) . According to legend , the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people , until being relieved next New Year's Eve . . . Director Sjöström , whose lead performance is very strong , combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film . The great " double exposure " effect is used frequently , but never seems overdone ; and , it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable ( for example , Sjöström's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door ) . A Selma Lagerlöf story probably wasn't one you could , or would want to , tamper with in the 1920s - which may , or may not be , why the ending of this film is a letdown . And , unlike similar spiritual stories , it's difficult to suspend your disbelief , if you think too carefully about what is really happening in " Körkarlen " .

453336	15896852	29844	7.0	Tears Along the Mississippi	Mark Twain's classic characters are brought back to life , by David O . Selznick , for an updated movie adaptation . For the first time , Tom and Huck are seen in color ( specifically , " Technicolor " ) , which contributes to the film's main strength : it looks storybook beautiful . The reliance on set pieces seems entirely appropriate , giving the film great style ; and , they are very well done . The cinematography , by James Wong Howe , is remarkable . The story wavers from true triumph , however , in the direction of the characters ; the " cuteness quotient " is set far too high . Many tears flow . Tommy Kelly ( as Tom Sawyer ) suffers the most , of course , being the lead player . It should be emphasized , however , that this is not due to his effort ; under the circumstances , Mr . Kelly performs well . Jackie Moran ( as Huckleberry Finn ) is a cute best friend ; but , not much like the " Huck " from Twain's book . Ann Gillis ( as Becky Thatcher ) is a cute girl friend . The players are all good , but May Robson ( as Aunt Polly ) seems the truest . While more cute than mischievous , and far too clean , " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " is good enough to stand on its own . The familiar " lost in the caves " ending is a great climax ; and , Victor Jory ( as Injun Joe ) still startles . The scene of " Tom " emerging , at last , from the caves - - his black silhouette shot against the blue sky of freedom - - is indelible .

453135	15896852	31867	7.0	The James Cagney Movie Formula Before the Fall	After " The Great War " ends , G . I . James Cagney ( as Eddie Bartlett ) returns home from France . He expects to return to his old job as an automobile mechanic ; however , the boss breaks a promise , and turns Mr . Cagney away . In fact , the United States is descending into economic turmoil , which will end with " The Great Depression " . Unable to make an honest living , Cagney drifts into profitable " Prohibition " - era bootlegging . Valiant speakeasy hostess Gladys George ( as Panama Smith ) pines for Cagney , but he only has eyes for sweet Priscilla Lane ( as Jean Sherman ) . As the years roll along , Cagney's trusted lawyer Jeffrey Lynn ( as Lloyd Hart ) falls in love with pretty Ms . Lane ? Warner Brothers seems to have pulled out all the stops for " The Roaring Twenties " . Cagney , who had reached an extraordinary peak with the recently released gem " Angels with Dirty Faces " , is a marvel to watch , from beginning to end . Interestingly , after this film , Cagney sought to stop to his " gangster " image , until " White Heat " ( another gem , from 1949 ) . But , here , Cagney is still the victim of circumstances ; note , he does not become a criminal due to his nature . In this film , Cagney is another " Angel " , with a environmentally influenced " dirty face " . . . " The Roaring Twenties " is , also , about relationships ; or , to be more specific , it's about unexciting relationships . The only believable passion Cagney's character has is for best pal Frank McHugh ( as Danny Green ) , who needed some more expository scenes . The one that got away , Ms . George makes the most of a poorly scripted relationship between her character and " Eddie " - this is the pairing the film really serves up short shrift . The production is " top of the line , " , but the story is neither as strong , nor as artfully told as its studio's other " gangster " movies . Still , a star like Cagney , supporting players like Humphrey Bogart , and bit players down to Maurice Costello , make " The Roaring Twenties " purr .

453328	15896852	65856	7.0	Come See the Dark Shadows Vampires Do It	This is an excellent , flawed film spin-off of the classic TV serial " Dark Shadows " . It captures Jonathan Frid , Joan Bennett , Grayson Hall and many of the cast on film , in character , during the time of the original Dark Shadows-mania . For that , we should be eternally grateful . Other favorites David Selby , Kate Jackson , and Lara Parker can be found in the next Dark Shadows movie . What keeps this movie from becoming truly exceptional is that it overindulges . The thing you expect too happen in a vampire horror story happens over and over AND OVER again , to seemingly every character . It's all very stylish and well-done - but , it's OVERKILL . The production , by Dan Curtis is marvelous , but he takes the characters too , too far away from their television characterizations ; at times , they seem like strangers . If considered another in the band of Dark Shadows ' " Parallel Time " , it works . It's a surprise Dick Smith's make-up and Bob Cobert's music weren't Oscar-nominated .

453653	15896852	64886	7.0	Risky Mississippi Business	" Oh , Reivers ? that's an old-fashioned word from my childhood , " explains narrator Burgess Meredith , " In plain English , I'm afraid it meant ? thieves ! " The narrator is fondly recalling an adventure he had as an 11-year-old boy , " coming of age " in Mississippi . Young Mitch Vogel ( as Lucius Priest ) is the lad ; he accompanies father-figure / handyman Steve McQueen ( as Boon Hogganbeck ) , who steals the family's first automobile - a brand new , yellow-colored 1905 Winton Flyer . Rupert Crosse ( as Ned McCaslin ) makes " The Reivers " a trio by stowing away in the car's trunk . Their main destination is a bordello , where Mr . McQueen wants to hook up with prostitute girlfriend Sharon Farrell ( as Corrie ) . Meanwhile , Mr . Crosse swaps the trio's prized vehicle for a slow horse named " Lightning " ? Mark Rydell's direction of William Faulkner's final novel is a qualified success . The principal cast members work very well together , with Vogel and Crosse exhibiting as much star presence as the more famous McQueen . The supporting cast is great ; the participation of Will Geer , Burgess Meredith , and Juano Hernandez add to the film's old-world charm . Richard Moore's Mississippi photography is beautiful . Although it doesn't ever go quite far enough , " The Reivers " main strength is in its depiction of real , flawed characters . Faulkner's portrayal of race and gender , as much as they show , are noteworthy . The most touching moments occur when young Vogel learns that women are not viewed the same way , after adolescence . His obvious difficulty accepting the degradation of women ( through prostitution and beating ) portends a different future for the younger generation .

452761	15896852	8499	7.0	Lost Little Girl	After her mother mortgages the family's " Sunnybrook Farm " , Mary Pickford ( as Rebecca Randall ) is sent to live with two aunts : Josephine Crowell ( as Aunt Miranda ) is stern and heartless ; she overrides kinder , broken-hearted , Mayme Kelso ( as Aunt Jane ) . Predictably , Ms . Pickford finds things are not so sunny in Riverboro . Moreover , she finds her self at odds with teasing peers , like Violet Wilkey ( as Minnie Smellie ) . Pickford perseveres . And , eventually , she warms folks up , like her older man crush Eugene O'Brien ( as Adam " Mr . Aladdin " Ladd ) , who Pickford hopes to marry when she " grows up " ? In a first class production , Pickford has some nice moments ; though , her affected " little girl " persona doesn't really succeed in effectively portraying the young heroine of Kate Douglas Wiggins ' " Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm " , as evidenced on film . In sometimes startling contrast , several of the other young performers are noticeably more natural and / or charming . Ms . Wilkey , one of the younger set , regrettably " retired " shortly after her convincing portrayal of " Minnie Smellie " . Wilkey , who also played young " Flora " in " The Birth of a Nation " ( 1915 ) , was one of many marvelous young players Pickford employed , to shine by her side . Happily , kids like Wesley Barry and Milton Berle did not retire after appearing herein . Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm ( 1917 ) Marshall Neilan - Mary Pickford , Eugene O'Brien , Violet Wilkey
452829	15896852	55230	7.0	Curtis Harrington outfits Dennis Hopper	Lonely , young sailor Dennis Hopper ( as Johnny Drake ) enters a seaside California tavern and spies exotic , forlorn beauty Linda Lawson ( as Mora ) . Smitten , Mr . Hopper walks her home , but receives only an invitation to breakfast , the next day . The next morning , Hopper shares a breakfast of mackerel with Ms . Lawson ( and a seagull ) . Lawson explains she works as a mermaid for the local carnival . Hopper begins a relationship with the strange woman , who implies she may be descended from real mermaids . Then , he learns her previous boyfriends died mysteriously ? Curtis Harrington's " Night Tide " is absorbing , atmospheric , and hypnotic . Director Harrington and star Hopper are perfectly suited to each other , focusing on Hopper's achingly natural , and almost impossibly poignant , characterization . The photography ( Vilis Lapenieks ) and music ( David Raksin ) are also in tune . Lawson is magnetic and mysterious . Shakespearean reader Gavin Muir ( as Samuel Murdock ) and coffee-loving Luana Anders ( as Ellen Sands ) join in the struggle for Hopper's mind and body . If only there were a couple of re-takes , another edit , and a clearer resolution ? Night Tide ( 1961 ) Curtis Harrington - Dennis Hopper , Linda Lawson , Gavin Muir
452412	15896852	10662	7.0	Griffith Goes West	Subtitled " A Tale of the Old West , " director D . W . Griffith promises , " This story corroborates the old saying that truth is stranger than fiction - incidents being taken from actual episodes of those stirring days . " He means those western gold-fevered days in California , circa 1849 . Mr . Griffith ( with assistance from Elmer Clifton ) brings " Scarlet Days " to the expected climactic chase and rescue sequence , in a western setting . It's an excellent picture , overall , though obviously lesser than other Griffith films in release at the time . " Scarlet Days " joined " Broken Blossoms " ( at # 1 ) , " The Girl Who Stayed at Home " , and " True Heart Susie " in " The New York Times " ten best films of the year 1919 list . The main story involves " lonely , little " Carol Dempster ( as " Lady Fair " ) arriving in California to look for her long-absent mother , after the death of her aunt . In the west , Ms . Dempster's mother , Eugenie Besserer ( as " Rosy Nell " ) , has become an embarrassed dance-hall hostess , in order to save money for Dempster's education and dowry ( presumably ) . Upon arriving , irresistible Dempster attracts male attention from darkly handsome Richard Barthelmess ( as Don Maria Alvarez , " The Wandering Knight " ) , fair young hunk Ralph Graves ( as John Randolph , " Sir Whiteheart " ) , and lustful sleaze Walter Long ( as King Bagley , " Knight of the Black Stain " ) . At one point , Mr . Long forces Mr . Graves to watch him attempt raping Dempster . Another Griffith regular , Clarine Seymour ( as Chiquita , " Little Flameheart " ) , has a relatively satisfying role , as the piteous maiden who pines for Mr . Barthelmess . A Griffith regular and promising actress , Ms . Seymour died too soon , after one more film ( " The Idol Dancer " ) . Barthelmess and Graves do well , individually ; but , are a visual mismatch when sharing the screen . Gangly and eye-rolling , Dempster is unconvincing and miscast as the comely maiden . Ms . Besserer's " stained soul " portrayal of her mother is the stand-out performance . Scarlet Days ( / 19 ) D . W . Griffith - Richard Barthelmess , Carol Dempster , Eugenie Besserer
453126	15896852	39694	7.0	Garbo's Back ! ( and Hitchcock's Scratching It )	In London , attractive widow Alida Valli ( as Maddalena Anna Paradine ) is arrested for the poisoning murder of her blind , wealthy husband . Most sympathies lie with the well-respected Ms . Valli ; and , family friend Charles Coburn ( as Simon Flaquer ) arranges for dashing defense attorney Gregory Peck ( as Anthony " Tony " Keane ) to prove her not guilty . Mr . Peck's wife , Ann Todd ( as Gay Keane ) , thinks Valli is innocent ; though , she senses Peck is falling in love with the accused woman . Peck's investigation leads him to handsome Paradine valet Louis Jourdan ( as André Latour ) . Exceptionally well-produced ( David O . Selznick ) and directed ( Alfred Hitchcock ) ; but , the story is far too slow and oblique to engage as it should . No doubt , Greta Garbo would have added greater depth and beauty to the role of " Mrs . Paradine " ; Ms . Garbo turned down the role because she no longer wanted to play this type of character . Foolishly , the filmmakers neglected to offer her the part played by Ann Todd . Todd certainly gets the award for " Best Garbo Performance " in this film ; and her looks approximate Garbo's , in 1947 . Interestingly , Hitchcock stylistically directs Valli as " Mata Hari " , and Todd as " Ninotchka " . Nevertheless , the " two new Selznick stars " , Jourdan and Valli , are very impressive in their roles . Jourdan is particularly effective ; his character is likely bisexual , as subtly noted in the script ( and , on screen , flirting with the coachman ) . The judge assigned to the case is Charles Laughton ( as Thomas Horfield ) ; however , his character's lecherous nature is only rather fleetingly played with . Ethel Barrymore ( as Sophie Horfield ) is a welcome supporting player . And , Lee Garmes ' photography is outstanding .

452629	15896852	104753	7.0	A Stardust Melody ? ( the Memory of Love's Refrain )	Almost any scene of this film , shown in isolation , would suggest it is a masterpiece . But , the entire movie is setting - - a story never really happens . Director Terrance Davies , cinematographer Michael Coulter , and actor Leigh McCormack create very beautiful , sad world for a sensitive boy named Bud . The film is flawless , but don't expect a traditional film plot . " The Long Day Closes " is like watching a piece of art ; sometimes the camera lingers over images so long , it's like you're looking at a still picture . Watching the film , in one sitting , I thought the " Tammy " part was a highlight - - it had me guessing about where " Bud " was : church , school ? It also moved the setting up to 1957 ( I looked up the Debbie Reynolds movie ) ; earlier , I thought the film might take place in the 1940s . Marjorie Yates and the supporting cast were wonderful . The " crucifixion " scene was most startling ; it suggests Christianity may have inflicted more harm than good , on this family . Still , nothing really happened to get me interested what was going on , in the story , I am only a child , myself . I will , absolutely watch for the name Terence Davies , and look for his other work ; he is a phenomenal filmmaker , obviously .
452974	15896852	20458	7.0	Lovable and Sweet	Hungarian blonde Betty Compson ( as Frederika " Freddie " Joyzelle ) gets fired from her job as a New York waitress , for breaking a dish over her boss ' head . Although the film is suggestively titled " Street Girl " , Ms . Compson avoids dabbling in the world's oldest profession . Instead , Compson hooks up with attractive John Harron ( as Mike Fall ) , who is so taken with briefly homeless Compson , he asks her to move in with his jazzy musical group . As " The Four Seasons " , Mr . Harron's " Mike Fall " is teamed with Jack Oakie ( as Joe Spring ) , Ned Sparks ( as Happy Winter ) , and Guy Buccola ( as Pete Summer ) . Compson , conveniently a violinist , joins " The Four Seasons " both at home and on stage . The group is lively and likable ; especially , the smiling Mr . Oakie , in his spring . The " Seasons " become successful , and romance blooms for Compson and Harron ; but , a visiting Prince threatens the duo's happiness . . . Compson , who was at an artistic peak around the time silent films found their voice , tends to be a little too theatrical in " Street Girl " , her starring vehicle ; she certainly proves her versatility on the screen , however . Leading man Harron gives director / co-producer Wesley Ruggles the film's best acting performance ; he ( perhaps unfairly ) certainly makes you wonder what heights deceased brother Bobby Harron might have reached in the " talkies " . The early Oscar Levant music ( with lyrics by Sidney Clare ) is very good . Gus Arnheim " and His Coconut Grove Ambassadors " skillfully dubbed their instrumentals ; apparently , this is before future star Fred MacMurray joined the group . The frequently heard " Loveable and Sweet " is considered a jazz classic , in the cover version expertly recorded by Annette Hanshaw with the Dorsey Brothers . Although the early " RKO Radio Picture " production is more than a little rough around the edges , the musical / comedy genre storyline is solid .

452971	15896852	24264	7.0	Litttle Big Women	The film might be more accurately titled " Little Woman " , with Katherine Hepburn seizing the lead role , and never letting go . Otherwise , it's the story of four " Little Women " growing up , and finding love's direction . Hepburn ( she's Jo ) is sister to Joan Bennett ( she's Amy ) , Jean Parker ( she's Beth ) , and Frances Dee ( she's Meg ) . Of their suitors , Douglass Montgomery ( he's Laurie ) gets the most action . Ms . Bennett steals the actual acting honors with a performance that is natural and consistent ; her voice and mannerisms are appropriately girlish , young womanish ? and , selfish . Ms . Hepburn plays girlish like she's had too many cups of coffee ; additionally , she never looks even remotely " tomboyish " ; looking , instead , like a ravishingly made-up MGM movie star . Ms . Parker rises out of her sick bed like a zombie , but is okay in other scenes . Watching Hepburn being romanced by Mr . Montgomery and Paul Lukas is unnerving . The story does have some reasons to watch , however . The production is obviously top-of-the-line . Hepburn may not be in her best role , but it's not awful ; she slows down and gets better after her character grows older . The script has well-written characters - Jo , Amy , and Laurie - who illustrate a sweet story of family , love , and friendship .

452596	15896852	33428	7.0	Blitzkrieg Bop	This sixth " East Side Kids " film is one of the better Bowery boy adventures . During this era , the movies focused on the characters played by Leo Gorcey ( as Muggs ) and Bobby Jordan ( as Danny ) . Usually , Mr . Jordan and an adult relative provided the storyline , for leader Gorcey and the lads . Criminal activity and reform school were a part of many plots . " Bowery Blitzkrieg " has all the elements which were , obviously , very popular with young audiences ( or , the wouldn't have made so many of these films ) . The storyline is a " Bowery Blitzkrieg " . Apparently , Gorcey and Jordan have taken up boxing ( wouldn't you know it ? ) . It's clear from shirtless Jordan's opening workout ( cut from some versions of this film ) that hunky Jordan is the gang's choice for champ . Instead , Jordan decides to pursue an education . Probably , this put a strain on the otherwise tight Gorcey / Jordan ( Muggs / Danny ) relationship . This would help explain some , but not all , of the ensuing contrived , continuity-starved events . . . Jordan meets sleazy , seductive Bobby Stone ( as Monk Martin ) , and is sucked into becoming the driver for Mr . Stone's petty thievery . Stone drives a wedge between Jordan and " The East Side Kids " by telling him that Gorcey has been talking dirty about Jordan's sister , Charlotte Henry ( as Mary Breslin ) and her " copper " fiancé . At the local pool hall , Jordan gets the best of his old pal , which helps land Gorcey in reform school . After becoming chummy with law enforcement , Gorcey is paroled , by Jordan's sister's policeman boyfriend , Warren Hull ( as Tom Brady ) . Officer Hull wants Gorcey to become law enforcement's champion boxer . Gorcey is a success at boxing , but draws criminal interest ; and , he is paid to throw an upcoming " big fight " . Meanwhile , Jordan continues to drive the getaway car for more of Stone's robberies . On the eve of the " big fight " , policeman Hull catches up with Jordan and Stone ; then , a dramatic shoot-out connects Gorcey and Jordan in life-or-death struggles ? Jordan and Gorcey do very well with the script ( and they can still pass for reform school age delinquents ) . Future regular Stone has one of his best " Bowery " roles ; he and Jordan have an unusual ( gay ? ) relationship , and their dramatic shoot-out is surprisingly well done ( by director Wallace Fox ) , for the series ' budget . Former " Dead End " kid Huntz Hall joins the " East Side " cast , happily ; he's an amusingly thirsty ringside trainer . And , intelligent Ernest Morrison's " Scruno " has a great " against type " bit . Watch for some of the cast's better Bowery moments . Bowery Blitzkrieg ( / 41 ) Wallace Fox - Bobby Jordan , Leo Gorcey , Bobby Stone

She asked her chauffeur to take her for a ride . When they are caught returning from a rendezvous , the chauffeur is fired ; then , he commits suicide . Somewhat disenchanted , Garbo takes off with exciting Nils Asther for a long romantic trip aboard his ship - the " All Alone " . Garbo wants to marry , but Asther must travel to China . Back home , Garbo is romanced by , and does marry , millionaire Johnny Mack Brown . Later , Asther returns ? Garbo loves Asther , but is married ( with child ) to Mack Brown . What will she do ? " The Single Standard " is beautifully photographed and silently performed . The subject matter must have been considered daring at the time . Today , it's fairly standard stuff . Still - Garbo , the photography , and briefly twisted ending make it look like magic . The Single Standard ( 1929 ) John S . Robertson - Greta Garbo , Nils Asther , Johnny Mack Brown
453699	15896852	375679	7.0	Los Angeles Smacked Upside the Face	Paul Haggis ' " Crash " is an insulting picture . It seeks to say something meaningful about racism run rampant in Los Angeles . Did somebody put something in the water ? Something that only a Los Angeles snowfall could wipe away ? Nearly every character in the film is motivated by ignorant , bigoted instincts . Things get started with a car crash and a carjacking - with people of different ethnic groups colliding ? get it ? The first real grabber occurs when two carjackers ( Ludacris & Larenz Tate ) draw guns and jack a car - not very shocking , but these two don't impress you as carjackers ? which could be part of the point , or not . . . A more shocking scene has two policeman ( Matt Dillon & Ryan Phillippe ) pulling over a couple for lollipopping in their automobile . The wife ( Thandie Newton ) who " went down " is roughly " felt up " by the abusive cop ( Dillon ) , while her husband ( Terrence Howard ) is forced to watch on , apologetically . Later , the abusive cop is offered " salvation " , in a laughably conceived scene . Elsewhere , a snooty ( Sandra Bullock ) socialite finds friendship and redemption in the arms of her housekeeper . A small businessman ( Shaun Toub ) man feels supernatural forces " saved " him from shooting a little girl dead . One of the carjackers becomes a martyr . . . The only character with a story worth telling is the locksmith ( Michael Peña ) seeking a better life for his family ; although , you can make out three or four good stories buried in the mix . The film has no focal character ( it should have been the role played by Don Cheadle ) . It is obvious and lacking humor . And , its overdriven theme is outmoded and unfair . " Crash " drives a stake through its own heart by failing to realize its story is primarily about social and cultural class , rather than the loathsome thing hoisted up on the screen . So , why a relatively high ranking ? The production , direction ( Haggis ) , photography ( J . Michael Muro ) , and performances are often excellent .

453122	15896852	43067	7.0	Robert Newton Shivers Me Timbers	Robert Louis Stevenson's exciting classic is brought back to life , more or less , as a Walt Disney Production . With those limitations in mind , this " Treasure Island " is , still , quite entertaining . While it's much more light and cheery than the original work , it's also filled with more bloody violence than you'd expect from the Disney studio at that time - - if you're seeing the ( recommended ) uncut version . Bobby Driscoll is an engaging Jim Hawkins ; his gun-wielding offing of pirate Geoffrey Keen ( as Israel Hands ) is an exciting highlight . Some of the pirates are more annoying than terrifying ; and , only a Disney pirate could have such perfectly shiny white teeth ; but , they do grown on you . Robert Newton's snarling " Long John Silver " is an especially memorable portrayal . Mr . Newton's shivering " Arrggggg ! " portrayal is classic ; it has , deservedly , outlived the film .

Consequently , young Rettig has bad daydreams , especially during practice sessions with priggish piano man Hans Conried ( as Dr . Terwilliker ) . Rettig tells his instructor , " I don't think the piano's my instrument . " Obviously , Rettig should be out playing baseball . The boy also believes the dictatorial Mr . Conried may have mother Mary Healy ( as Heloise Collins ) under some sort of spell - and , may even be planning to marry her , thus replacing Rettig's deceased father . Rettig would rather have his mother marry the plumber , Peter Lind Hayes ( as August Zabladowski ) . Director Roy Rowland and the Stanley Kramer production team keep things interesting , as they plunge Rettig into a nightmarish fantasy world . The film's garish , colorful sets and costumes are very nicely done - and they are imaginatively connected to Rettig's hopes and fears . The influence of writer Dr . Seuss is everywhere ; it's too bad the film was not a hit , since Seuss ' material works well in the live action format . Rettig is able to carry the film , with an endearing , sincere performance ; he is directed well , and happily refuses to be cloying . Conried's character is more cross ( and " daffy " ) than menacing ; he is a delightful entertainer - yet , there is no deep emotional connection to his " Dr . Terwilliker " . He is detestable simply for being a piano taskmaster . The film's other characters are rather bland . The musical score is great , but the soundtrack lacks strong individual songs . This film might have helped Rettig win his role as " Jeff " on " Lassie " , a part he played superbly , until giving the collie to Jon Provost's " Timmy " ( one of 1950s television's most memorable moments ) . The immediate popular and critical success made Rettig one of TV's earliest superstars . And , Conried's Terwilliker may have been a precursor for his semi-regular role of " Uncle Tonoose " on " Make Room for Daddy " - " et cetera ! et cetera ! . . . et cetera !

453528	15896852	55100	7.0	Rock & Doris & Tony & Vip	Rock Hudson , Doris Day , and Tony Randall are excellent - the movie is not so much . First of all , the film is a one of those sophisticated ( ? ) ' 60s " sex comedies " . There are suggested sexual situations throughout : Mr . Hudson is , I believe , fairly explicitly stated as a promiscuous man ; and , Ms . Day makes a conscious decision to have out-of-wedlock sex with Hudson . Also , there are " gay jokes " ; and , there are suggestions of marijuana use ( note the scene where Hudson explains away an uncomfortable situation by saying he smoked a funny cigarette , lacking a label ) . The advertising industry is effectively satirized . The VIP storyline is funny . The scenes between Hudson / Day and Hudson / Randall are witty and well-played . I liked Hudson and Randall with their beards . You'll get to see Hudson in his underwear ( boxers ) and Day in a bathing suit ( one-piece , alas ) . BUT , the script is filled with tired old jokes . The ending is too rushed . I was VERY distracted by the blurring of Doris Day's close-ups in this film . The other performers have very clear close-ups . I would rather they not blur Ms . Day's close-ups , or just blur everyone . I suppose this is a feature of several of Day's sixties films - it's unfortunate .

453681	15896852	18179	7.0	Chaney Takes the Slow Boat to China	Ancient Chinese custom gets the best of star Lon Chaney in this re-make of 1919's melodramatic " Mr . Wu " . Mr . Chaney portrays both Mr . Wu ; and , in an extended prologue , he's Mr . Wu's grandfather . Chaney is , as ever , wildly entertaining . The film is well-produced , with beautiful photography and sets ; with , for its time , a starry supporting cast . The main story doesn't get started until Chaney struts his oriental stuff ; it involves daughter Renée Adorée ( as Nang Ping ) having an out-of-her-race affair with Englishman Ralph Forbes ( as Basil Gregory ) . Mr . Forbes plays the Englishman enchanted by a lovely " China doll " well . Ms . Adorée is not as convincing in her Asian role ; certainly , supporting player Anna May Wong would have been better cast as Wu's daughter . Louise Dresser ( as Mrs . Gregory ) is quite excellent as Forbes ' mother ; at first , her role seems small - but , keep your eyes on Ms . Dresser , who turns in a great performance without extraordinary make-up ! Chinese culture is not presented very flatteringly , to Western filmgoers , in the end . Chaney ( as Wu ) ' s declaration , " My poor little blossom - broken by an ill West Wind , " evokes D . W . Griffith's superior " Broken Blossoms " ( 1919 ) , which more artfully covered some of the same ground . Mr . Wu ( 1927 ) William Nigh - Lon Chaney , Louise Dresser , Renée Adorée
453308	15896852	40185	7.0	It's Not Easy Being Green	As the film begins , young Dean Stockwell ( as Peter Fry ) is in a police station ; obviously , the adults do not know where he belongs , or why his head is shaved bald . Robert Ryan ( as Dr . Evans ) gets young Stockwell to speak , after giving the hungry boy a hamburger . Stockwell tells his story : he was a war orphan , and was shuffled between relatives ( " I sure lived in a lot of places " ) . Finally , he winds up with Pat O'Brien ( as " Gramps " ) , a vaudeville-type actor . He and Mr . O'Brian form a relatively happy family . However , at school , Stockwell is teased , for being an orphan ; specifically , he is told he resembles an " Unidentified War Orphan " depicted in a poster . That evening , O'Brien comforts Stockwell , and promises the next day will bring hope in the form of a surprise . The surprise is , of course , that Stockwell becomes " The Boy with Green Hair " . This is a very unusual film , particularly for the time period ; it is both thought-provoking , and entertaining . Stockwell and O'Brien are wonderful . " Nature Boy " is a beautiful , and apt , theme song . Stockwell's meeting with the War Poster children is very well done - - still , quiet , and effective . However , the themes of " peace " and " tolerance " could be better connected . And , there are some minor story difficulties ; for example , the milkman couldn't possibly be responsible for the green hair , unless Stockwell is the only milk drinker in town ( stipulating the townspeople , as a whole , are of average intelligence ) . Still , a lovely film about being different , which we all are .
452459	15896852	25316	7.0	What Happened One Night	Well , it's evident why the many attempts to re-capture the spirit of this film have failed . The story really isn't all that good . What works is watching how Clark Gable ( as Peter Warne ) and Claudette Colbert ( as Ellie Andrews ) make the most of the script , with help from director Frank Capra . They play the reluctant lovers quite magically - coming across like a couple of performers having fun with the project . Possibly , the sparring of their characters parallels the two stars discovering their professional " chemistry " . There is a sense of fun ( the script calls it " screwy " ) about the film , thanks to Mr . Capra and his famous stars . Most memorable are the leading couple's " risqué " scenes - Mr . Gable baring his chest when explaining how men undress , and Ms . Colbert lifting her skirt to hitch a ride - they are sexy and tasteful . And , Roscoe Karns ' " Oscar " is worthy . The ability to create " fun " from " dumb " was improved on , in better films - but re-making this rather dated and unappealing story would obviously be futile . You can't re-make Capra , Gable , and Colbert - and that's what happened one night . It Happened One Night ( / 34 ) Frank Capra - Clark Gable , Claudette Colbert , Roscoe Karns
453591	15896852	20919	7.0	Laughing it Up	Winsome graduate William Haines ( as Tom Ward ) comes home , intending to enter the job market , while retaining his college lifestyle . Mr . Haines is accustomed fast cars , frequent parties , and women who don't say " No ! " While seeking employment at " Sutton & Co . " , Haines flips over pretty blonde secretary Leila Hyams ( as Mary Howe ) . But , the otherwise engaged Ms . Hyams wants nothing to do with the graduate . Although " The Girl Said No " , Haines refuses to give up . The Haines formula film , with sound , rang up the cash register for MGM . This film was the most profitable of the 1930 hits which propelled William Haines to the top of the box office charts . For the year 1930 , he was the US # 1 Male " Box Office Star " , according to the industry standard list , complied by Quigley Publications . " The Girl Said No " finds Haines graduating from college at a later age than most ( he's about the same age as Dustin Hoffman in " The Graduate " ) . Haines ' fine voice , comic timing , and physicality make the most of a weak , inappropriate , story . Highlights are Haines ' driving Hyams crazy in his car , especially when she tries to drive away without him ; and , a terrific extended session with Haines posing as Marie Dressler's doctor . Ms . Dressler ( as Hettie Brown ) is hilarious ; and , the two play extremely well together . Polly Moran also appears , as Haines ' loyal housekeeper . Haines and Moran don't have as much to do ; but , the rapport between Haines and both women should have had producers looking for a suitable co-starring vehicle . The other cast members perform well ( and stay out of Haines ' way ) . Haines has some fine moments throughout , and shares a classic scene with Dressler .

452382	15896852	115639	7.0	Tell Them Willie Boy Is Back	Unsuccessful New York pianist Timothy Hutton ( as Willie Conway ) returns to small town Knight's Ridge , Massachusetts . There , Mr . Hutton will attend his high school reunion , and consider both a career change and marriage , to his lawyer girlfriend ( Annabeth Gish ) . Hutton reconnects with childhood buds Matt Dillon ( as Tommy " Birdman " Rowland ) , Michael Rapaport ( as Paul Kirkwood ) , Noah Emmerich ( as Michael " Mo " Morris ) , and Max Perlich ( as Kev ) . Hutton also meets his new neighbor , 13-year-old Natalie Portman ( as Marty ) ; and , the two are mutually attracted . Ted Demme's " Beautiful Girls " is less about the title , and more about four men in the elongated winter of their staggered comings of age . Mr . Emmerich , a father , is the farthest along ; and , Mr . Perlich is still a child . The other three men have more interesting stories . The most intriguing is the touchingly written ( by Scott Rosenberg ) " romance " between Hutton and Ms . Portman . But , the best " story " is the secondary one performed by Mr . Dillon , who must face the fact that he reached his peak of popularity in high school , and will find more happiness being common . Mr . Rapaport's gives the film's most satisfying performance ; it's an even greater achievement , when you consider the stellar cast . It helps that snow-plowing Rapaport seems to be the right age for his part . Like Dillon's " Tommy " , Rapaport's character matures ; although , instead of realizing the " Beautiful Girl " , he favored fantasizing . Rosie O'Donnell's bombastic explanation of the idealized " Penthouse " model is a highlight . The cast may be too star-studded for the film's own good ; which is , perhaps , why some of the film's relationships are not entirely convincing . Still , the direction ( by Ted Demme ) , stories ( Rosenberg ) , and several performances , are excellent . Beautiful Girls ( 1996 ) Ted Demme - Timothy Hutton , Matt Dillon , Michael Rapaport
452790	15896852	16294	7.0	A Story of Past Relations	Joseph Schildkraut as ( Kenneth " Ken " Paulton ) and Jetta Goudal ( as Malena Paulton ) are honeymooning at the Grand Canyon ; but , Ms . Goudal is uninterested in consummating the marriage . This , understandably , frustrates Mr . Schildkraut , who can't explain a worsening pain in his arm . They are acquainted with the William Boyd ( as John " Jack " Moreland ) , a minister , who suggests Schildkraut ask God for relief from the hurt in his arm . Schildkraut prays for three weeks , to no avail . Meanwhile , the Reverend Boyd has met and fallen in love with Vera Reynolds ( as Elizabeth " Bess " Walsingham Tyrell ) , a " very modern young lady " who cools off when she finds out he is a minister . These four players act out their modern problems for about half the film ; THEN , fate arranges for them all to be on a train , bound for San Francisco - THEN , the train spectacularly crashes , head-on , into another train ! As the passengers whirl in the train wreckage , Reynolds is mysteriously transported back to 16th Century England . There , she finds faces which are familiar to her , but their personalities are slightly different - these are the " past lives " of her modern day friends and acquaintances . Reynolds assumes the identity of " Lady Elizabeth Tyrell " . Joseph Schildkraut is " Lord Strangevon " , William Boyd is " Reformado Jack " , and Jetta Goudal is " Black Melena " . By the time of the flashback , the film has shifted to feature Vera Reynolds as the star and protagonist ; earlier , " The Road to Yesterday " was a drama centering on the Paulton newlyweds . During the trip to the past , Reynolds ( and viewers ) discover the origins of mysterious stuff from the present . You'll see some startling events , culminating with a character being burned as a witch ! This is a very unusual film . The only story structure like it ( that I've seen ) is " Dark Shadows " TV flashback of 1967 , detailing Barnabas Collins ' 1700s origin . There is no vampire in " The Road to Yesterday " , but Schildkraut's rape of Goudal looks about the same ( attacked in a darkened room ? ) . Cecil B . DeMille directs some fine performances ; strangely , Reynolds and Boyd outdistance Schildkraut and Goudal as the film progresses . Boyd would later star as " Hopalong Cassidy " . I also enjoyed Reynolds ' less reverend fiancée , Casson Ferguson as " Adrian Thompkyns " ; and , Trixie Friganza as " Aunt Harriet , " who appears as a similar character in the past . Also , Frank Coghlan Jr . is memorable the freckle-faced boy ; he was a very popular child star , and played " Billy Batson " ( Captain Marvel ) during an incredibly long career . More potential is lost than realized in this intriguingly original film , from an older Beulah Marie Dix story - it's disappointing , ultimately , but a fascinating watch - nicely photographed by J . Peverell Marley . With some more work , it might have been one of the better DeMilles ( see " The Cheat " and " The Whispering Chorus " for great DeMilles ) . Note : After the witch is burned at the stake , a fleeting title card flashes - I freeze-framed to see , and it reads , " The Road to Yesterday - End of Part 9 " ; probably , signaling the End of Reel 9 . Also note , in the past , Reynolds character reveals she is from 1926 ; the film was released at the end of 1925 , but DeMille expected most would be watching in 1926 .

453426	15896852	18515	7.0	Lewis of Arabia	William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the " Two Arabian Knights " referred to in the title , humorously . The pair start out as U . S . POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I . Eventually , they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia . While tripping out to the Middle East , they rescue an Arab woman , Mary Astor , who turns out to be a Princess ; and , of course , becomes a romantic interest for the " Two Arabian Knights " . No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms . Astor ! The film is very well photographed and directed ; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets , and stages scenes beautifully . Of the performances , Mr . Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak , trough the film is silent . The story isn't as strong as it could be - there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters ' locale changed . The last looks , exchanged between one of the stars and an extra , is an example of something I didn't understand . Perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time . The film is damaged in several places ; but there is enough preserved , in even these scenes , to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks . Boris Karloff appears as the " Purser " ; watch for his big scene on ship , when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money ( what actually happens is a mystery ) . Early in the film , there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up ( or , thereabouts ) ; they are POWs being herded to the showers . Director Milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect ; this " shower " scene is different in that several of the men don't look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude ?

453020	15896852	46672	7.0	The Undersea World of Jules Verne	While I admit the science fiction and special effects don't hold up expertly ; still , I found the film enjoyable - and , it was above average , all things considered . There are old films which have no " dated special effect " look to them - maybe it helps to be in black and white . The squid isn't that bad , and the other stuff is better . Some of the science fiction / fact considerations were more difficult to fathom . James Mason portrays Captain Nemo very well . Kirk Douglas was startling , at first , but easy to get used to - the one who I had the most difficult time with was Peter Lorre ; sometimes , he seemed to be looking around for a different movie . Finally , " 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea " scores points for being thought-provoking . I imagine the film was mainly seen by children . I wasn't around when this film came out ; but , I hope I would have been stimulated by the characters , especially the contradictory Nemo , as a kid . 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea ( 1954 ) Richard Fleischer - Kirk Douglas , James Mason , Paul Lukas
453195	15896852	564250	7.0	Shelley Fabares and Buzz Martin at Their Best	Pretty , popular Mary ( Shelley Fabares ) thinks she's going to the " Junior Prom " with one of the school's leading football players - left tackle Bobby Burgess ( as Ernie ) or right tackle Tom Brandt ( as Phil ) . Mary prefers Mr . Burgess , due to his " cute smile " , but must string Mr . Brandt along while waiting to see if Burgess will break up with quarreling girlfriend " Angela " . Another classmate , lovelorn Buzz Martin ( as Charlie James ) fawns over Mary , returning her library books and picking up after her . But , Mary isn't romantically interested in the goofy Mr . Martin . Ms . Fabares vaults into the series ' spotlight , with a young " Scarlett O'Hara " - type performance . Her " Mary " is tremendously appealing . At breakfast , Jeff ( Paul Peterson ) keenly observes , " She's reached the stage where her figure means more to her than hotcakes . " And , Donna ( Donna Reed ) advises her , " When you handle yourself , use your head . When you handle others , use your heart . " Although " The Donna Reed Show " has a " squeaky clean " reputation , the family members ' characterizations are quite naturally appealing . Herein , Ms . Reed , Carl Betz ( Alex ) , Fabares , and Mr . Peterson have excellent interplay . You may want to see Burgess , in a rare " acting " role apart from his two long-running stints as Disney " Mouseketeer " and " Lawrence Welk Show " dancer . But , the real attraction is Buzz Martin's hilarious portrayal of " Charlie " . He helps turn the series ' usual chuckles into laugh-out-loud moments . Martin has the series ' best comic guest appearance ( to date ) . Fabares and Martin are truly excellent . Mary's Double Date ( / 58 ) Oscar Rudolph - Shelley Fabares , Buzz Martin , Donna Reed
452538	15896852	164181	7.0	Kevin Bacon's Second Sight	Blue-collar lineman Kevin Bacon ( as Tom Witzky ) would have rather become a rock musician . Instead , Mr . Bacon has settled for a more ordinary life . He has just moved to a modest Chicago house , in a " decent " neighborhood . Bacon , and sexily pregnant wife Kathryn Erbe ( as Maggie Witzky ) have a mildly creepy ( but innocent looking ) young son , Zachary David Cope ( as Jake Witzky ) . Young Cope can see , and talk to , dead people . Ms . Erbe looks good in denim . She has a witchy sister , Illeana Douglas ( as Lisa Weil ) , who gets the story going , after hypnotizing Bacon into seeing dead people , too ? David Koepp's " Stir of Echoes " is a mostly effective ghost story . Bacon and the cast are terrific . Thankfully , the focus is on Bacon's protagonist , rather than kid Cody , who does not ( also , thankfully ) portray the usual annoying devil movie tot . The story is intriguing , well-paced , and nicely detailed . The " aborted kidnapping " of Cody , and " foreshadowed suicide " of Chalon Williams ( as Adam ) are two highlights . The story starts to falter when Erbe goes to find mysterious Eddie Bo Smith ( as Neil ) ; you expect the film to advance to a higher level , but the sequence ends up giving away too much . Dig it . For the " Talk About Good Taste " department : Bacon searches for the lost chords of the Rolling Stones ' " Paint it Black " ( a great version is sound-tracked , by Gob ) . Cody can't get George Romero's " Night of the Living Dead " off of his television set . And , babysitter Liza Weil ( as Debbie Kozac ) reads dog-eared paperback writer Richard Matheson's incredible " Shrinking Man " .

453003	15896852	329297	7.0	Rustling Up Some Grubbs	Pretty high school dropout Jena Malone ( as Rena Grubb ) is suicidal , after being left pregnant by her boyfriend . Fortunately , Ms . Malone is ineffective at killing herself , and returns to her trailer park home . Also returning is budding gay brother Brad Renfro ( as Jay Grubb ) , fresh from four boring weeks fishing with his uncle . They , and trashy harlot sister Alicia Witt ( as Barbie ) , live with pot-smoking mom Michelle Forbes ( as Madge Grubb ) . Prompted by Malone , the family four decide to attend an annual prison picnic , to see absent father Chris Mulkey ( as John Grubb ) , who is serving time for two murders . At the picnic , the reunited Grubbs are joined by Mr . Mulkey's prison pal Clifton Collins Jr . ( as Buddy ) . Then , skeletons begin falling out of the family closet ? " We crawl on our bellies and eat the dead , " is how Mr . Renfro describes the Grubb family . Jordan Brady's " American Girl " has some good moments , and is well-acted . But , the " dark comedy " aspect doesn't really succeed ; it might have been better to film Scott Sandoe's story as a drama . Director Brady is at his best when the family begins their picnic . Malone does a great job with her character's less suicidal , more introspective moments ; the growth of her romanticism to rage is very nicely played . Renfro's character is hardly second rate ; and , without the numerous suicide attempts , it's a more satisfying story . Renfro , and the film , are helped immensely by the appearance of Mr . Collins Jr . ' s sex " Buddy " . Clifton Collins Jr . is definitely " Best Supporting Actor " worthy . American Girl ( / 02 ) Jordan Brady - Jena Malone , Brad Renfro , Clifton Collins Jr .
453245	15896852	7539	7.0	Nazimova's First Impression	After losing both her husband and brothers to war , Alla Nazimova ( as Joan ) leads women to protest against their country's king , who has ordered women to bear children for future wars . Nazimova ends it all by proclaiming , " If you will not give us women the right to vote for or against war , " according a title card ending , " I shall not bear a child for such a country ! " ; then , she kills both herself and her unborn child . This film is , unfortunately , lost to the ages ? although , hope strings eternal . . . " War Brides " was based on Nazimova's successful stage play , and marked her film debut . Nazimova ( like Cher and Garbo , a star recognized immediately by one name ) would have made it enough to be remembered for , but " War Brides " added a bonus by presenting Richard Barthelmess ( as Arno ) in his first featured role . The " Diva " also insisted lover Charles Bryant and mother Gertrude Berkeley reprise their stage roles , for the film . Herbert Brenon , who'd been responsible for the recent epic " A Daughter of the Gods " , was employed as director . A search of " War Brides " and " A Play in One Act " will turn up the play's transcript ; but , this film version was exceedingly more elaborate . That , and a reading of Edward Weitzel's article in the December 2 , 1916 " Moving Picture World " suggest it may have been a classic . Critics applauded Nazimova's characterization , and Mr . Brenon's direction . Several of her contemporaries thought Nazimova's follow-up appearance in " Revelation " ( 1918 ) was the best female acting performance of the year . War Brides ( / 16 ) Herbert Brenon - Nazimova , Charles Bryant , Richard Barthelmess
453325	15896852	64155	7.0	High Noon for Elvis Presley	Elvis Presley plays an ex-gunman who has decided to reform . His decision is not well-received by his old gang . They beat him up , and enforce a grisly revenge - they " brand " him , to give him a scar identical to a man WANTED in two countries ( Mexico and the USA ) . The " branding " is , possibly , the most gruesome scene you'll see in a Elvis movie . This film has a classic Western Plot : Elvis is the representation of the Law - Badman gone good , friend of the Sheriff , and rival for a woman ( Ina Balin ) . Elvis has imprisoned the brother of the Badman ( Solomon Sturges , son of Preston ) . Head Badman Victor French is big brother to the jailed one . Mr . French has a deadly cannon - he says , " Release my brother , or I will blow up your town ! " This movie is too rough-around-the-edges to be extraordinary ; and , it doesn't tread on much new ground . It does , however , create a world of its own ; if you let yourself into this world , you will be entertained for the run of the film . In that way , it's like many westerns - and as good as several " classic " John Wayne films . Again , this is a rough-around-the-edges film - my vote for the roughest edges are : The background music is too hokey and repetitive ; and , I found the Sheriff's wife's betrayal too abrupt to be believable - it is interesting in that it shows the relationship between Elvis and the Sheriff is stronger than the relationship between the Sheriff and his wife ; although Elvis ' first intent is to meet the Badman's demands by releasing the prisoner , he decides to honor the Sheriff's wishes . The title song is very good ; appropriately , there are no additional songs . The performances are fine - I would taken a little more time creating this film ; still , everything about it ranges from adequate to professional . It sounds like an apology ( because Elvis Presley made so many awful films ) , but I enjoyed " Charro ! " Charro ! ( 1969 ) Charles Marquis Warren - Elvis Presley , Ina Balin , Victor French
452731	15896852	31619	7.0	The Iron Masque of Death	Intermittently exciting " Musketeers " tale , highlighted by the " Jekyll-Hyde " performance of Louis Hayward as the King of France and his undiscovered ( then , discovered ) twin brother . Mr . Hayward does a great job ; especially when the " Good " twin confronts the " Evil " twin with his " Iron Mask " . " The Man in the Iron Mask " might have been better as a swashbuckling horror story ; and , director James Whale could have delivered the goods . The Iron Mask of the title is designed for Edgar Allen Poe-type horror ? it is locked around a Hayward's neck , so that he will slowly be strangled by his own beard . A gruesome death ! I expected a little more excitement , and suspense , in this film . The other characters are enjoyable ; Joseph Schildkraut was my favorite supporting character . Joan Bennett is the beautiful love interest , but she doesn't have much of an opportunity to show any acting skills . By the way , her scene in the coach shows her looking very much like Scarlet O'Hara from " Gone with the Wind . " After seeing her in this , you can picture her testing for Scarlett . The Man in the Iron Mask ( / 39 ) James Whale - Louis Hayward , Joan Bennett , Joseph Schildkraut
453320	15896852	16461	7.0	Dust in the Wind	In the 1939 re-release's introduction , William S . Hart explains , " The story of ' Tumbleweeds ' marks one of the greatest epochs of our American history . It tells of the opening of the Cherokee Strip in the year 1889 . Twelve hundred square miles of Cherokee Indian lands , on one front , over two hundred miles long , were thrown open by our government to those seeking good earth upon which they might make their homes . " Mr . Hart ( as Don Carver ) and comic sidekick Lucien Littlefield ( as Kentucky Rose ) are two of the cattle ranchers who are put out when as the Oklahoman Cherokee Strip is " thrown open " by the government . For Hart , the silver lining comes in the form of a several decades younger sweetheart , homesteader Barbara Bedford ( as Molly Lassiter ) ; however , her nasty half-brother J . Gordon Russell ( as Noll Lassiter ) threatens to spoil the fun . Little brother Jack Murphy ( as Bart Lassiter ) and his pup have the highest profile relationship that actually works . Still , the film has Hart ; and , its exciting " land rush ! " sequence . The re-release ( which , apart from Hart's cool Shakespearian appearance , is the inferior version , by the way ) features the legendary star's farewell : " My friends , I loved the art of making motion pictures . It is as the breath of life to me ? no longer a cloud of dust , but a beautiful golden haze through which appears a long phantom herd of trailing cattle . At their head , a Pinto pony ? with an empty saddle ? the boys up ahead are calling - - they're waiting for you and me to help drive this last great round-up into eternity ? " Adios , amigos . God bless you all , each and every one . "
452653	15896852	29440	7.0	Uneven Exchange	In the slums of 16th century London , young Billy Mauch ( as " Pauper " Tom Canty ) makes the most of his life as a beggar ; though , he is beaten by his father , and thrown in the mud . Meanwhile , royal Bobby Mauch ( as " Prince " Edward VI ) lives a life of luxury ; soon , he will replace father King Henry VIII on the throne . One evening , Pauper Mauch takes refuge from a storm on Prince Mauch's palace grounds . The look-alike boys meet , and strike up a friendship . Prince Mauch invites Pauper Mauch over to the palace , where the two become intrigued by their different lifestyles , and identical appearance . After they exchange clothing , they become separated , by happenstance . When nobody believes their stories , the boys are forced to assume each other's identities . This is a well-produced version of the Mark Twain classic . Sadly , the unevenly paced scenario does not produce the film classic which was , evidently , possible ( considering those involved ) . The " Mauch Twins " and Claude Rains ( as the Earl of Hertford ) are especially strong in their portrayals ; and , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's soundtrack should be noted . Don't expect to see top-billed Errol Flynn ( as Miles Hendon ) until later in the film , as a supporting player . Alan Hale , Barton MacLane , Henry Stephenson , and Montagu Love are also worth noting ; but , the film's main strengths are Mr . Rains , Mr . Korngold , and the " Mauch Twins " .

452702	15896852	53363	7.0	Tol'able Tingler	The monster in this film is very tacky , by today's standards . You get to see too much of " The Tingler " for it to instill any real fear . The film , however , creates a world of its own ; hence , my rating is higher than I would have expected . Director Castle does great stuff with the slight budget he has , especially with the swell blood red sequence . The film is thoughtful , albeit scientifically ill-conceived . I found it most interesting that the theater is showing " Tol'able David " . That fact is revealed early on , and , sure enough , we get to see the excellent climax of " Tol'able David " . I thought it was very clever of the writers use the setting of a silent movie theater because , of course , Richard Barthelmess ' David can't be heard screaming - - no character will scream in a SILENT movie . Mr . Price and the theater owner are underdeveloped characters . I would have liked more motivation for their actions . It was great to see Darryl Hickman ( as David Morris ) in a supporting role . I wish Price's wife would have been eaten by ? the Tingler ! The Tingler ( 1959 ) William Castle - Vincent Price , Judith Evelyn , Darryl Hickman
453362	15896852	20827	7.0	One Good Turn Deserves Another	Norma Shearer ( as Jerry Martin ) tests the freedom acceptable for men , but not permissible for women - the sexual " Double Standard " . As the film opens , Ms . Shearer is an happily married woman . However , husband Chester Morris ( as Ted Martin ) gets " plastered " , and succumbs to the advances of a sexually aggressive woman ? at least , that's what is discernible from the after-the-fact behavior of the adulterous duo , as Shearer catches them in a light embrace . Disillusioned , Shearer turns the tables by having a " one night stand " of her own - with one of the soon-to-be divorced couple's pals . In a film themed like Greta Garbo's recent " The Single Standard " ( 1929 ) , MGM takes another shot at the sexual " Double Standard " . The results are similar , but not the same . Shearer's winning performance is bold , fascinating , and fun to watch ; she elevates the character far above the material . The film's problem is that it pulls its punches with a disappointing ending , extinguishing a truly interesting story . Yet , somehow , Shearer makes the character ring true . It's a strong performance , which manages to rise above the film's abandonment of its thesis . Director Robert Z . Leonard , writer John Meehan , and a fine supporting cast are a great help . Robert Montgomery's performance ( as Don ) is a standout . And , Conrad Nagel ( as Paul ) is another Shearer castoff , who has a potable problem ; he has a harrowing car crash near the film's opening . A lot of alcohol is consumed in this movie ! " The Divorcée " is a flawed , but worthwhile film . The Divorcée ( 1930 ) Robert Z . Leonard - Norma Shearer , Chester Morris , Robert Montgomery
453609	15896852	46876	7.0	The " Gill-Man " Gets His Sea Legs	In South America , ecologist Antonio Moreno ( as Carl Maia ) leads an expedition ; he is startled to find a webbed , but human-like , hand protruding from a rock . Mr . Moreno snaps the fossil from the rock , and brings it to ichthyologist Richard Carlson ( as David Reed ) , for examination . Mr . Carlson is intrigued by the hand , and wants to find more of the Creature's remains . Carlson is also enamored with bushy-eyed beauty Julie Adams ( as Kay Lawrence ) ; but , so is Carlson's wealthy colleague Richard Denning ( as Mark Williams ) . The group decide to boat the Amazon , and find the Creature ? Created by Milicent Patrick ( with Jack Kevan and Chris Mueller ) , the " Creature from the Black Lagoon " ( or " Gill-Man " ) made a big splash at the box office . Much of the time , the film displays a rushed , " low-budget " quality ; and , it was made for viewing in " 3-D " glasses . Still , the movie entertains . The " Creature " is conceptually quite interesting ; and , he has a great " look " . More importantly , the title character has personality . Mainly , this is due to his obvious attraction to Ms . Adams ' character . Perhaps , he was the last of his type , and was responding to the mating urge ? The underwater photography , by William Snyder , is superior . It's nice to see Moreno , a former " silent film " star , among the supporting players . Future " Flipper " producer Ricou Browning performs swimmingly alongside Adams . Mr . Browning was the underwater " Creature " , and Ben Chapman served as the surface " Gill-Man " . Only Browning returned , for the two sequels : " Revenge of the Creature " and " The Creature Walks Among Us " . Watch out !

453118	15896852	25586	7.0	All About Bette	Somerset Maugham's characters are brought to life in RKO's " Of Human Bondage " ; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel , with Bette Davis ' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy . Otherwise , it's the story of Leslie Howard ( as Philip Carey ) ; he dreams of becoming a painter , but is told he has no talent for the arts . As the film progresses , Mr . Howard's struggles , instead , to become a doctor . His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts ; though successful in medicine , his painting seemed easier - - also , note the symbolism of his disability , a " club foot " ( explained in the film ) . Along the way ( right away , in this version ) , Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis ( as Mildred Rogers ) . Davis ' characterization of " Mildred " is extraordinary , culminating in a spectacular speech , when she tells Howard , among other things , that she had to " WIPE MY MOUTH ! " after kissing him . Howard also performs well , but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis ; so , their performances are wasted . Still , a film to watch for the acting , including some good supporting players . Bette Davis ' characterization was famous for inspiring a " write-in " campaign for the 1934 " Best Actress " Academy Award . For the record , she placed third . The results were : 1 . Claudette Colbert - " It Happened One Night " 2 . Norma Shearer - " The Barretts of Wimpole Street " 3 . Bette Davis - " Of Human Bondage " 4 . Grace Moore - " One Night of Love "
452378	15896852	46874	7.0	The Land Around Bing	Musical stage star Bing Crosby ( as Frank Elgin ) is all washed-up in the theater ; after the accidental death of his son , he seeks solace in alcohol . Mr . Crosby's dowdy wife of ten years , Grace Kelly ( as Georgie Elgin ) , is both domineering and co-dependent . Ex-hat check boy , and Cosby fan , William Holden ( as Bernie Dodd ) becomes overly involved with the pair , while steering Cosby's boozy comeback . Mr . Holden is as dependable as always . Ms . Kelly is good , but sometimes too obvious in showing frumpiness . Surprisingly , Cosby , the least heralded dramatic actor of the threesome , outperforms his illustrious co-stars ; he really crawls beneath the surface of his character , and manages to make an almost tuneless , lackluster story much more interesting .

452548	15896852	27518	7.0	Three Hoodlum Musketeers	Great opportunity to see three of the biggest child actors of the 1930s , at different stages in their careers . The 1930s started with Jackie Cooper on top ; then , mid-decade , Freddie Bartholomew ruled ; and , finally , Mickey Rooney reigned . This film was made during Mr . Bartholomew's peak of popularity . After some promising scenes , it becomes obvious Bartholomew , Cooper , and Rooney are not being well served by the production . Some of their scenes appear rushed ; at times , it looks as if they are rehearsing alongside each other , rather than acting together . Possibly , this is due to director W . S . Van Dyke being assigned to the film , after the firing of Rowland Brown . Mr . Van Dyke was known for his sometimes hurried direction . Still , the actors are professional , and earnest ; and , some on-screen rapport is in evidence . Rowland Brown's story is excellent - - much more realistic than several similar 1930s " young hoodlum " dramas . Rooney gets the best part ; and , naturally , he makes the most of it ; scene stealers Bartholomew and Cooper wouldn't have missed a similar opportunity . This is one of Rooney's best-written , best-performed early roles ; he is a terrific actor , and his portrayal of " Gig Stevens " should be more renown . Writer Brown , fired as the film's director , would go on to pen " Angels with Dirty Faces " . With some more care , this film might have been as classic .
452393	15896852	20620	7.0	Abraham Lincoln Achieves Griffith Sainthood	If one were to commission a film depicting the life of Abraham Lincoln , in 1930 , one might well produce this film ; and , one would be very satisfied with the resulting " Abraham Lincoln " , both artistically , and commercially . Today , however , this is not a very exciting film . It succeeds somewhat as a series of staged vignettes , depicting stories about President Lincoln . Walter Huston is given the difficult job of portraying the revered Lincoln , and he excels , after a shaky start . Director D . W . Griffith employs a fine supporting cast , with mixed results . Early scenes are hampered by the characterizations offered by Una Merkel ( as Ann Rutledge ) and Kay Hammond ( as Mary Todd ) ; these are " the romances " of Lincoln's life ; and , they are awful . The courtship scenes involving Mr . Huston and Ms . Merkel are particularly absurd . Henry B . Walthall is notable , later on ; but . he doesn't have much to do . It might have been interesting to see Mr . Walthall play John Wilkes Booth - - admittedly , this was an unlikely consideration at the time ; and , Ian Keith is perfectly suitable in the role . Walthall graciously supports Hobart Bosworth ( as Robert E . Lee ) during his screen time ; and , Mr . Bosworth is outstanding . There is no mystery in the main story elements : he was born in a log cabin , and is assassinated in the end . Griffith acquaints himself well with " sound " in a film , though , in hindsight , it is a technical weakness . There are moments , or flashes , of " greatness " in the film , but they don't contribute to a collective work of consequence . Griffith treats Lincoln with a reverence that is oddly uncomfortable ; by the film's end , the story structure confirms Lincoln has become Divine . The ending reprise of " Glory ! Glory ! Hallelujah ! His truth is marching on . . . " nicely evokes both " John Brown's Body " and the " Battle Hymn of the Republic . " An appropriate connection . Abraham Lincoln ( 1930 ) D . W . Griffith - Walter Huston , Kay Hammond , Hobart Bosworth
452357	15896852	49061	7.0	Who's Afraid of Bette Davis ?	" The Catered Affair " was the movie adaptation of a Paddy Chayefsky's TV drama , which starring Thelma Ritter and Pat Henning . I'm guessing this was made due to the success of Ernest Borgnine's " Marty " . The film is interesting in its depiction of a different time , when the ceremonial aspects of weddings were very strange . Today , I doubt these people would go on and on about such trivialities . But , then , there were certain " ways " people married . There are some terrific " period " scenes . The Hurley's home is a real time trip . Great kitchen ! I loved the scene when Bette Davis takes in the frozen laundry from a clothesline outside her window . Ms . Davis totally commands the film - at times , her presence is overbearing . Her performance is excellent , but sometimes veers very close to going over-the-top . Ernest Borgnine , Debbie Reynolds , and Barry Fitzgerald hold their own in Davis ' presence . I believe , due to the presence of Bette Davis , the film should have been altered to focus more on her character . Reworked , this could have been Davis ' " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " You really have to pay attention to get what the film is really about - there is one instance where Davis ' own wedding is explained . There should be more about both Davis's dwelling on the past , and Borgnine's hopes for the future . The Catered Affair ( 1956 ) Richard Brooks - Bette Davis , Ernest Borgnine , Debbie Reynolds
452445	15896852	16039	7.0	Jurassic Start	" This was the first screen adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story of prehistoric creatures still alive on a remote Amazon plateau . An expedition is lead ( sic ) by Professor Challenger and consists of a newspaper reporter , a big-game hunter , and his servant as well as the daughter of the plateau's discoverer , who is still stranded in this uncharted land . After a long journey , the group finds the prehistoric land and encounters all kinds of remarkable plants , dinosaurs , and ape-like men , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Arthur Conan Doyle's " The Lost World " makes its impressive movie debut ; the creatures , characters , and situations continue to be imitated , with no end in sight . Oddly enough , this silent version is a case where the original is not the greatest . Herein , the creatures and humans are not scripted , directed , or edited to full advantage ; at times , it seems as if the characters are watching a dinosaur movie . More interaction between dinosaur and human was difficult , but possible ; a similar lack of contact between apeman and human is inexplicable . The possibilities lost in this outing would be found , to the extreme , in " King Kong " ( 1933 ) ; a film which makes excellent use of Willis O'Brien's extraordinary stop motion animation effects . That film certainly takes fuller advantage of human / animal interaction . " The Lost World " adds Bessie Love ( as Paula White ) , to up the expedition's romance level . Ms . Love's character wasn't even in the original novel ; so , it's an understandably weak addition . However , she helps adventurer Lewis Stone ( as John Roxton ) give the film's best performance ; as his longing for Love is just about the only interesting " non-creature " element . Wallace Beery ( as Professor Challenger ) and Lloyd Hughes ( as Edward Malone ) are good , as the film's other leading players . Unfortunately , the film includes not only explicit , but also implicit racially insensitive and inaccurate images .
453520	15896852	10103	7.0	The Eyes of Clara Are Upon You	Clara Kimball Young ( as Gina Ashling ) is at a crossroads in her life - - she has a promising operatic voice , and is invited to pursue a career in Paris ; her family , however , wants her to remain at home and help support the family . She is also being courted by a wealthy man ; however , she does not love him , and would only be marrying for financial security . ENTER a disciple from the East - - the spiritual-type Hindu ( played by Vincent Serrano , he is introduced in the film's opening ) ; he arrives to show Ms . Kimball Young his Crystal Ball - - in which she sees her future . This is an impressively mounted silent film production , with a great cast , and an ambitious story structure . The mysterious Hindu man's crystal ball provides heroine Kimball Young ( and movie viewers ) the opportunity to " see " three different future scenarios : In " The Path of Duty " she stays with the family and becomes a schoolteacher . In " The Path of Ambition " she pursues her operatic singing career . In " The Path of Wealth " she marries for money and security . You may believe a Hindu can show Kimball Young the future in a crystal ball - - but , some of the unfolding events , and choices , strain credulity . Schoolteachers and career-women are wretched creatures ! Kimball Young's performance is the film's highlight . She is not consistently great ; but , her best scenes are enough to explain her status as one of the decade's top actresses . For example , in a " Duty " scene , she checks her aged appearance in a mirror effectively . Her best work occurs in the film's final " Wealth " segment - - incredibly , she transforms herself into a gaunt , drug-addicted street-walker . The scenes with the desolate Kimball Young walking rain-drenched streets are convincing , and artful . Director Albert Parker and Kimball Young are assisted by a fine supporting cast - - the Ashling family includes brother Gareth Hughes , sister Pauline Starke , and father Sam Southern . Kimball Young's suitors include Milton Sills , Edmund Lowe , and Ralph Lewis - - all performing well . The most notable supporting player , in hindsight , is Rudolph Valentino as smarmy " Cabaret Parasite " Clarence Morgan ; he further elevates the film's fine " Path of Wealth " segment . Valentino watchers should note he appears about 50 minutes into the production . Eyes of Youth ( / 19 ) Albert Parker - Clara Kimball Young , Edmund Lowe , Rudolph Valentino
452572	15896852	10071	7.0	Gloria Swanson and the Onion Man	Gloria Swanson ( as Leila Porter ) is an understandably bored wife . Workaholic husband Elliott Dexter ( as James Denby Porter ) has " lost his romance " along with his waistline ; he also smokes cigars in bed , eats onions , and snores . He can barely remember his own anniversary - - which is attended by caddish Lew Cody ( as Schuyler Van Sutphen ) ; the younger man eyes Ms . Swanson's voluptuous figure , and flirts unabashedly . Soon , Swanson is drawn to Mr . Cody . Then , Mr . Dexter decides to try and get her back . Who will win ? The three principals are fine , with Swanson most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn . Julia Faye grabs supporting honors as Cody's other interest , " Toodles " ; off-screen , she tempted director Cecil B . DeMille . The DeMille touch is evident ; especially in an imaginary sequence wherein Cody promises Swanson . . . " Pleasure ? Wealth ? Love ? " Don't Change Your Husband ( 1919 ) Cecil B .

453407	15896852	59909	7.0	It Could Have Been Me	The story of an obscene phone caller , herein given the technical term : " The Telephone Psychotic " ; who , it is suggested , follows the natural course taken by these individuals , and becomes a homicidal killer . That does seem like a stretch , but the content of the calls certainly points in that direction . And , some of the discourse rings true . The ( believable ) fact that the obscene caller probably knows his victim makes it a more frightening . There are a lot of problems with the story ; mainly , it really isn't about an obscene " Telephone Psychotic " caller ; rather , it is about a stalker who uses to phone . Sal Mineo ( as Lawrence " Larry " Sherman ) creates an interesting character ; but , his considerable abilities as an actor do not equate with the inferior material . Mr . Mineo is , of course , the stalker . The film's structure seems to " tease " a little about the stalker's identity ; but , it is fairly obvious from the opening credits . Could the very fit young man , clad in tight briefs , possibly be co-star Jan Murray ( as Dave Madden ) ? Mineo's well-defined body is displayed very prominently throughout the film . And , he is photographed in a manner usually reserved , relatively speaking , for attractive female performers . The climax for Mineo watchers will be the pool scene occurring after his gym workout . Be sure to look for uncut prints , because the scene is trimmed in cut versions . Not to be left out , beautiful Juliet Prowse ( the object of his affection ) has a couple of sexy underwear scenes of her own ; but , they are not as lovingly shot as Mineo's . After the camera admires Mineo's body , so does Ms . Prowse ; and , she tells him , point-blank , that he has a great body . The two of them , although they are supposed to be in cinematic opposition ( stalker / victim ) are great together . Whether flirting , dancing , or struggling , they display great synergy . Elaine Stritch ( as Marian Freeman ) is another in the cast who deserved a better production . Ms . Stritch has been quoted as explaining , " I was a lesbian owner of a disco who fell in love with Juliet Prowse and got strangled on 93rd Street and East End Avenue with a silk stocking by Sal Mineo . Now who's not going to play to play that part ? " Stritch gets to tell Prowse , " I dig soft things , " and makes a small pass at the young woman ( her employee , by the way ) . Prowse's character overreacts , which leads directly to Stritch's death . Also disturbing ( probably intentionally ) is officer Murray's 10-year-old daughter listening in on her father's sex tapes . When she sees Prowse , she asks her dad , " Is she a hooker ? " This parallels a situation in Mineo's home . In fact , Mineo , Murray , and Stritch's characters are related to each other in symbolic ways ; and , they all desire Prowse ( who desires Mineo ) . At least , the story is an interesting failure . The New York City locations are great ; the movie brought Michael Chapman to filmdom . The dancing of Sal Mineo and high-heeled Juliet Prowse during the " It Could Have Been Me " song is a swimming classic ( or , should have been ) .

452938	15896852	374252	7.0	Ballad of a Thin Man	To celebrate the coming of age eighteen , boyish virgin Andre Noble ( as Cliff ) hits the streets , with a bottle of vodka and a joint . His nighttime cruising leads Mr . Noble directly to handsome bisexual hustler Brendan Fehr ( as Butch ) . For Noble , it's love at first sight - but , Mr . Fehr has locked his closet with drugs and denial . Can two gay young men find love in a repressive society ? The answer to that question should be obvious ( which is unfortunate on more than one level ) . Although you can't ( as yet ) rattle off a series of mega-popular " coming of age " gay romances , the topic has been approached enough to make much of what happens in " Sugar " expected . But , the film is so well cast , and covers most of its ground so believably ( based on stories told by Bruce La Bruce ) , it overcomes the predictable . John Palmer's " Sugar " is sweetest when Noble and Fehr are interacting on screen - it's a typical " anti-romance " ; but , the two play it as well as James Dean and Sal Mineo might have . Little sister Haylee Wanstall ( as Cookie ) and mom Marnie McPhail ( as Madge ) are an unimaginably kwel family . Some graphic sexual content is integral to the film - one standout scene involves Fehr compassionately satisfying an obese woman ( Pat Butcher ) - another ( with Michael Riley ) illustrates Fehr's inability to " legitimately " consummate his love for Noble . They are filmed well ; but , was it really necessary to have everyone except the two lead actors go full frontal in the limo ? In a tragedy having nothing to do with the plot of " Sugar " , Noble died , shortly after its premiere . He would have , obviously , had additional success as an actor . Fehr bravely essays his role as the object of Noble's affection . By the way , his question to Noble about the " last time " is his directive / permission to move on . . . " We had fun , didn't we ? " Yeah , it might have been a little scary , but it was fun . Sugar ( 2004 ) John Palmer - Andre Noble , Brendan Fehr , Haylee Wanstall
452520	15896852	16655	7.0	Lon Chaney Gets Bent Out of Shape	London's Limehouse District , " with its lust , greed , and love , " lightly blankets its citizens in a sea of fog . There , ambidextrous Lon Chaney ( as Dan Tate ) successfully spends his nights thieving as " The Blackbird " ; and , otherwise , masquerading as his own benevolent , but deformed , brother " The Bishop " . Mr . Chaney likes to visit the local pub , where he falls for charming French entertainer Renée Adorée ( as Fifi Lorraine ) . But , Ms . Adorée also attracts suave Owen Moore ( as Bertram P . Glayde ) . Mr . Moore is a rival crook , who goes by the name " West End Bertie " . So , conniving Chaney uses his respectable " Bishop " disguise to come between the increasingly more successful Adorée-Moore romance . This is a formulaic Browning / Chaney film , featuring one of the versatile actor's lesser " disguises " . For his transformation , Cheney twists an arm and a leg out of shape . It's more difficult than it looks to walk around in the disjointed position . Of course , Chaney's performance is outstanding . In particular , watch his reaction shots , which are incredibly accurate in mirroring whatever he is looking at , or reacting to . Co-stars Moore and Adorée also shine . Adorée had just been seen in " The Big Parade " , and Moore has one of his meatier 1920s roles . Also enjoyable is Doris Lloyd ( as " Limehouse " Polly ) , the ex-wife who loves Chaney .

453225	15896852	51337	7.0	There Were Giants in the Earth	Kerwin Mathews ( as Sinbad ) and his crew must undertake a dangerous mission , at the behest of Magician Torin Thatcher ( as Sokurah ) . In return , the sorcerer promises to restore Mr . Mathews ' shrunken fiancée Kathryn Grant ( as Princess Parisa ) to normal size . Among other daring feats , Mathews must retrieve an eggshell from the Roc , a giant two-headed bird . Boy Genie Richard Eyer ( as Baronni ) is around , when summoned , to help out . Ray Harryhausen's special effects are the acknowledged " star " ; but , most of the cast , led by the heroic Mathews and the villainous Thatcher , are perfect . The color photography ( Wilkie Cooper ) and soundtrack ( Bernard Herrmann ) are also outstanding . Overall , the film's story lacks a certain cohesiveness , however ; and , the skeletal duel near the film's end was notably outdone , by the filmmakers ' own " Jason and the Argonauts " ( 1963 ) . Still , " The 7th Voyage of Sinbad " serves up classic afternoon adventure . Especially memorable is Harryhausen's hungry Cyclops ; literally , he's a creature to die for .
452625	15896852	13140	8.0	A Woman and Her Money Are Soon Parted	Three Russian aristocrats lease a villa from which they can luxuriously enjoy Monte Carlo . They are : maid-pinching Maude George ( as Princess Olga Petchnikoff ) , blonde-wigged Mae Busch ( as Princess Vera Petchnikoff ) , and monocled lady-killer Erich von Stroheim ( as Count Wladislaw Sergius Karamzin ) . You should also keep an eye on their foolish maid , Dale Fuller ( as Maruschka ) . Mr . von Stroheim is the film's star , director , and writer . It becomes obvious the trio are really counterfeiting con artists . The gang of three are intrigued by the notice of the arrival of American Envoy Rudolph Christians ( as Andrew J . Hughes ) and his wife Miss DuPont ( as Helen ) ; they decide to strike up a societal acquaintanceship with the Americans , to help provide cover for their swindling . Then , von Stroheim shows Ms . DuPont his stiff cane , and give her bare legs a leer ? Have a great laugh when Ms . DuPont , while applying her face cream , declares she is twenty-one years old ; husband's reply he that is a sun-burned forty-one shows he can shave off years with the best of them . Mr . Christians died during the production , and his white-haired replacement , back to the camera , is obvious ; with all the expense obviously spent on " Foolish Wives " , it's difficult to understand why von Stroheim could not add a little bit of cheap shoe polish to Robert Edeson's head . There are other problems with the story , which was brutally cut down from a multi-hour epic . Still , the studio heads could not cut the neither the length of von Stroheim's cigarettes , nor the fact that his ( vanity ) production of " Foolish Wives " retains its spectacle .
453722	15896852	462504	8.0	Better Run Through the Jungle	" In 1965 , an American pilot on a top-secret bombing mission was shot down over Laos and taken to a hellish prison camp deep in the impenetrable jungle of Vietnam . What followed was one of the most remarkable and harrowing experiences of the entire Vietnam War . Inspired by the true story of Dieter Dengler ( Christian Bale ) and written and directed by internationally acclaimed filmmaker Werner Herzog , ' Rescue Dawn ' is an uncanny tale of camaraderie and betrayal , courage in the face of despair , and triumph over tragedy . It stands as a true testament to the impossible boundaries of the human condition and the invincibility of the American spirit , " according to the official synopsis . " Empty that which is full . Fill that which is empty . " As it is based on a true story , Werner Herzog's " Rescue Dawn " is convincing in its characterization of " Dieter Dengler " and his experiences as a Vietnam War POW . The jungle ( Thailand for Laos ) setting and nameless Asian extras give the film a very realistic landscape . And , fictionalized " artistic license " is in capable hands with Mr . Herzog , photographer Peter Zeitlinger , and editor Joe Bini . Oddly , there isn't much to suggest the 1965-set film couldn't have taken place in 1985 or 2005 - the World Series is briefly mentioned , but nobody mentions JFK , Cassius Clay , James Bond , or the Beatles ; and , there are no soundtrack hits ( the music , by Klaus Badelt , is absolutely a plus , though ) . " Let the people know my wisdom . Fill the land with smoke . " Criticisms do not detract from the story , however , which is elevated from a Vietnam War movie to a more universal story of conflict , friendship , and survival . The setting is secondary to the characters ' relationships , and the triumph of the human spirit . Mr . Bale and the cast embody rather than act their characters . As fellow prisoners maddeningly afflicted with more years in the POW camp , Steve Zahn ( as Duane Martin ) and Jeremy Davies ( as Gene DeBruin ) are best supporting actors . The scene where Bale hallucinates returning Mr . Zhan's shoe quite effectively illustrates the guilt , love , and madness of war .

452359	15896852	47849	8.0	Stranger in Town	Spencer Tracy is an old one-armed man who goes to town in " Bad Day at Black Rock " . He wants to give a medal to an old war buddy's father ( who saved his life ) . I was a little confused by this backstory ; I wondered why everyone didn't just tell Mr . Tracy his friend's father passed away . Now , that I think about it , I'm sure the filmmakers must have wanted us to think Tracy's character was much younger . That , and one of Tracy's almost super-human feats , are the film's major flaws . Otherwise , it's great . Tracy's performance carried the film - he is an immediate visual intrusion on this old western-style town ; instead of western gear , he wears a regular suit . Although it's a dark suit , Tracy's performance relays the fact that he is the " good guy " . John Sturges does an excellent job directing ; I've seen the Sturges credit on a number of films , and believe this may be his best . Robert Ryan and the citizens of Black Rock work very well indeed with Sturges and Tracy . This is a film I'm looking forward to seeing again .

453142	15896852	316654	8.0	Tobey Maguire's Back , Spinning Another Web	The " Spider-Man 2 " movie is just a shade better than the first - which , in series films , is a cause for tremendous celebration . Happily , producers were able to pay director Sam Raimi and his main cast however many millions of dollars they needed . . . Also , the first film's " special effects " ( however well done ) seemed too startlingly change from live action to animation . This is still fairly obvious , but done much more smoothly ; and , the " Dr . Octopus " villain costume is a cinematic success . Like they say , " ( special effects director John ) Frazier is especially effective ( along with over a hundred helpers ) . " Allowing for a comic book aficionado to be a little too critical , it does seem like an extraordinary amount of time is spent on illustrating the " downtrodden " life of " Peter Parker " ( which is the main plot , I know , but it's a very large chunk of the movie ) . And , although Tobey Maguire ( as Peter Parker ) is wonderful in the role , he and Kirsten Dunst ( as Mary Jane Watson ) aren't going to be able to convincingly play " Peter " and " M . J . " as " teenagers in love " much longer . It will be interesting to see how producers continue this relationship , which seems to be , herein , necessary for " Spider-Man " to remain fully powerful . Alfred Molina ( as Otto Octavius ) rises to the challenge of playing the " visual effects " - enhanced villain role . Handsome " best friend " James Franco ( as Harry Osborn ) returns , to hint at becoming the new " Green Goblin " ; as in the first film , the actor doesn't seem to be used to his potential ( although , it looks like he will get a chance to put on a costume in the next film ) . My " No-Prize Awards " winners include : Elyse Dinh for playing the " friendly neighborhood Spider-Man " theme song , Rosemary Harris for being " Aunt May " , Hal Sparks for being so funny , and Stan Lee for believing in Super-Heroes .

452458	15896852	36962	8.0	Writing on the Wall	" It Happened Tomorrow " could have stood a better beginning - the choice to introduce the story with elderly Dick Powell and Linda Darnell ( as Larry and Sylvia Smith ) celebrating 50 years of wedded bliss sacrifices the story's surprises . The film does possess the light touch required to make the framing sequence charming . But , director René Clair and Mr . Powell build an unexpectedly good level of suspense regarding Powell's courtship , and mortality . They are so good , you can almost forget how much the opening gives away ? Watch for a thoroughly delightful ( and unfortunately rare ) performance by sagely John Philliber ( as " Pop " Benson ) . He plays the keeper of the " Evening News " " morgue " ( a place where newspapers keep obituaries and other files ) . Possibly , Mr . Philliber had read his own notice ; he died in 1944 . Powell was also able to read the writing on the wall , and saved his fledgling career by pursuing more interesting roles ( like this one ) . Jackie Oakie and Edgar Kennedy are also on board . A subtle celebration of life , and its mysteries . It Happened Tomorrow ( / 44 ) René Clair - Dick Powell , Linda Darnell , John Philliber

Peter Bogdanovich's direction , László Kovács ' beautiful black and white photography , and the nostalgic soundtrack help put " Paper Moon " over . The O'Neals are at their very best - - full advantage of their genetic harmony is taken ; and , it's not an idea that always works , on screen . Madeline Kahn ( as Trixie Delight ) heads up an outstanding supporting cast . Mr . Bogdanovich's vision of Joe David Brown's " Paper Moon " may not always find its place on the " comedy-drama " scale ; but , it's still an excellent film .

He is , however , one-eyed , overweight , old , and ( probably ) alcoholic . That doesn't matter to Kim Darby ( as Mattie Ross ) , because Mr . Wayne has " ? grit , true grit " . So , Ms . Darby gives him $25 . 00 to catch the man who murdered her father . To catch the killer , Wayne teams up with Glen Campbell ( as " La Boeuf " ) , a Texas Ranger who is also interested in capturing elusive Jeff Corey ( as Tom Chaney ) . The men are reluctantly saddled with young Darby ; and , the three set out on an increasingly dangerous hunt ? " True Grit " features one of the best later decades Wayne characterizations , showing how well the actor could handle a good role , when one was provided . Another reason for the film's success is the contrast of Wayne with plucky Darby , who serves as both business partner and thematic nemesis . Wayne knew his box office power was kept high with " generation gap " casts ; and , " Grit " is further enhanced by Mr . Campbell , the then hot young country singer . Even better , in hindsight , are gun-swingers Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper . Marguerite Roberts ' screenplay and Lucien Ballard's cinematography are first class . You've got to see Darby horse-trading with Strother Martin . And , Wayne's meeting with his " Four Horsemen " is classic .
453479	15896852	407304	8.0	Lightning Strikes Twice	Get ready for a wild ride with the Steven Spielberg " DreamWorks " production team , in this high quality revision of H . G . Wells ' " War of the Worlds " . For this invasion , the story has been updated to focus on the family changes which have become most dominant over the decades since the successful 1953 version . So , the central figure , Tom Cruise ( as Ray Ferrier ) , is not a doctor , but a more ordinary New Jersey dock worker . And , the lead character played by Mr . Cruise is made much more interesting by the fact that he is a divorced man , who is somewhat estranged from his children . Instead of the expected " hot romance " , you have the drama unfolding around the bonding of Cruise and his children . Of course , a lot of disbelief suspension is required , especially in this type of film ; but , the updated situation is refreshing , and believable . When the film begins , Cruise's ex-wife drops off the couple's two children while she goes off to spend some time with her new husband , and parents , in Boston . The children are played well , by Justin Chatwin ( Robbie Ferrier ) and Dakota Fanning ( Rachel Ferrier ) . There is a point ( foreshadowed twice ) where Mr . Chatwin leaves the action ; it seems like a flaw in the storytelling ; but , it does work out quite well . The " son " is replaced by Tim Robbins ( as Harlan Ogilvy ) , in some scenes which would not have worked with the original threesome . Cruise deserves some particular praise , for his performance . He is especially good after suffering a loss , then taking refuge in Mr . Robbins ' basement ; observe his fight to overcome madness , and protect his daughter , in the bowels of the Earth . Cruise's tearful rendition of " Little Deuce Coupe " is one of the film's most memorable moments ; and , it involves no observable " special effect " . The alien " special effects " are fantastic . John Williams is outstanding .

453130	15896852	38975	8.0	Some Must Watch	A serial murderer is on the loose , in a New England town . The killer's latest victim succumbs as maid / companion Dorothy McGuire ( as Helen ) enjoys one of the town theater's latest silent movie " flickers " , directed by D . W . Griffith . Her employers , the wealthy Warren family , believe Ms . McGuire's life is in danger , as she is a mute ; and , all the victims have suffered from a disability . Their concerns are , of course , dead on . " The Spiral Staircase " is as unpredictable as the sunrise ; and , McGuire's physical condition , ( presumably , she's a self-inflicted mute ) strains credulity to extreme limits - but , the film's direction , performances , and overall style are so well-done , it doesn't matter . Director Robert Siodmak and star McGuire are beautifully matched . Steadfast George Brent ( as Albert Warren ) and nipping Elsa Lanchester ( as Mrs . Oates ) lead the charge , in choice roles . But , Ethel Barrymore ( as Mrs . Warren ) is especially commanding ; she acts up a storm , though confined to a sick bed . Barrymore's cranky , creepy , and perceptive performance is the film's most riveting . By the way , the silent film McGuire sees during the opening murder is not " The Kiss " , but " The Sands of Dee " ( 1912 ) , starring Mae Marsh and Robert Harron . Ms . Marsh does receive a fateful kiss in the old film , but it is not shown . " The Spiral Staircase " picks up with Marsh being thrown out of the house by her parents , after a fling with a painter . Mr . Harron is the young man who frantically searches for his departed love . Harron was one of the 1910s best actors ( perhaps the best ) ; and , the emotions he helps elicit from McGuire's " Helen " ring true .

453081	15896852	337921	8.0	Get Larry Cohen on the Line	" What if someone's life was literally on the line and the power to save them was totally in your hands ? For Ryan ( Chris Evans ) , the choice begins with a frantic call from Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) . Having been kidnapped at gunpoint and locked in an undisclosed attic , Jessica pleads with Ryan to get help before her abductors return to kill her . With no way of knowing where she is , and with the battery in his cell dying quickly , Ryan is plunged into a relentless , high-stakes thrill ride through a world of lies and murder in this riveting , adrenaline-pumping suspense thriller , " according to the film's official synopsis . So many movies attempt to do what " Cellular " does , and so many fail . This film has everything you need in an " adrenaline-pumping suspense thriller . " Director David R . Ellis , editor Eric Sears , and their production crew know exactly what they're producing . It's a roller-coaster ride of excitement . The film's pace is ideal ; and , the story always manages to stay a step ahead of you ( which is absolutely essential in a film of this type ) . The " revelation " about what is happening to the Martin family stays just out of reach when it needs to , and enhances the action when it's discovered . Writers Larry Cohen and Chris Morgan come up with some great plot-enhancing uses for the cell phone . It's interesting that Mr . Cohen wrote the excellent " Phone Booth " ( 2002 ) , which kept its hero ( Colin Farrell ) inside an antiquated telephone booth , while " Cellular " has its hero ( Chris Evans ) racing all around Los Angeles , on a modern cell phone . Obviously , Cohen knows his phones . Handsome young Evans and beautifully aging Kim Basinger are sexy and captivating ; and , William H . Macy ( as Bob Mooney ) leads a super-supporting cast . Listen for Evans ' ending line to Ms . Basinger - it's a perfect coda . Cellular ( / 04 ) David R . Ellis - Chris Evans , Kim Basinger , William H . Macy
453523	15896852	26174	8.0	Errol Flynn in His Star-Making Turns	Errol Flynn ( as Peter Blood ) is a doctor who quite rightly helps Rebels against Royalty and is condemned to slavery for his offense ; he is bought by Olivia de Havilland ( as Arabella ) , to serve her ruthless Uncle Lionel Atwell ( as Colonel Bishop ) . Soon , " Doctor Blood " escapes to become swashbuckling pirate " Captain Blood " . Mr . Flynn is remarkably new and good in this film ; though he is made-up , he is not made-over - so , his naturalness is stunning . Understandably , the studio outfitted him more and more into these roles ; while they are great , you will see a much more natural performance from Flynn in this film . Ms . de Havilland is likewise new and good ; together , they get magical - assisted by Michael Curtiz ' direction and Hal Mohr's photography . There are some wittily written passages , and a crew of sporting supporting Pirates . While the action sequences will pale by today's standards , the film's pluses will remain timeless . Some asides : I expected scriptwriters to bump off Ross Alexander ( as Jeremy Pitt ) ; he is the best supporting actor , and I was pleasantly surprised by the character's treatment . I don't mind most flaws , but supposedly dead bodies opening their eyes is one that bothers me ; watch for a certain character to open his eyes after death ; specifically , when the second ocean waves over his body ( WHY didn't they just cut out the second wave ? ) Captain Blood ( 1935 ) Michael Curtiz - Errol Flynn , Olivia de Havilland , Ross Alexander
452502	15896852	2082	8.0	Robert Harron Gets the Third Degree	Entertaining early film , directed by D . W . Griffith ; " Representing the manipulation of the third degree - the fallacy of circumstantial evidence " ! Herein , the third degree is issued to young burglar Robert Harron , who protests so loudly " I didn't do it ! " you can almost hear him shout . The set-up is terrific : Weak brother Henry B . Walthall lives with older and stronger Lionel Barrymore . Meanwhile , burglar Harron is goaded by older crook Harry Carey to go out and rob somebody . He will go to rob Barrymore . BUT , before he gets there , a drunken Walthall has had enough of brother Barrymore , and pops him one . When Harron arrives to rob the place , Walthall decides to frame Harron for the murder of his brother . To wit , Walthall leaves Harron locked in the house , and runs for the police . So , Griffith sets out to prove what he calls , " The fallacy of circumstantial evidence . " The film is a lot of fun - - especially in the performances of Harron , Walthall , and Barrymore . The Gish sisters have a cameo . Note how Griffith sets up a parallel between the two sets of men . " The Burglar's Dilemma " ends a little too quickly , and gives away too much , but it's still excellent . The Burglar's Dilemma ( 1912 ) D . W . Griffith - Robert Harron , Henry B Walthall , Lionel Barrymore
452759	15896852	17423	8.0	A Child Shall Lead Them	An introduction explains : " The Devil's share in the world's creation was a certain swampland , a masterpiece of horror ; and the Lord , appreciating a good job , let it stand . " The Devil's swampland is where Mary Pickford ( as Molly ) lives , with some orphans and a baby . Ms . Pickford has managed to avoid being thrown in the swamp , over the years , and has assumed the role of " Mother " to the young children . They are kept , as " baby farm " slaves , by wicked Gustav von Seyffertitz ( as Mr . Grimes ) . Mr . von Seyffertitz , Charlotte Mineau ( as Mrs . Grimes ) and Spec O'Donnell ( as son Ambrose ) make a frightfully wicked family . Pickford employs too many of the girlish pouts and lip-twisting grimaces to make this one of her best characterizations ; playing " Molly " as a young woman of indeterminate age would have been fine ( something Pickford would do in her next film , the extraordinary " My Best Girl " ) . Otherwise , the Pickford persona works . As might be expected , the production is first class . Harry Oliver's swampy set is magnificent . The direction of William Beaudine and photography of Charles Rosher , Hal Mohr , and Karl Struss likewise superb . The too long conclusion is noticeably anti-climatic . The special effects and editing are still convincing viewers that Pickford and the children were in some kind of danger during the " alligator-infested swamp escape " sequence . In Booten Herndon's " Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks " ( 1977 ) Mr . Mohr explains , " There wasn't an alligator within ten miles of Miss Pickford . Do people think we were crazy ? I shot that scene myself ? It was hard work for all of us , but the only thing those alligators came close to biting was a chunk of horsemeat . " Fewer people questioned Pickford's meeting with Jesus Christ , in an earlier scene .
453166	15896852	17419	8.0	Light and Dark Shadows from D . W . Griffith	In the film's prelude , Lucifer is thrown out of Heaven , after rebelling against God's creation of " man in His divine image . " Lucifer is forced to change his name to Satan , and is cursed to forever " tempt the sons of men to sin against the God who made you both ! " Redemption is offered : " Only when all men turn from thee , canst thou resume thy glorious place at God's right hand ? for every soul that resists thee , thou shalt have one hour at the gates of Paradise ! " The prelude is significant ; it sets Satan up as a cursed , sympathetic villain . He is awarded an hour close to Paradise for every soul who resists his compelling ( and compelled , by God ! ) invitation to sin . This sets up one of the film's greatest sequences , the resisting of temptation , by Carol Dempster ( as Mavis Claire ) , upon meeting Adolphe Menjou ( as Prince Lucio de Rimanez ) at a party . But , first , director D . W . Griffith introduces the more luckless and susceptible protagonist , Ricardo Cortez ( as Geoffrey Tempest ) . Mr . Cortez is a poverty-stricken writer , living in the " humble quarter of a great old city " . His boarding house is inhabited by another struggling writer , the self-described not " too beautiful " Ms . Dempster ; she lives across the hall . Cortez is initially interested in Dempster for sex , but she is falling in love . The first part of the film deals with the convergence of their interests . The culmination is very well relayed by Dempster and Cortez - you can witness passion entering Dempster's thoughts as Cortez becomes love-struck . All seems to be going well for the couple . But , on the eve of wedding , Cortez is fired from his job writing book reviews . His boss explains , " We find you condemn books that every one likes , and praise books that no one likes . " Cortez curses God , triggering the thundering , Faustian appearance of Mr . Menjou , as Satan . Cortez receives the spellbinding news that a previously unknown uncle has made him " one of the richest men in the world . " Menjou thwarts Cortez ' efforts to share his luxurious news with Dempster ; instead , providing him with sexy cigarette-sucking vamps , like Lya De Putti ( as Olga Godovsky ) . Meanwhile , Dempster sinks into depression . In her despair , she turns to God ( Lord Christ ) . So , Dempster is able to resist Menjou's invitation to wickedness - the great Griffith sequence alluded to above occurs ; and , it is lighted , directed , and performed extraordinarily well , by Griffith and company . The film's sets , backgrounds , lighting , and photography are exceptional throughout . Admittedly , Griffith spends too much time on making the opening stark , staid , and ordinary . And , the film's pace is slow , with too few edited breaks . Still , " The Sorrows of Satan " is an excellent film . And , it's more faithful to writer Marie Corelli's original works than Carl Theodor Dreyer's more freely adapted " Blade af Satans bog " ( 1921 ) . Interestingly , both Griffith and Dryer bring forth Corelli's popularized view of Satan as a sympathetic entity , cursed by God . More interestingly , Griffith produces a relatively ordinary picture , while Dryer's film patterns itself after Griffith's opulent " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) , which had little to do with Corelli . Finally , unrelated to the film , but nonetheless noteworthy , this was the last product of the Griffith / Dempster partnership . The Sorrows of Satan ( 1926 ) D . W . Griffith - Ricardo Cortez , Carol Dempster , Adolphe Menjou
453286	15896852	61385	8.0	Dancing Barefoot	Jane Fonda ( she's Corie ) and Robert Redford ( he's Paul ) are a deliriously happy newlywed couple who begin their wedded days in a modest five-flight high New York City walk-up apartment . Her mother , Mildred Natwick , is their most frequent visitor ; she becomes involved with neighbor in the attic Charles Boyer . This film is a BIG improvement over Ms . Fonda's previous New York City situation comedies " Sunday in New York " ( 1963 ) and " Any Wednesday " ( 1966 ) . The " situation " isn't sexual ( it's mainly the apartment ) , and the material is much better . Fonda and Mr . Redford are fine , and supporters Ms . Natwick and Mr . Boyer are a delight to watch . You can't help but wonder : how are all these people exhausted by five flights , with the possible exception of Boyer ? I also worried , more than laughed , about Natwick falling . Still , " Barefoot in the Park " is a well-done comedy with a satisfying ending . If you are familiar with the 1966-1971 TV program " Dark Shadows " , watch Redford's performance closely . He reminded me of Joel Crothers ' role of " Joe Haskell " . Both Redford and Crothers played Neil Simon's " Paul " on Broadway , and I would say Mr . Crothers brought some of that character to his role on " Dark Shadows " . Barefoot in the Park ( 1967 ) Gene Saks - Jane Fonda , Robert Redford , Mildred Natwick
453434	15896852	37059	8.0	Home is Where the Heart Is	Judy Garland ( star ) and Vincente Minnelli ( director ) team-up for a classic MGM musical . Ms . Garland is the focus of the camera's attention as part of a sweet St . Louis family ; with younger sister Margaret O'Brien following close behind . The other players are suitably supporting . The film is beautifully photographed , with extraordinary colorful sets and locations . This " Smith Family of St . Louis " is a studio " creation " , and probably looks like no actual St . Louis town that ever existed - - but , that is irrelevant . The film's musical numbers are very strong , with " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas " my choice the highlight ( it's nearer the end of the film ) . " The Trolley Song " and title song are not far behind . Garland performs them perfectly . I thought the song " You and I " was very much like the song " True Love " - - it seems like one swiped the other . Ms . O'Brien is both sweet and tearful , holding her own with a stellar cast . She played the role wonderfully , but I was distracted by some of her character's actions . I have been through a lot of Halloweens , but never like the one O'Brien experiences . Perhaps that is how the evening was celebrated ? I found it strange , even with her " bad girl " tendencies . Note also the film as a message curiously similar to " The Wizard of Oz " .

452887	15896852	15136	8.0	The Victor	Master painter Benjamin Christensen ( as Claude Zoret ) doesn't like the sketches offered for review by budding artist Walter Slezak ( as Michael ) ; instead , he asks the attractive young man to become his model . Mr . Christensen takes a liking to Mr . Slezak ; and , soon , they are like father and son . Then , an alluring woman arrives to request Christensen paint her portrait . Young Slezak is attracted to his benefactor's feminine model , Nora Gregor ( as Countess Zamikoff ) ; and , the young models begin an affair . Christensen becomes despondent over the loss of his ward's attentions . While carrying on with Ms . Gregor , Slezak takes increasing advantage of Christensen's generosity . Will the old painter cut him off ? The homosexuality currently heralded to be found in Carl Theodor Dreyer ' " Michael " is so subtle it's almost invisible . The Christensen-Slezak couplings must have occurred during their time in Algiers , which is over when the film begins . An even earlier affair , between Christensen and Robert Garrison ( as Charles Switt ) , is a little clearer . It's nice to see cinematographer Karl Freund ( as M . Leblanc ) , the art dealer who informs Christensen that Slezak is endeavoring to sell " The Victor " , a painting which symbolizes their once close relationship . " Michael " requires more concentration than your average silent ; to help , the overall production is excellent .

453608	15896852	41587	8.0	Special Delivery	Joseph L . Mankiewicz ' beautifully directed , and wittily written , tale of post-1940s America begins with " A Letter to Three Wives " : " Dearest Debby , Lora Mae , and Rita - As you know , by now , you'll have to carry on without me from here . It isn't easy to leave a town like our town , to tear myself away from you three dear , dear friends who have meant so much to me . And so , I consider myself extremely lucky to be able to take with me a sort of memento , something to remind me always of the town that was my home . And , of my three very dearest friends , whom I want never to forget . And , I won't . You see - girls - I've run off with one of your husbands . - Addie " The three troubled wives are : World War II veteran " W . A . V . E " Jeanne Crain ( as Deborah Bishop ) , beautiful gold-digging Linda Darnell ( as Lora Mae Hollingsway ) , and radio career " gal " Ann Sothern ( as Rita Phipps ) . Fetching narrator Celeste Holm ( as Addie Ross ) professes to have absconded with one of her three " dearest " friends ' husbands : Is it charming schoolteacher Kirk Douglas ( as George Phipps ) , rich and forceful Paul Douglas ( as Porter Hollingsway ) , or young and worldly Jeffrey Lynn ( as Bradford Bishop ) ? Under Mankiewicz ' expert direction , the wedded six perform very well . The couples have , arguably , less " chemistry " than you might expect ; however , this helps suspend disbelief regarding the film's plot . At times , the unrelated Douglas actors ( Paul and Kirk ) seem to be the " voice " of Mankiewicz ; and , their parts are expertly performed . The women are all terrific . The three lead actresses receive fantastic support from Connie Gilchrist ( as Ruby Finney ) , Florence Bates ( as Mrs . Manleigh ) , and Thelma Ritter ( as Sadie Dugan ) . Ms . Ritter , in an early role , was not credited ; but , her role is substantial . And , it was nice to see Mae Marsh in a small role . Unfortunately , the film's eagerly anticipated ending is a little weak . A Letter to Three Wives ( 1949 ) Joseph L . Mankiewicz - Jeanne Crain , Linda Darnell , Ann Sothern
452902	15896852	2473	8.0	Surf's Up	Robert Harron's performance from " The Sands of Dee " is showcased in Dore Schary's 1945 box office hit " The Spiral Staircase " , starring Dorothy McGuire . In the film's opening , Ms . McGuire is at a nickelodeon , thrilled by Mr . Harron's desperate search for his lost love ; meanwhile , a serial murderer is claiming Myra Dell . It appears as if a superior print of D . W . Griffith's " The Sands of Dee " was used in the Dore Schary-produced film ; so , where is it ? Before the events projected in " The Spiral Staircase " , Harron ( as Bobby ) is rejected by leading lady Mae Marsh ( as Mary ) . Ms . Marsh forsakes Harron's boyish charms for sophisticated painter Edwin August , after Mr . August flatters her , and steals a kiss . Harron wanders sadly along the beach , and slumps over some rocks . Marsh is happy with her new love , but finds the fickle finger of fate pointing her toward tragedy ? Director Griffith and photographer G . W . Bitzer create beautiful seaside location images . Marsh and Harron perform expertly together ; and , audiences longed to see them reunited . Charles Hill Mailes and Grace Henderson are notable , among the always dependable Griffith stable of supporting players . The poetic on-screen story is a believable adaptation of Charles Kingsley's original , simpler poem . The Sands of Dee ( 1912 ) D . W . Griffith - Mae Marsh , Robert Harron , Edwin August
452460	15896852	30378	8.0	Billy Halop leads " The Dead End Kids " to Universal	In their third team appearance , " The ' Dead End ' Kids " are : Billy Halop ( as Johnny Boylan ) , Huntz Hall ( as " Pig " ) , Gabriel Dell ( as " String " ) , Bernard Punsly ( as " Ape " ) , Hal E . " Hally " Chester ( as " Dopey " ) , and David Gorcey ( as " Sniper " ) . After this film , Universal Pictures , the third of several studios to cash in on the Kids ' popularity , adopted " Little Tough Guys " as a series co-title ; possibly , in case United Artists or Warner Brothers legally challenged their use of " Dead End Kids " . In this film " Little Tough Guy " refers to Mr . Halop only , the leader of the pack . Universal was only able to obtain four original " Dead Enders " for their first outing ; so , substituting for Bobby Jordan and Leo Gorcey , and making their first appearances as members of the expanding " Bowery " team , are " Hally " Chester and David Gorcey ( Leo's brother ) . Both would continue with the group . Brat packer Jackie Searl ( as Cyril Gerrard ) , who not only joins , but also takes over as " Little Tough Guys " leader , would only make a couple of peripheral reappearances . Herein , his snobbishness balances the grim and gritty quite nicely . Although you wouldn't expect it , this is one of the best " little " films in the whole " Dead End-East Side-Bowery Kid " cache . The plot is fairly typical , but handled well - Halop's teen angst turns to anger after his father is wrongly arrested , for killing a policeman . Following a miscarriage of justice , Halop soothes his sorrows by descending into a " Dead End " lifestyle . Halop has a firm grasp of this material , and performs the melodrama with his usual expertise . Another cast member tuning in an excellent performance is matronly Marjorie Main ( as Mrs . Boylan ) . A keen actress , Ms . Main gives her " mother " character an almost unseemly underbelly . Note how Main's " theatrics " fit perfectly with the lines her children address her with : daughter Helen Parish ( as Kay Boylan ) says , " Oh Mom , quit acting , " and Halop tells Main , " Gee , Ma , you look just like a movie star . " So , Main plays her part as a failed movie star , lamenting her age and poverty . The 1930s New York City interior and exterior sets are terrific . Halop says , " I gotta keep moving , " and director Harold Young fills the running time with a lot of movement - there are people everywhere . Both Young and photographer Elwood Bredell excel . Ms . Parrish and Robert Wilcox ( as Paul Wilson ) are sweet , in the " romantic " adult roles . There are a myriad of extras , with Richard Selzer ( as Bud ) among the " worst dressed " background kids - later , Mr . Selzer became the " Top 10 " fashion conscious " Mr . Blackwell " .

453597	15896852	37120	8.0	Mrs . Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter	Mickey Rooney ( as Mi Taylor ) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin , where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor ( as Velvet Brown ) - - she adores horses , but he has a sad history with the animals . Ms . Taylor is enamored with Mr . Rooney's horse-sense ; she takes him home , and gets him room and board with her family . They are supported very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp ( as Mr . and Mrs . Brown ) . Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings . The plot of " National Velvet " is implausible to a fault ; for example , the circumstances leading to Taylor's ride in the " Big Race " are quite a stretch ( but were likely more believable on paper ) . Still , the characters ' connection to horses , and to Ms . Revere's character are nicely conceived . Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the starring roles ; there is a balance between Rooney's fading " child star " and Taylor's exuberant new " child star " , which adds depth to their characterizations . The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine direction , photography , and editing from Clarence Brown , Leonard Smith , and Robert Kern . A sentimental classic .

453167	15896852	418763	8.0	Every War Is Different , Every War Is the Same	Excellently described , on the DVD sleeve : " ' Jarhead ' ( the self-imposed moniker of the Marines ) follows Swoff ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty , where he sports a sniper rifle through Middle East deserts that provide no cover from the heat or Iraqi soldiers . Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully grasp . " Sam Mendes ' " Jarhead " very effectively captures the Humor , Fear , and Waiting of War - in this case , George H . Bush's 1991 " Desert Storm " to retrieve Kuwait from Iraq . Certainly , it helped to have adapted the story from participating Marine Anthony Swofford , who was " young and stupid " enough to have " got lost on his way to college , " and volunteered . Of course , neither " Swoff " nor his brothers are really " stupid " . The Marines may not possess knowledge about every subject under the desert sun , but they are human ; and , they are treated with dignity and respect in this film . Mr . Gyllenhaal , Peter Sarsgaard ( as Troy ) , Lucas Black ( as Kruger ) , Brian Geraghty ( as Fergus ) , Jacob Vargas ( as Cortez ) , Laz Alonso ( as Escobar ) , Evan Jones ( as Fowler ) , and Iván Fenyö ( as Pinko ) are a terrific Unit . Jamie Foxx ( as Sykes ) is a perfect Lifer . Keep an eye on Mr . Sarsgaard " Troy " characterization , for a " Best Supporting Actor " caliber performance . Mr . Jones ' " Fowler " is also letter-perfect . And , Roger Deakins ' photography is spectacular . One mistake the film makes is NOT developing some characters fully . Mr . Geraghty's " Fergus " and Mr . Fenyö's " Pinko " absolutely need more minutes on screen , considering their roles ; and , the direction is good enough to warrant a longer running time . A " Director's Cut " , or reading of the book , is necessary . The film doesn't just leave you wanting more , it needs more . Semper Fi , Mr . Swofford !

453015	15896852	39370	8.0	Opportunity Knocks for Loretta Young	Loretta Young plays a Swedish " Cinderella " who rises from poor Minnesota farm girl to potential Washington official . This is very much a " Star Vehicle " for Ms . Young , and she is remarkable - lifting the routine rags-to-riches story far above the expected . Some of the supporting players seem a little silly - maybe playing caricatures - but , Ethel Barrymore and Charles Bickford are recommended viewing ; and , Young is admirably assisted by Joseph Cotton as " leading man " . There were some surprises in the predictably - at one time , the film looks like it's going to end poorly , but turns around nicely . The production values are relatively high , so ignore the fake snow scene . Surprisingly , the behind-the-scenes political dealings pulled few punches , with Ms . Barrymore's presence strongly felt . A much better film than expected . The Farmer's Daughter ( 1947 ) H . C . Potter - Loretta Young , Joseph Cotten , Ethel Barrymore
452689	15896852	41472	8.0	Five Bowery Boys and a Baby	The habitually unemployed " Bowery Boys " are losers at the laundromat ; so , entrepreneurial Leo Gorcey ( as Slip Mahoney ) decides to " take in " laundry , using the spare room at father Bernard ( as " Louie " ) ' s Sweet Shop " . As usual , Mr . Gorcey is amusingly assisted by Huntz Hall ( as Sach De Bussy Jones ) , who fantasizes about " Cynthia " , his department store wax dummy girlfriend . William " Billy " Benedict ( as Whitey ) , Benny " Bennie " Bartlett ( as Butch ) , and David Gorcey ( as Chuck ) are also on hand . During the expected washing machine mishaps , a mysterious woman ( Anabel Shaw ) leaves a baby at " Mahoney Enterprises " . . . " Hold That Baby ! " finds the comedy team of Gorcey & Hall in fine form . Hall's scenes with " Cynthia " are a highlight , along with the entire " Midvale Sanitarium " sequence - watch as quick-thinking Gorcey passes Hall off as a nut-house hopeful , and poses as a bumbling doctor . The Charles R . Marion & George Schnitzer screenplay is excellent ; and , each Jan Grippo performer is perfectly cast , with the entire production running very smoothly . It's ably directed by Reginald Le Borg , and features particularly outstanding appearances by Ida Moore and Florence Auer ( as Faith and Hope Andrews ) , a delightfully greedy old duo .

452476	15896852	61107	8.0	Alfred Hitchcock Tears it Up	Paul Newman ( as Michael Armstrong ) and Julie Andrews ( as Sarah Sherman ) are celebrating an early honeymoon , under their bed covers ; it's a good way to stay warm while the Cold War rages , and heating systems fail . Ms . Andrews doesn't know it , but Mr . Newman is preparing to defect to the Soviet Bloc . Further explanation would spoil the plot , which takes both expected and unexpected turns . Alfred Hitchcock's " Tom Curtain " is masterfully directed ; and , the otherwise more sunnily disposed Newman and Andrews are surprisingly effective . Their lesser known supporting players are appropriately chilling - - especially the electrifying Wolfgang Kieling ( as Hermann Gromek ) ; his ghastly expiration scene is a classic . Mr . Hitchcock received a relative bad rap for his " Torn Curtain " ; as , understandably , reviewers held his films to increasingly difficult to attain expectations . Still , Hitchcock and crew create an extraordinary frosty , paranoiac Cold War spy chiller . The film might have been perfected with some additional characterization given for Newman and Andrews to work with ; either or both of their characters might have had an intriguing past relationship with , perhaps , the " Ballerina " ( Tamara Toumanova ) or the " Countess " ( Lila Kedrova ) . As it stands , Mr . Kieling and others have more interesting backgrounds than either of the leads .
453351	15896852	37280	8.0	Keep the Home Fires Burning	Faithful wife Claudette Colbert ( as Anne Hilton ) , and daughters Jennifer Jones ( as Jane Hilton ) and Shirley Temple ( as Bridget " Brig " Hilton ) keep the World War II home fires burning ? and burning ? and burning ? in David O . Selznick's eagerly awaited follow-up to his two extraordinary " Best Picture " Oscar winners : " Gone with the Wind " and " Rebecca " . " Since You Went Away " doesn't rate with those classics , but it does compare favorably with most other films released in 1944 . The cast is certainly " All-Star ! " - fronted by the teary performances of top actresses Claudette Colbert , Jennifer Jones , and Shirley Temple . Ms . Colbert and Ms . Jones characterize well . Ms . Temple is less effective ; although , scenes like the reading of her father's letter are nicely played . Temple was better as an actress , in fact , than in many of her more successful child roles ; and , she only falters when slipping too heavily into the old persona . Male support is provided by : Joseph Cotten ( as Tony Willett ) , a lieutenant who'd like to have had a go with Colbert ; Monty Woolley ( as William G . Smollett ) , a grandfatherly sage ; and , Robert Walker ( as William ' Bill ' Smollett II ) , a corporal who takes a liking to Jones . Off-screen , Jones was breaking up with Mr . Walker ( her husband ) , and taking up with Selznick . Agnes Moorehead ( as Emily Hawkins ) gives the film some much-needed friction , by going against the patriotic grain . And , Hattie McDaniel ( as Fidelio ) is charming in her updated " Mammy " role . Given the star-studded cast , it's surprising to see so little energy transmitted from the screen ; or , at least , not enough to justify the long running time . As an ensemble , the cast never quite coalesces . There is more energy transmitted in " cameo " roles by Lionel Barrymore , Guy Madison , and Nazimova . Mr . Madison , in his first film role , gives the film some sex appeal when he tries to pick up Jones in a bowling alley . Ms . Nazimova , in her last film role , recites an accented " Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ? " speech that gets to the point ( at last ) . The photography ( Stanley Cortez and Lee Garmes ) and music ( Max Steiner ) are beautiful . Cortez , Garmes , and director John Cromwell give the film a dark shadowy style ; and , many scenes , with sparse dialog , are magical . One of the best parts of the film occurs when Walker goes off to war , leaving Jones at a train station . Mr . Steiner's score is one of his most successful , and suitable ; it helped send several records , like " Together " , up the hit parade . Recommended for everyone with a 1940s wartime sensibility ( which was this film's intended audience ) . Otherwise , get yourself in the right frame of mind , and have a few hours to spare for " Since You Went Away " .

453524	15896852	17739	8.0	Stylish Spoofery of the Old Haunted House	Laura La Plante ( as Annabelle West ) and an assortment of greedy relatives gather at a Gothic Old Mansion to hear the reading of The Will . Relatively soon , we learn The Fortune will be inherited by young Ms . La Plante ; however , she must be declared Sane by a doctor - naturally , this is an incentive for someone to drive the dear girl Insane ! This is a stylishly shot silent " comedy / thriller " spoof of " haunted house " stories - like " The Bat " ( a 1920 play , and 1926 movie ) . La Plante and Creighton Hale ( as Paul Jones ) are okay as the nominal " leads " , but the veteran cast must have been much more amusing to the typical 1920s viewer . Tully Marshall ( as Mr . Crosby ) and Lucien Littlefield ( as the Doctor ) were two of the best supporting actors around , and Flora Finch ( as Aunt Susan ) must have been considered a film legend in 1927 - they are all a hoot , but Martha Mattox really steals the " The Cat and the Canary " with her terrific turn as haunted house hostess " Mammy Pleasant " ! Interestingly , this was an adaptation of a ( 1922 ) stage play - obviously " silent " films made much better movies out of plays than did later " sound " adaptations . Some may argue " sound " productions never figured out how to turn a good stage play into a good movie . Director Paul Leni and Gilbert Warrenton were among those making art ( more or less ) out of silent film . By the way , there is a scene with the possible " killer " walking in from the right of the screen ; but , this is not a " who-done-it " movie as much as it is a spoof of said ? The Cat and the Canary ( 1927 ) Paul Leni - Laura La Plante , Creighton Hale , Martha Mattox
453291	15896852	41716	8.0	New York , New York ! ( It's a Wonderful Town )	Three sailors spend their 24-hour shore leave looking for women in New York City . Gene Kelly ( he's Gabey ) finds Vera-Ellen ( she's Ivy ) , Betty Garrett ( she's Brunhilde ) finds Frank Sinatra ( he's Chip ) , and Jules Mushin ( he's Ozzie ) finds Ann Miller ( she's Claire ) . The movie opens with the extraordinary production number " New York ! New York ! " , with the Kelly , Sinatra , and Mushin trio dancing and singing all over New York City . It's one of the best musical introductions ever , and the New York City location footage is exquisite . You should know that , while the film is classy and energetic throughout , it never again even approaches the high standard exhibited in the opening . The exuberance is enough to sustain the film for some time - how long will depend on individual tastes . On the Town ( 1949 ) Gene Kelly , Stanley Donen - Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Ann Miller
453182	15896852	21542	8.0	All Quiet on the Westfront 1918	It is incredible that the U . S . and Germany , in between two Great World Wars , would simultaneously produce two very similarly-themed films - this one , and " All Quiet on the Western Front " ( 1930 ) . The sounds of war are eerily alike - relentless , disturbing , horrifying ? " Westfront 1918 " is less drama , and more documentary-style than its cousin . The war scenes are remarkable ; but so is an interlude when Gustav Diessl ( as Karl ) goes on leave , expertly directed by G . W . Pabst . This part is slightly better than the Lew Ayres ( as Paul ) leave in " All Quiet on the Western Front " ; and , it is more realistic . However , " Westfront 1918 " is less memorable in its final " emotion grabbing " scene ( and , overall ) . Still , it's an excellent film . Westfront 1918 ( 1930 ) G . W .

Ms . Lynley has arrived from America , to join her London-based journalist brother , Mr . Dullea . After some shopping , Lynley goes to pick up her daughter from school , but ? " Bunny Lake Is Missing " . Soon , sleuthing Laurence Olivier ( as Inspector Newhouse ) arrives to investigate the disappearing child ; but , unexpectedly , he has trouble finding evidence " Bunny Lake " has ever existed . Director Otto Preminger artfully holds interest , as his psychological thriller gets creepy on you . Lynley and Dullea are quite effective , and intriguing , as the oddly coupled siblings . Olivier is as arresting as ever . Hindsight will prove the story cheats ; however , it doesn't deter from the viewing pleasure . The supporting cast is fantastic . Noel Coward ( as Horatio Wilson ) is the reddest herring around , but highly amusing . Martita Hunt ( as Aida Ford ) is delightful as the frightfully intuitive woman upstairs . The sets and photography ( Denys N . Coop ) are terrific . And , you can't beat The Zombies , performing " Remember You " , " Just Out of Reach " , and " Nothing's Changed " . Cheers ! Bunny Lake Is Missing ( / 65 ) Otto Preminger - Carol Lynley , Keir Dullea , Laurence Olivier
453697	15896852	43560	8.0	Richard Basehart Goes Out on a Ledge	After passing on a hotel waiter's delivery of breakfast , troubled young Richard Basehart ( as Robert Cosick ) steps out on the ledge of a New York City hotel , and threatens to jump . Fifteen floors down , he is spotted by beat street policeman Paul Douglas ( as Charlie Dunnigan ) . As a multitude of onlookers , punsters , policeman , and media crowd around , officer Douglas tries to talk " loopy " Mr . Basehart off the ledge . Basehart's psyche is made more insightful through conversations with Douglas , and a parade of interested parties ; including self-centered mother Agnes Moorehead ( as Christine Hill Cosick ) , henpecked father Robert Keith ( as Paul E . Cosick ) , and wholesome ex-girlfriend Barbara Bel Geddes ( as Virginia Foster ) . Director Henry Hathaway's " Fourteen Hours " milks billowing curtains and skyline angles for all they are worth , registering a great amount of anxiety for his " Man on the Ledge " . Fidgeting and ghostly , Basehart is terrific as the psychotic suicide hopeful who states , " Life stinks . " Douglas is a perfect good-natured contrast , who tries to explain life's worth in family homilies ( which are impossible for Basehart to understand ) . Both actors had underrated careers . Happily , Basehart won the National Board of Review's 1951 " Best Actor " award for his ledge work . Interestingly , Jan Sterling won the Board's 1951 " Best Actress " award for " Ace in the Hole " , which also dramatized a " breathtaking spectacle " . In subplots , love blossoms for handsome Jeffrey Hunter & pretty Debra Paget ( as Danny & Ruth ) , while Grace Kelly & James Warren ( as Mr . & Mrs . Fuller ) struggle with impending divorce . These stories don't add or subtract much from the main event - Will Basehart jump , or won't he ? - It might have been interesting and artful for writer John Paxton to parallel Ms . Kelly's marriage woes with Ms . Moorehead's early life and marriage ; the sense of generational doom would be left open-ended , with the future resting with Hunter and Paget . By the way , the cast of thousands includes dozens of " bit " players worth connecting with ( I started with switchboard-ready Sandra Gould of " Bewitched " , and found something right from George Putnam ) . Fourteen Hours ( / 51 ) Henry Hathaway - Richard Basehart , Paul Douglas , Barbara Bel Geddes
453676	15896852	9109	8.0	The Boy Who Went to War	At the end of the U . S . Civil War , the well-named " Monsieur France " ( Adolph Lestina ) moved to his father's home in France , rather than submit to the Yankees . Boasting he is " the only citizen of the Confederate States of America , " he sits by his old Confederate flag , dreaming of a time gone with the wind . Mr . Lestina lives with his exuberant granddaughter Carol Dempster ( as Atoline France ) . Ms . Dempster catches the eye of Richard Barthelmess ( as Ralph Grey ) , the older brother of a school chum ; but , Mr . Barthelmess is too late in his courting - - and , so , Dempster gets herself betrothed to Syn De Conde ( as the Count de Brissac ) . Then , Dempster goes to visit the " Grey " family in New York . In New York , Dempster meets Barthelmess ' younger brother , Robert Harron ( as James Grey ) . Mr . Harron is more interested in continuing a partying lifestyle than settling down ; he gives Dempster the once over , but finds singer-dancer Clarine Seymour ( as Cutie Beautiful ) more fetching . Ms . Seymour shares Harron's interest in youthful Ragtime fun . Although their father is against the Great War ( aka World War I ) , Barthelmess and Harron eventually join in the fighting . Will the two brothers get out of the war alive , and return to the women they left behind ? Harron effortlessly steals the film , with his portrayal of the slouching , partying brother who becomes a war hero ; Seymour is also delightful as his 31st conquest , and true love . That Harron's performance so outdistances the other players may be why director D . W . Griffith , as the film progresses , devotes more screen time Harron's character . In hindsight , a re-titled , re-edited " The Girl Who Stayed at Home " would have been improved by scenes from Harron's college days , and his contrasting relationship with brother Barthelmess . Old Confederate rebel Lestina's final acceptance of the United States of America is a nice touch . The Girl Who Stayed at Home ( / 19 ) D . W . Griffith - Carol Dempster , Richard Barthelmess , Robert Harron
453561	15896852	2408	8.0	Rich Man , Poor Man , Beggar Man , Thief	Early film , beautifully directed by D . W . Griffith . Two young couples are happily married , on the same day : one is rich , Blanche Sweet and Edwin August ; the other is poor , Dorothy Bernard and Charles West . As their wedded lives unfold , we see the desperation of the poor couple contrasted with the opulent lifestyle of the rich couple . The poor husband cannot find work , and is tempted to rob a house . The rich husband is tempted to take a bribe . Each succumbs to temptation . When the poor man attempts to rob the rich man , their lives again collide ? Griffith expertly cross-cuts between the parallel lives - the rich and the poor couples , bringing them together , and tearing them apart . G . W . Bitzer's photography is stunning , highlighted by a cooperative wind . The scenes with the poor husband looking for work are very well done . Griffith and the four principals ( Sweet , West , August , and Bernard ) very effectively use body and expression to convey their means . Griffith expertly uses the camera and the characters to relay his message about " white collar crime " in " One Is Business , the Other Crime " . Sweet . One Is Business , the Other Crime ( 1912 ) D . W . Griffith - Blanche Sweet , Charles West , Edwin August
452741	15896852	45124	8.0	Sweating it Out with Broderick Crawford	Watch Crawford sweat this one out ! Great fun with Broderick Crawford as managing editor of a " Scandal Sheet " newspaper , with John Derek and Donna Reed on staff as reporters . The film uses the technique of showing the murderer's identity as the crime is committed ( it's editor Crawford ) ; then we watch him squirm as the reporter hero ( Derek ) and heroine ( Reed ) try to identify the killer and cover the story . Mr . Crawford must give the " Lonely Heart Killer " big coverage in his tabloid newspaper , or risk suspicion . When a possible witness turns up , things get complicated . Henry O'Neill is great as a washed-up old drunk who used to work for Crawford's newspaper . The film has a great style ? beautiful black and white photography directed by Phil Karlson . Recommended viewing ! Scandal Sheet ( 1952 ) Phil Karlson - Broderick Crawford , John Derek , Donna Reed
452824	15896852	32022	8.0	John Garfield Gets in the Ring for Billy Halop and " The Dead End Kids "	After winning a championship fight , boxer John Garfield ( as Johnnie Bradfield ) celebrates with a drinking binge , which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter . Although his manager killed the man , Mr . Garfield is blamed . When the manager dies in a car crash , wearing Garfield's stolen watch , authorities think the boxer is dead . Still a WANTED man , Garfield changes his identity to " Jack Dorney " and moves to an Arizona ranch . There , Garfield meets " The Dead End Kids " : Billy Halop ( as Tommy ) , Bobby Jordan ( as Angel ) , Leo Gorcey ( as Spit ) , Huntz Hall ( as Dippy ) , Gabriel Dell ( as T . B . ) , and Bernard Punsly ( as Milt ) . Garfield bonds with the young " Dead End " lads , who were sent to stay with sweet " Grandma Rafferty " ( May Robson ) as an alternative to reform school , courtesy of her brother , deceased priest " Father Rafferty " . Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister , pretty " Peggy " ( Gloria Dickson ) , who is there to keep any eye on the kids . Of course , Garfield's past comes back to haunt him ? " John Garfield and The ' Dead End ' Kids " make beautiful ( Max Steiner ) music together , thanks to effective direction and photography , by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe . The story is predictably comfortable , with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form . Garfield and the " Dead End " kids are a winning combination ; although Garfield made no further movies with the " East Side " gang , the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan , almost immediately , for " Dust Be My Destiny " . The boxing scenes are nicely staged . But , the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the New York " Kids " ( Halop , Jordan , Hall , and Punsly ) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger . Other , more brief , highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan ( as Goldie ) , boozy Barbara Pepper ( as Budgie ) , and young Ronald Sinclair ( as Douglas ) losing at strip poker .

453014	15896852	41239	8.0	In the Ring with Kirk Douglas	Kirk Douglas delivers an astonishing performance as rags-to-riches boxer . " Champion " is a dark film , told in flashback . The main feature is Mr . Douglas ' performance , but it also works as a " boxing film " - however , don't expect Douglas's character or the film to be typical 1940s Hollywood film . This is a film which raises questions about this " sport " and others . It's well written ( for the time ) and directed Mark Robson . There are some other good performances ; in particular , Arthur Kennedy as Douglas ' brother ; when the story first flashbacked , the two actors were very believable as brothers . This kind of drama might seem a little tired , at times , because it's been done so many times since , and the scenario is ( or , has become ) so predictable . Oh , and you have to just go along with Douglas and Kennedy being named " Midge " and " Connie " . Champion ( 1949 ) Mark Robson - Kirk Douglas , Arthur Kennedy , Ruth Roman
452354	15896852	37469	8.0	An Imaginative Portrait	Joan Bennett reigns supreme as " The Woman in the Window " , and Edward G . Robinson is superb as the man whom she invites over to see her sketches . Under Fritz Lang's direction , they are a magical team . I was as captivated by their performances as they were captivated by each other . The story , however , is somewhat of a letdown . I don't think the flaws are enough to mar thoroughly enjoying the film ; it's sad , though , to watch an potentially extraordinary film falter . Mr . Robinson and Ms . Bennett are greatly supported by Raymond Massey and Dan Duryea . Mr . Duryea's supporting performance is particularity effective . Mr . Massey is close behind ( but certainly no " Colombo " ) .

The tiny city of " Perfection , Nevada " suddenly finds its population of 14 dwindling , as under-employed handymen Kevin Bacon ( as Valentine " Val " McKee ) and Fred Ward ( as Earl Bassett ) decide to hit the road . Before heading to nearby " Bixby " , they meet perky student seismologist Finn Carter ( as Rhonda LeBeck ) . Ms . Carter is studying an odd abundance of seismic " Tremors " in the vicinity . Driving on , Mr . Bacon and Mr . Ward discover giant mole-like slug creatures are eating all animals ( including people , of course ) in the area . They high-tail it back to town and , with the remaining citizens , try to avoid becoming food for slugs . Director Ron Underwood , with writers S . S . Wilson and Brent Maddock , creates a great balance of humor , suspense , and horror show " homage " . The flesh-eating " graboids " are a great " monster " - but , the real success in " Tremors " is the dignified performances of the cast , led by Bacon's keenly characterized " Valentine " . Bacon , Ward , and the others play the cartoonish characters with wit rather than foolishness . As usual , the excitement is enhanced when the characters are appealing . Michael Gross and Reba McEntire ( as Burt and Heather Gummer ) are an absolute hoot . Tremors ( 1990 ) Ron Underwood - Kevin Bacon , Fred Ward , Finn Carter
453472	15896852	18054	8.0	If I Were a Carpenter	Cecil B . De Mille's EPIC " The King of Kings " is his New Testament follow-up to the Old Testament EPIC " The Ten Commandments " ( 1923 ) . These films are better than their sound-era re-makes ; their lack of spoken dialog makes them seem more reverent , somehow . DeMille even promises this , " play ( is ) a reverent part in the spirit of ( Christ's ) great command . " To introduce his version of Jesus Christ ( H . B . Warner ) , " The King of Kings " heals a blind girl - as the girl opens her eyes , Mr . Warner becomes the Christian sin-savior . It's one of many marvelous bits of film-making . For its time , this was a very artistic , well-produced film . In a foreword to accompany this picture , DeMille wrote , " At no time in the world's history has humanity so hungered for the Truth . Science has declared there is a God . And a groping , eager World cries , ' How may we find Him ? ' The answer goes back two thousand years , to a Man who stood with a little band of ragged followers in the midst of bigotry , cruelty and ignorance - lighting with the torch of His own life the flame of hope in the heart of man and showing us by sublime Sacrifice - Death and Resurrection - our own Immortality . " DeMille takes liberties with the story , but doesn't waver too far from what could have happened in the lives of the characters . For example , since the affairs of Mary Magdalene ( Jacqueline Logan ) aren't explicitly documented , DeMille ( with writer Jeanie Macpherson ) creates one , to introduce and move the story along . With a prominently jeweled bust , Ms . Logan's " Mary " meets Christ after learning her lover , Judas Iscariot ( Joseph Schildkraut ) , is spending too much time with the Divine one . But , in casting an older man as Christ , DeMille helps avoid possibly making Christ appear too erotic . The film benefits from some story tinkering ; however , it still plays like a series of stilted vignettes - most of the time . One of the more memorable moments occurs when a girl asks Christ to " heal " her doll's broken leg . This simple scene stands out , due to its lack of miraculous content . The " special effects " highlight in " King of Kings " is the rollicking crucifixion ; and , like " Ten Commandments " , some color footage is included . Watch closely , and you'll see the character " Judas " steal the picture ; and , overall , Mr . Schildkraut's hanging disciple is the film's most memorable character .

453063	15896852	10418	8.0	Thomas Meighan's an Admirable Crichton	Thomas Meighan ( as the admirable Crichton ) is head butler for an aristocratic British family ; he is obviously quite taken with luscious Gloria Swanson ( as Lady Mary Lasenby ) , but unable to cross class barriers . The household's scullery maid Lila Lee ( as Tweeny ) is in love with Crichton . The threesome , and some others , go out yachting ; when cross currents hit , the ensemble is shipwrecked ! Turns out , the servant class has far more advanced survival skills . Who knew ? Ms . Swanson is the film's main attraction ; her bathing and showering scenes , near the beginning of the film , helped clean-up at the box office . Note that whenever there is nakedness afoot , DeMille has an object cover-up Swanson's figure , however . Though not as famed , Swanson's later wet spot , when she is nearly drowned in the bowel of the sideswiped yacht , is far superior . Swanson and Ms . Lee perform well , actually , with the material given . Loved the " upper crust " lady complaining about limp toast ! Mr . Meighan delivers the movie's finest performance ; the other players have moments , but Meighan is outstanding in the pivotal role of Butler Crichton . From the moment he checks the mansion for dust , he is delightful ; the actor makes the movie even more interesting when the suppressed desire for Swanson begins registering on his face . A couple of smaller roles are noteworthy : Wesley Barry is great as the peeping Buttons , indicating what Cecil B . DeMille's " Male and Female " is really all about ( more or less ) . You should also keep an eye on Bebe Daniels during the " King of Babylon " imaginary sequence ; she is terrific as Meighan's right-hand lady . Silent film veterans Guy Oliver and Clarence Burton inexplicably disappear , after the shipwreck . Theodore Roberts and Raymond Hatton are around much longer , thankfully . The film is recommended , and DeMille obviously expert - but it's one of the more ludicrously-themed silent era classics preserved for modern scrutiny . Apparently , in adapting " The Admirable Crichton " for DeMilledom , the director substituted sex for satire . AND , he gets his titillating re-title " Male and Female " from no less than God Himself ! quoting , " So God created Man in His own image , in the image of God created He him : Male and Female created He them . " There is also a oddly placed bow to the good ol ' U . S . A . With all its oddities , it's still a fun film . Male and Female ( / 19 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Thomas Meighan , Gloria Swanson , Lila Lee
453244	15896852	8406	8.0	Norma Talmadge Makes an Impression	That this film was reportedly shown at Venice ( presumably , in conjunction with the summer's Film Festival ) in 1958 makes the possibility of someday seeing " Panthea " tantalizing . Norma Talmadge died in December , 1957 , which would seem to confirm that the film was screened , possibly as a tribute to Ms . Talmadge . So , what happened to this print of " Panthea " ? After impressive performances in " A Daughter's Strange Inheritance " ( 1915 ) and " The Battle Cry of Peace " ( 1915 ) , Talmadge began her reign as one of the most acclaimed actresses of the entire silent era . She won a 1915 " Motion Picture Magazine " award as best " Character Woman " for the year ( the unusual distinction being the way they differentiated an " Actress " from a " Star " back then ) . Talmadge was a popular " Triangle " player in 1916 . But , the 1917 release of " Panthea " established her as a superstar ( with help from producer-lover Joseph M . Schenck , director Alan Dwan , and photographer Harold Rosson ) . Contemporary critics lavished praise on " Panthea " . Julian Johnson called it " one of the best photoplays in screen history , " despite an " ineffective " ending , in " Photoplay " magazine ( April 1917 ) , explaining , " Norma Talmadge plays Panthea with a verve , abandon and surety which denominates her queen of our younger silver-sheet emotionalists . There is no woman on the depthless stage who can flash from woe to laughter and back again ( like ) Talmadge . She is 100 % surefire . Rogers Lytton , as the Baron , surpasses all his other efforts . Earle Foxe plays Gerald in psychopathic correctness . " Fortunately , the number of lost Talmadge film reels is not as extensive as was once believed . An impressive number are known to exist ( search Greta de Groat's website for an excellent listing ) ; but , they are in need of restoration . The reason so few of Talmadge's films are available , presently , appears to be due to lack of interest ( and funds ) . Hopefully , someone will locate films like " Panthea " ( 1917 ) , and restore Talmadge's acclaimed " Smilin ' Through " ( 1922 ) . Panthea ( / 17 ) Alan Dwan - Norma Talmadge , Earle Foxe , L .

452707	15896852	57063	8.0	When Sandy Met Flipper	Chuck Connors ( as Porter Ricks ) lives on the Florida coast , with his 12-year-old son Luke Halpin ( as Sandy ) , and wife Kathleen Maguire ( as Martha ) . Following a hurricane , son Halpin goes to bail out a dingy ; and , he is startled when a dolphin jumps out - - it's Flipper ! As it introduces an enduring franchise , the first " Flipper " effortlessly overcomes its flaws - - mainly , parts that go on too long , and look more repetitive and ordinary in hindsight . The catchy theme song , for example , will soon be improved upon , and given its logical place over the credits . The film opens with an exciting hurricane , and features beautiful location and underwater photography throughout . If you know Flipper , the film offers many origin story " firsts " , topped by the meeting of Sandy and Flipper . Pete the Pelican is around , along with many familiar elements . The Ricks family line-up is different , however - - mother Maguire is present , but no Bud . The " Flipper " character is played by " Mitzie " , and others , undoubtedly . The " A Boy and His Dolphin " concept is terrific , and the Flipper character retains its integrity through ensuing years . Halpin is very cute , and seems to improve his performance over the run of the film ; his cavorting scenes are charming . Mr . Connors and Ms . Maguire are great parents - - they make up MUCH more natural family than expected . Joe Higgins ( who also appears in the next " Flipper " ) and Jane Rose ( who also appears in the first " Dark Shadows " ) are among the supporting players . Note that Connors ' friend , who dies during the hurricane , is mentioned as " not of our faith " ; this add depths to the film . Flipper ( 1963 ) James B .

453309	15896852	45216	8.0	Weird Scenes Inside a Boy's Mind	" Talk About a Stranger " is a much , much better film that you might expect . Despite the credits order , it stars Billy Gray ( as Robert " Bud " Fontaine Jr . ) . Mr . Gray would , later , become best known as another " Bud " , on the TV series " Father Knows Best " . In this film , he plays a boy who adopts a stray dog , which he names " Boy " ; then , he finds the dog has been poisoned . Gray suspects a mysterious new arrival in town , Kurt Kasznar ( as Matlock ) . Mr . Kasznar acts , and looks , very much like an outsider ; and , he seems to dislike " Boy " , and children ? Gray does a fine job in a difficult role ; he has to play the boy as both unlikeable , and likable . The character " Bud " is redeemed ( or , made sympathetic ) by his caring for his dead " Dog " ; and , the film effectively captivates , with its plot developments . Kasznar is great , as usual ; he keeps the performance from going in a direction not in tune with the film's ending . Top billed George Murphy and Nancy Davis ( as parents Robert and Marge Fontaine ) are ordinary ; undoubtedly , they are better appreciated in other films . Later , Ms . Davis was , of course , wonderfully cast as the second Mrs . Ronald Reagan . The film's weaknesses might have been arrested by strengthening the " Fontaine " family . The other players in " Talk About a Stranger " are terrific . Lewis Stone is at least as " fatherly " as Mr . Murphy ; he plays the newspaperman ( William J . Wardlaw ) Gray runs to for help . Teddy Infuhr has a great little part as a boy who lives near a " Haunted House " Gray visits ; watch for their scene in the " San Sala " house . The film is full of weird scenes ; and , Gray's trip to " San Sala " is one . Note , also , that Gray is picked up hitchhiking by motorcycling sailor Alvy Moore , who immediately asks Gray if he has a sister ! Mr . Moore will , later , become best known as " Hank Kimball " on the TV series " Green Acres " . You also get to see Kathleen Freeman , Burt Mustin , and some others ? Cinematographer John Alton is the film's most valuable player . Mr . Alton , David Bradley ( director ) , Cedric Gibbons ( art director ) , and Eddie Imazu ( art director ) make " Talk About a Stranger " a great looking film . For this , and its cast , " Talk About a Stranger " is well worth watching . Talk About a Stranger ( 1952 ) David Bradley - Billy Gray , Kurt Kasznar , Lewis Stone

" Mr . von Sydow is immediately confronted by creepy , black-cloaked Bengt Ekerot ( as the Personification of Death ) , who has appeared to claim von Sydow's soul . Instead of going quietly into the final night , von Sydow challenges Mr . Ekerot to a game of chess . " Death " is in a playful mood , and accepts the contest ; if von Sydow wins , he and his friends may avoid the Plague . Director Ingmar Bergman had an amazing 1957 ( in Sweden , anyway ) , book-ended with " Det sjunde inseglet " ( " The Seventh Seal " ) and " Smultronstället " ( " Wild Strawberries " ) . The latter film definitely has the edge , story-wise . Still , the former is full of beautifully morbid images , killer camera-work from Bergman and Gunnar Fischer , accompanying a thought-provoking script . Von Sydow and the cast , including Bibi Andersson ( as Mia ) and Nils Poppe ( as Jof ) are great . Ms . Andersson's preparation of some " wild strawberries " seems to portend the next film .

Renfro is working on eradicating the remnants of his Hungarian accent ( his " th " sound ) . Meanwhile , slick disc jockey Kevin Bacon ( as Billy Magic ) arrives in town ( one step ahead of the law ) , to spin " sweaty collar and dirty fingernail music " on the local rock ' n ' roll radio station . Mr . Bacon is a payola player , who needs an underage kid to handle money illegal exchanges . When Renfro cheats on a radio contest , Bacon offers him big bucks to serve as " unwitting accomplice " ? Bacon swaggers through his role with perfection . And , Renfro is incredible , in a very difficult role ; capturing the vulnerability of youth , as he struggles to both adopt and resist Bacon's seductive persona . Calista Flockhart ( as Diney Majeski ) is very effective , as Renfro's " older woman " love interest . Their performances should have received some award consideration . Maximilian Schell ( as Istvan Jonas ) would have been more believable as Renfro's grandfather , to support the obviously wider than envisioned cultural gap between the characters . A few of the scenes are silly , but many more work , due to director Guy Ferland and his convincing cast . " I make things up sometimes , " Renfro reveals . Don't we all . " Telling Lies in America " certainly breaks no new ground - but , it revisits cinematic themes in great style . The film builds to a fine conclusion , and the music is terrific .

452784	15896852	8519	8.0	Strawberry Flats Forever	Mary Pickford ( as Jenny Lawrence ) finds herself all alone in New England , after the elder Mrs . Lawrence dies ; so , she moves to the " Gold Rush " state of California , to live with her uncle . What she doesn't know ( initially ) is that her uncle has been killed by Indians ( Native Americans ) ; and , outlaw Elliott Dexter ( as " Black " Brown ) has assumed his identity . Arriving in the little mining town of Strawberry Flats , Ms . Pickford discovers Mr . Dexter's charade , and learns of her uncle's death . Dexter demands Pickford pretend she's his niece ; and , with nowhere to go , Pickford agrees . First and foremost , Dexter and Pickford are marvelous in the lead roles . Dexter begins to amaze when , in a barroom scene , he rescues Pickford from the advances of Raymond Hatton ( as Dick Roland ) . Pickford performed nicely when first entering her shabby new home , but becomes amazing when waking in the shed up as a wolf howls ? the two exude an unmistakable sexuality in their earliest scenes together , assisted by fine light and shadows direction from Cecil B . DeMille ( and , watch how the camera places their hands in a couple of scenes ) . As the film moves along , it loses focus on some of the sensuality , unfortunately . A subtle scene showing the leads ' passion would have been nice . Joining Hatton , supporting players Charles Ogle ( as Jim Lyn , who dates Pickford ) , Tully Marshall ( as barman Sam Sparks ) , and Walter Long ( as the Sheriff ) are entertaining . Pickford's last minute way of getting the townfolk to reconsider Dexter's fate is ingenious . The fact that " twenty men are fooled by one small woman " was nicely put , especially since it involved a doll given to Dexter's so-called " little girl " !

453226	15896852	57197	8.0	Gods and Monsters	In order to claim his rightful throne , Todd Armstrong ( as Jason ) must find the legendary Golden Fleece ; the assembled " Jason and the Argonauts " assume the quest , but are stymied by a series of monstrous obstacles . Behind the scenes , the Greek Gods ( led by Zeus and Hera ) are fighting over the mission's outcome . The heroic Mr . Armstrong also catches the eyes of mortals Gary Raymond ( as Acastus ) and Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) , but ? for different reasons . Ray Harryhausen's special effects are outstanding ; especially noteworthy are the dueling skeletons near the film's end - - and , the " stop motion animation " is excellent throughout . The skeleton sequence , and others , like the statue of Talos " coming-to-life " , are classic . Armstrong portrays the hero " Jason " handsomely , while Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) and Honor Blackman ( as Hera ) add feminine charm . Don Chaffey ( director ) and Bernard Herrmann ( musician ) also excel . The supporting cast and crew is stronger than you'd expect in a film of this type ; Mr . Raymond is the best supporting actor , with his clear , focused characterization of " Acastus " . Raymond's underrated performance provides some unexpected dramatic tension - - note how he calculatingly observes Armstrong , catching both the hero and the viewer off-guard . Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) Don Chaffey - Todd Armstrong , Gary Raymond , Nancy Kovack
453420	15896852	26029	8.0	The Man Who Knew Too Little	Alfred Hitchcock directs Robert Donat ( as Richard Hannay ) to a London music hall , where he joins the crowd enjoying the " Mr . Memory " show . A commotion erupts , and Mr . Donat finds himself in the company of a mysterious , beautiful woman . The woman ( Lucie Mannheim ) asks to be taken to Donat's flat , asking , " May I come home with you ? " Then , she is stabbed by spy types . Of course , Donat is suspected . While on the lamb , he meets cool blonde Madeleine Carroll ( as Pamela ) . . . " The 39 Steps " is an fine representation of 1930s Hitchcock ; although , the director more finely tuned some of the craft evident as his career developed . Some Hitchcock touches I found amusing were : the train men reviewing progress in the development of women's undergarments , and handcuffed Donat and Madeleine Carroll enjoying a sandwich while she removes her stockings . Hitchcock elicits nice performances ; with John Laurie ( as John ) and Peggy Ashcroft ( as Margaret ) standing out , in particularly effective characterizations . Early on , the film is reminiscent enough of Greta Garbo's " The Mysterious Lady " ( 1928 ) to invite some comparison . The 39 Steps ( 1935 ) Alfred Hitchcock - Robert Donat , Madeleine Carroll , Peggy Ashcroft
452623	15896852	10635	8.0	Wallace Reid Speeds into the Box Office Lead	Car salesman Wallace Reid ( as Walter Thomas " Toodles " Walden ) wants to win the triple crown in a big auto race . His boss , Theodore Roberts ( as J . D . " The Bear " Ward ) , has won two of the three races , and thinks Mr . Reid may muss up the company's winning streak . Roberts decides to test Reid's mettle ; but , the plan backfires , and his crack-car salesman quits . Meanwhile , Reid courts Roberts ' daughter , Ann Little ( as Dorothy " The Cub " Ward ) . She is the only thing Reid wants more than winning the big race ; however , Roberts wants her to wait five years before wedding . Can Reid win both the big race and the girl ? Scenery and cigar chewing Roberts threatens to steal the film from its star ; but the likable Reid overtakes Roberts after a contest to see who can pound his desk hardest . In jail for speeding , Reid memorably asks a rat , " How fast were you going ? " Car and train racing along the Los Angeles and San Francisco locale provided an exciting ending ; at one point , the car and train might collide ! " The Roaring Road " brought in box office returns at great speed ; and , Reid quickly became the # 1 United States Box Office star ; understandably , several follow-up films raced into theaters , including outright sequel " Excuse My Dust ! " ( 1920 ) .
453376	15896852	20269	8.0	When Love Comes Stealing	London " Piccadilly Club " proprietor Jameson Thomas ( as Valentine Wilmot ) is having an affair with the female half of his star dancing duo " Mabel and Vic " , shimmying Gilda Gray ( as Mabel " Mab " Greenfield ) . When Ms . Gray's dancing partner gets too amorous with his lady love , Mr . Thomas fires the man . Alas , the departing Cyril Ritchard ( as Victor " Vic " Smiles ) was the nightclub duo's main attraction , and business tanks . But , Thomas has discovered a new dancer in his kitchen , sexy scullery maid Anna May Wong ( as Shosho ) . Ms . Wong becomes an immediate sensation . Older Gray feels put out , especially when Thomas slips easily into the younger Wong's arms . Eventually , passion leads to murder . Director E . A . Dupont and photographer Werner Brandes are superb , in their final collaboration ; they give " Piccadilly " a great , artful style . Wong's performance , the last of her " silent " career , is almost revelatory ; and , it's at least " Supporting Actress " award-worthy . Higher-billed Gray handles her less flattering role well , too . And , Thomas meets Wong's subtlety in wonderful ways ; catch him admiring Wong's torn stockings . Small bits of business , like Mr . Ritchard slitting a deeper crease into his hat , suggest additional eroticism . Charles Laughton has a delicious cameo as a " Piccadilly Club " patron more interested in his food than the dancers . The film is not without its sour notes , however ; for example , some characterizations / relationships are poorly defined ; and , the ending could have been better . However , any attempt to improve " Piccadilly " might have encouraged the producers to fix things that weren't broken . Even the fly crawling up Wong's left arm as she reclines , during a seduction scene , seems magically planned .
453606	15896852	55184	8.0	Bottoms Up ! ( ? or Meat Is Murder ? )	In Reno , Nevada , voluptuous Marilyn Monroe ( as Roslyn Taber ) obtains a divorce ; then , she attracts the attention of three boozing cowboys : Clark Gable ( as Gay Langland ) , Montgomery Clift ( as Perce Howland ) , and Eli Wallach ( as Guido ) . Mr . Gable emerges as Ms . Monroe's ( and the film's ) leading man ; he leads the group on a hunting quest for flesh , explaining , " Nothing can live unless something dies . " Mr . Clift and Mr . Wallach agree with Gable . But , sensitive Monroe believes meat is murder . So , apparently , does Monroe's motherly landlady Thelma Ritter ( as Isabelle Steers ) ; however , she begs off the expedition early on , to join an ex-husband . The cast is extraordinary ; and , adding director John Huston and writer Arthur Miller to the mix guarantees a very interesting motion picture experience . " The Misfits " falls short , but not by much . Despite the fact that Mr . Miller must have written the story with Monroe ( then , his wife ) in mind , the main character is played by Gable - that is , if you consider the fact that his character undergoes the greatest transformation , in reaction to Monroe's character . And , Gable , performs the part very nicely . More importantly , he displays a dramatic , " modern " acting prowess , which might have served him well through the 1960s . Of course , that potential went unrealized when Gable suddenly died . In part , his heart attack was attributed to Gable's work in " The Misfits " . This is one film where the personal lives of the cast , director , and writer adversely affects what you see on the screen . The most " negative " result is Monroe's characterization ; she obviously needed more time with the role . Watch , for example , the scene with Monroe and Ritter , which plays after Gable walks off calling his dog ( " Tom Dooley " ) . As the women turn a corner , Monroe has to steady herself . It's a slight , almost unnoticeable misstep ; and , honestly , one which should have been re-shot . Probably , Monroe was so often indisposed , Mr . Huston had to do the best with what he had . It's a shame , because Monroe's acting is not at all inadequate . A particularly good moment to watch for is her " truck ride " , with Wallach ; in this scene , Monroe is exceptional . Another good scene includes Monroe using her real voice , listen to her say , " I don't care about the lettuce ! " At other times , Monroe appears very disconnected ; often , she seems to be acting alongside , rather than with , her co-stars . Gable , Monroe , Clift , and Ritter are certainly convincing as heavy drinkers . Interestingly , Clift uses his " personal demons " to good acting advantage ; whatever he was going through , privately , fit the character ; and , he manages to essay the film's most consistently convincing performance . If " The Misfits " were more successful , Clift might have been nominated as a " Best Supporting Actor " for his role . Also award-worthy is Alex North's perfect musical score . The ending lines , uttered by Gable and Monroe , are quite touching . . . indeed , the stars are out tonight . The Misfits ( 1961 ) John Huston - Clark Gable , Marilyn Monroe , Montgomery Clift
452992	15896852	31826	8.0	Earl of the Ring	Purported to be the story of a real Queen ( Elizabeth ) and Earl ( Essex ) , " Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex " is difficult to believe . Something is wrong with either the actors ' or characters ' motivations ; in this , the story of their " Love / Hate " relationship . The background story , involving armies and such , is really just there to add characterization . BUT , that does not mean the film fails ; in fact , it's very entertaining . Take it as an opportunity to enjoy leads Bette Davis and Errol Flynn deliver exciting performances . Interestingly , Ms . Davis portrays an aging , plain woman ; and Mr . Flynn is her young , beautiful lover . Their words make the situation believable , despite the strange plot and lack of passion . The supporting cast is chock FULL of other recognizable and delightful actors - - with Olivia de Havilland adding some lustful looks . Suspend the questions about how the characters ' motivations could possibly happen ; and , how events like Flynn's army becoming powerless in an instant could possible occur - - this is a film for appreciators of director Michael Curtiz ' cast . AND , a reversal of the more typical Older Man / Young Beauty gender roles . The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex ( 1939 ) Michael Curtiz - Bette Davis , Errol Flynn , Olivia de Havilland
453307	15896852	24115	8.0	Have You Ever Seen the Rain ?	Richard Barthelmess ( as Tom Holmes ) is serving in the Great War ( World War I ) , with buddy Gordon Westcott ( as Roger Winston ) . When Mr . Westcott shows cowardice during an important assignment , Mr . Barthelmess heroically completes the mission . However , Barthelmess is wounded ; and , he is taken prisoner by the Germans . Westcott assumes Barthelmess is dead , and takes credit for completing the mission . Meanwhile , Barthelmess is given morphine by German doctors ; after the war , he returns to the United States , but has become a drug addict . Westcott helps Barthelmess out by getting him a job in his father's bank . Naturally , a poor morphine addict is going to have a difficult time working in a bank ? Barthelmess performs exceptionally well ; and , the filmmakers should be commended for dealing with the story of a war veteran's overcoming of addiction . Director William A . Wellman also excels in " Heroes for Sale " . Loretta Young is lovely as Barthelmess ' leading lady ; but , Aline MacMahon is much more interesting as another woman who secretly desires Barthelmess . Ms . MacMahon might have garnered " Supporting Actress " awards for her characterization , if they had been given in 1933 . Watch McMahon watch Barthelmess ; and , don't miss Barthelmess ' contrasting first look at Ms . Young . The film deals with political notions which are a little confusing , especially with the communist and / or capitalist character played by Robert Barrat ( Max ) . " Heroes for Sale " begins as World War I ends , and concludes in the " present " era , as FDR becomes President . Barthelmess ' character is optimistic about America , stating , " In a few years it will go on bigger and stronger than ever . " Heroes for Sale ( 1933 ) William A . Wellman - Richard Barthelmess , Aline MacMahon , Loretta Young
452618	15896852	268978	8.0	You Do the Math	By the time Russell Crowe ( as John Nash ) married Jennifer Connelly ( as Alicia ) , I had serious concerns about " A Beautiful Mind " . My first question revolved around Mr . Crowe's Princeton roommate , Paul Bettany ( as Charles ) . I could not understand why Mr . Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd . Crowe was there , with a group of other students , but no mixing with Bettany . Why ? Obviously , Bettany loved to imbibe ; so , he should have been the life of the party , I thought . With that question nagging me , I continued to have questions . Like was up with the two men at the later party ? I wondered ? Then , the final straw - Crowe uses his secret " code " to open a security gate ; and , the gate swings open without closing behind him . This was not a very secure gate . Anyone wanting to gain admittance would only have to wait for Crowe to open it up , and walk in after him ( if not climb in ahead of him ) . And , why wasn't Bettany at the Crowe's wedding ? Just when I was wondering how to get in touch with director Ron Howard , the truth dawned on me . I was expecting a more traditional film . A couple of surreal moments should have tipped me off ; for example , Crowe's barroom deduction concerning the students ' chances of " picking up " a blonde women . Still , I didn't fully appreciate what was going on . Was the rollicking car chase with Ed Harris ( as Parcher ) supposed to be an illusion ? Then , I wondered about the characters " Charles " and " Marcee " . I understood " Parcher " as a manifestation of " cold war " paranoia . But , I do not understand what , precisely , " Charles " and " Marcee " reveal about the title character , other than a propensity for creating illusions . The three imaginary characters are the most important in Nash's life - maybe if I knew what they were around for , they'd go away . Eventually , the film confirms suspicions . I can almost see clearly now . A Beautiful Mind ( 2001 ) Ron Howard - Russell Crowe , Jennifer Connelly , Paul Bettany
453008	15896852	371257	8.0	For There is Nothing Either Good or Bad , but Thinking Makes it So	Promising art student Ryan Gosling ( as Henry Letham ) becomes suicidal , after a fatal car accident , on what looks like New York's Brooklyn Bridge . Mr . Gosling's preoccupation with death gets the attention of high-water pants psychiatrist Ewan McGregor ( as Sam Foster ) . Alas , Gosling seems to slip farther and father away from reality , dragging Mr . McGregor's psyche along with him - or , it may be the other way around . Meanwhile , McGregor's beautiful blonde girlfriend Naomi Watts ( as Lila Culpepper ) has had suicidal tendencies of her own ? Guess Who sings " These Eyes - watched you bring my world to an end . This Heart - could not accept , and pretend . " Psyched-out Janeane Garofalo ( Dr . Beth Levy ) , blinded Bob Hoskins ( Dr . Leon Patterson ) , and bleeding Kate Burton ( Mrs . Letham ) lend able , entertaining support . Marc Forster's " Stay " is a superbly well-crafted , award-worthy art film ; so , it's easy to watch over . It was during a second viewing that I amend my initial dissatisfaction with the conclusion . There must be an infinite number of ways to react to the " event " in question ; and , I suppose Gosling's could happen . And , the knowledge about what really happened allows time for more thought regarding the previously ignored , subtle " changes " Gosling's redeemed character brings to those played by McGregor and Ms . Watts . I feel no longer cheated . Stay ( 2005 ) Marc Forster - Ewan McGregor , Ryan Gosling , Naomi Watts
452877	15896852	14440	8.0	Beautiful Spectacle from Ingram with Novarro	Ramon Novarro stars as André-Louis Moreau . Lewis Stone is Moreau's enemy , the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr . And , Alice Terry is the woman they both love , Aline de Kercadiou . The story is set during the time of the French Revolution . The film begins with Mr . Stone as the Marquis de la Tour killing Mr . Novarro ( Moreau's ) best friend , which makes them great enemies . Enemies usually like the same woman ; in this case , the coveted Ms . Terry ( as Aline ) creates the additional animosity . This is a well-produced spectacle , from director Rex Ingram ; the film obviously cost a fortune , and the money was well spent , creating a beautiful looking film . Mr . Ingram does a great job of pacing the approximately two hours of film ; it retains much of its pace today , relative to other 1920s epics . Ingram's cinematographer John F . Seitz and star Ramon Novarro are indispensable . Mr . Seitz ' photography is great , from the windmilly opening until the final conflicts . Some of the spectacular scenes are still terrific ; but , some do look like they were staged to fit the movie screen , where everyone gathers for " Action ! " Mr . Novarro's lead performance is excellent ; though , it might have been wise to let him use more of the ahead-of-their-time skills that are clearly evident . But , what's left is fine - best are the " looks " from the performers , which are not overacted ( mostly ) . Lewis , Terry , and most everyone performs well . Novarro must join an acting troupe , by the way , while on-the-run - he becomes " Monsieur X " and play acts clown " Scaramouche " , giving the film its title . Watch for the relationship between Novarro and a woman from the troupe , and the reason he finally rejects her ( it parallels the major love triangle ) . Also , watch for two of the characters to startlingly look exactly like / alike the " shocking " second revelation at the end of the film . Scaramouche ( 1923 ) Rex Ingram - Ramon Novarro , Lewis Stone , Alice Terry
452632	15896852	8687	8.0	Jack Pickford Takes a Bite Out of the Apple	Jack Pickford ( as Tom Sawyer ) is not the model boy of his village ; in fact , he beats up the model boy ( Carl Goetz ) . Mr . Pickford is impressed with the " juvenile pariah " of the village , Robert Gordon ( as Huckleberry Finn ) - - although Pickford is " under strict orders not to play " with Mr . Gordon , the boys are attracted to each other ; and , Gordon brings Pickford a large watermelon to eat . Sore from tussling with the model boy , and sporting a " sore toe " , Pickford is , nevertheless , ordered to whitewash the Sawyer fence . Along comes Antrim Short ( as Joe Harper ) , eating an apple , and pretending to be a Mississippi river steamboat ; Pickford tricks Short into giving up his apple , and whitewashing the fence . Pickford is munching on a different apple when he notices " new girl in town " Clara Horton ( as Becky Thatcher ) ? Director William Desmond Taylor and writer Julia Crawford Ivers ' adaptation is first rate ; the production team would finish the lads ' adventures with " Huck and Tom " ( 1918 ) and " Huckleberry Finn " ( 1920 ) . This beginning is a surprisingly good , and relatively faithful , version of the Mark Twain classic . The focus is on Pickford's " Tom " , and his friendships with Gordon's " Huck " and Short's " Joe " . The three boys take off together , going down the Mississippi river ; while , back home , the villagers think they are dead . Jack Pickford proves himself to be as good a performer as his more famous sister ( Mary Pickford ) ; he is more than capable in the " Tom Sawyer " role - - skipping , pouting , flirting , jumping fences , and getting sick on fresh catfish ; he brings the character to life . He and the other " children " appear too old for their roles in many instances ; so , for example , Pickford stealing a kiss from Horton loses its innocence , and looks more like an attack . Yet , most of the time , the performers make themselves believable . Though most faithful , this is definitely an interpretation of Twain's characters . There is some symbolism in this film that I don't recall from the novel ( which I will have to re-read ) ; director Taylor uses food ( like the Apple ) from the novel ; but , possibly , in a different way . Pickford and Gordon create a particularly interesting dynamic : drawing lines with their feet , rubbing shoulders , and drawing in their knees . I found the recurring " sore toe " of Tom's fascinating ; and , note that when the boys " escape " , he is relieved from this malady . This is another nuance to track in a re-reading of " Tom Sawyer " .
452836	15896852	393109	8.0	Rian Johnson Makes an Impression with Joseph Gordon-Levitt	In sunny Southern California , love-spurned loner Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( as Brendan Frye ) discovers his former girlfriend's dead body in a watery tunnel . In flashback , Mr . Gordon-Levitt recalls a strung-out Emilie de Ravin ( as Emily Kostich ) reaching out for help , explaining , " I screwed up real bad . " Unfortunately , the soon-to-be-dead blonde speaks in riddles . So , Gordon-Levitt is left with word clues - like " Brick " , " Tug " , " Frisco " , and " Pin " . Cross-legged genius Matt O'Leary ( as Brain ) provides assistance ; fortunately , he remembers everyone's locker number . Realizing the authorities are clueless , Gordon-Levitt decides to carry on his own investigation , beginning with doped-up rival Noah Segan ( as Dode ) . Gordon-Levitt infiltrates the drug ring managed by creepy Tolkien reader Lukas Haas ( as The Pin ) , after mixing with femme fatale Nora Zehetner ( as Laura ) and bodyguard Noah Fleiss ( as Tug ) . Alas , the closer Gordon-Levitt gets to solving the mystery of his ex's death , the more he gets smacked down . " Brick " shimmers with potential . Most obviously , debuting director / writer / editor Rian Johnson makes a great impression ; there is always something interesting happening on Mr . Johnson's screen . Steve Yedlin's crisp photography , and Nathan Johnson's peaking music , are great mood enhancers . Lead actor Gordon-Levitt continues to work wonders with interesting , offbeat roles ; and , importantly , shows he can " carry " a film , with his singular characterization . The story updates 1940s " film noir " quite effectively . The high school setting may have been a mistake ; other than the high-school grounded Mr . O'Leary , the " Brick " cast seem more like post-high school deadbeats . Gordon-Levitt visits his Assistant Vice Principal ( Richard Roundtree ) , but , nobody ever goes to class ; and , there are no scenes in the cafeteria or gym , either . The settings used , instead , are a real treat . Paintings , posters , birds , vehicles , and water add stillness and movement to backgrounds ; but , the movie is never gimmickry or busy . Perhaps the best inside joke ( and a great visual to boot ) was dressing up Mr . Haas as Jonathan Frid from " Dark Shadows " , with his Inverness-styled cape , and cane ; in silhouette , and behind a screen door , Haas even looks like " Barnabas Collins " . As a former " Dark Shadows " star , Gordon-Levitt would have been familiar with the figure ; he played " David Collins " and " Daniel Collins " during the series ' 1991 incarnation . " Brick " is a film to watch with focus and concentration ; if you can't bring those , wait for the right frame of mind .

452912	15896852	6780	8.0	Raising Hell with William S . Hart	As the film begins , William S . Hart ( as " Blaze " Tracy ) is off-screen , in the appropriately named town of " Hell's Hinges " . Mr . Hart is a " man-killer whose philosophy of life is summer up in the creed ' Shoot first and do your disputin ' afterward ' ! " He believes neither law nor religion will ever come to the wretched town he loves . He is wrong . Jack Standing ( as Rev . Robert Henley ) is on his way to town ; he is , as you'll witness , a recently ordained minister with an eye for something other than ladies ' souls . Mr . Standing will also reveal a fondness for drink . Accompanying the bad reverend is his good sister Clara Williams ( as Faith Henley ) . Ms . Williams combines " the strength of character her brother so woefully lacks " and leads Hart to God ( the Jesus Christ version ) . But , is Hart a faithful servant of God , or just another Hell-raising western rogue ? This is an excellent , albeit absurd , film . Steely-eyed Hart is well heeled ; and , the fiery ending is tremendous . Standing's debauched preacher is unexpectedly entertaining . Williams was a noted actress ; but , she doesn't play innocent and alluring ; mainly , she looks admiringly at Hart ( and her brother ) . You may wonder what Hart sees in her , when they first meet ; although , Hart plays the scene well . It's difficult to understand the Williams / Hart attraction , which worked in other films . Thankfully , Louise Glaum ( as Dolly ) is around to play guiltily alluring ; presumably , Hart has had his fill of such women by the time Williams arrives .

452937	15896852	183649	8.0	Smooth Operator	Captivating director Joel Schumacher imprisons cocky publicist Colin Farrell ( as Stu Shepard ) in a Manhattan " Phone Booth " for almost the entire length of this eighty minute movie - and , the result approaches amazing . Mr . Schumacher's cinematic sense , and willingness to experiment , is worth of comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock . Most obviously , this film is " Rear Window " in reverse . Note how successfully both directors keep you , and their protagonists , is their opposite settings . Of course , Mr . Hitchcock ( for a small sample of his " phone booth " usage , see " The Birds " ) would have done several things differently in a feature-length " Phone Booth " . For example , the " menacing " toy near the beginning of the film would certainly have been owned by an annoying kid . And , the film's moral compass ends up strangely askew . Still , Schumacher , cast , and crew keep you on the line . Phone Booth ( / 02 ) Joel Schumacher - Colin Farrell , Kiefer Sutherland , Forest Whitaker

John's Orphanage fire , and takes to the streets . Ten-year-old Coogan meets Jewish junk dealer Max Davidson ( as Max Ginsberg ) ; and , after Coogan returns Mr . Davidson's dropped wallet , he moves in with the rheumatic old man . The two become business partners " Ginsberg and Kelly " , after Coogan proves his " Rag Man " mettle by filling Davidson's junk truck with four dollars worth of merchandise . Along the way , Coogan helps right and old wrong ; he tracks down thieving Robert Edeson ( as Mr . Bernard aka Mr . Bishop ) , who robbed Davidson of a patent fortune . " The Rag Man " is a top-of-the-line Metro-Goldwyn-Coogan production , smoothly directed by Edward F . Cline ; it is highlighted by the Frank Good / Robert Martin photography , which features some great New York City sets and locations . Coogan and Davidson aren't very original , basically re-treading their " Kid " and " Izzy " characterizations ; but , the Irish / Jewish teaming adds some freshness ( as does Linda Martinez ' new soundtrack ) . In the sequel " Old Clothes " , Coogan and Davidson wisely take in young Joan Crawford ( as Mary Riley ) as a boarder . The Rag Man ( 1925 ) Edward F .

453098	15896852	36342	8.0	No Doubt	Sinister Joseph Cotten ( as Charles " Uncle Charlie " Oakley ) eludes some men in Philadelphia , then heads for Santa Rosa , California , where he plans an extended visit with adoring young niece Teresa Wright ( as Charlotte " Charlie " Newton ) and her family . Ms . Wright feels a " special " connection with Mr . Cotten , and the two share the nickname " Charlie " . While Cotton tries to lay low , people want to know , " Where is The Merry Widow Murderer ? " Could it be the Wright's beloved " Uncle Charlie " ? Great starring performances by Cotton and Wright , and superb direction from Alfred Hitchcock , are this film's main attractions . The supporting characters are all , at least , entertaining ; they include , notably , Hume Cronyn ( as Herbie Hawkins ) in his first feature . Mr . Cronyn , with his U . S . flag-pinned lapel , is an obvious supplier of red herrings . Macdonald Carey ( as Jack Graham ) provides Wright with some non-incestuous romantic possibilities . The story's promising psychological depth is somewhat marred by a plot which leaves too many important questions unanswered . The best piece of business that goes nowhere is matriarch Patricia Collinge ( as Emma Newton ) ' s brief reconsideration of her brother's character , after her daughter suffers two near-death " accidents " .

453034	15896852	181689	8.0	Tomorrow Never Knows	In the year 2054 , Washington D . C . is murder free zone . This is because a futuristic " Precrime " program has obtained three precognitive humans ( called " pre-cogs " ) who have a talent for predicting murder . The three individuals perpetually dream about future crimes , in a secured area nicknamed " The Temple " ; there , they float in a tank of water . The US government falsely claims the three live a luxurious lifestyle - working out in a weight room , for example - but , the pre-cogs are , essentially , imprisoned for the good of society . According to Precrime , the pre-cogs " see the future " and are " never wrong " . The Washington program has prevented all murders for the past six years , and is about to be implemented nationally . As the film opens , top Precrime gun Tom Cruise ( as John Anderton ) goes through some visual evidence downloaded from the pre-cogs ' minds , and arrests an individual for the " future murder " of his wife and lover . Mr . Cruise has a back-story . Years earlier , Cruise's young son was abducted , indirectly destroying his marriage . Cruise also takes illegal drugs , which does not effect his work or appearance adversely . Distinguished Director of Precrime Max von Sydow ( as Lamar Burgess ) is wary of arriving agent Colin Farrell ( as Danny Witwer ) . He should be , Mr . Farrell is there to investigate the Precrime program . Farrell fears the system may be flawed . Due to a startling encounter with pre-cog Samantha Morton ( as Agatha ) , Cruise also becomes suspicious . Then , the pre-cogs identify an unexpected murderer , right in the heart of Precrime ! Orwellian " thought police " ( aka thinkpol ) are never a good utopian sign . There are plenty of plot holes and / or contrivances in " Minority Report " . For example , how is it that these geniuses can't anticipate or detect an eye transplant ? And , a certain pregnant woman made me laugh out LOUD . Still , this is excellent , exciting entertainment from Mr . Spielberg and company . Turn off your mind , relax , and float with Steven .

Seeking employment and pals , Mr . Barthelmess decides to join the Navy . Meanwhile , in coastal Wautucket , dressmaker Dorothy Mackaill ( as Connie Martin ) longs for male companionship . " Shore Leave " brings sailor Barthelmess to Ms . Mackaill's attention ; and , she invites him over for a home-cooked meal . Barthelmess steals a brief kiss , and sets sail - but , he promises to return for more . Mackaill is smitten with her sailor date , and waits ? for years ? until Barthelmess returns ? A charming picture , but , today , it requires some suspension of disbelief . There are a couple of hints Barthelmess ' character was likely a " randy " sailor , so why did he settle for that lackluster first kiss ? And , the film explains the town of Wautucket was a fledgling seaport , but " spinster " Mackaill is lovely enough to have attracted some local attention . Later , Barthelmess rejects her because she's wealthy ! . . . but ? the actors make it believable . The film was much-admired in its day . Barthelmess ' performance in " Shore Leave " was one of the " Motion Picture Magazine " best of the year 1925 , alongside Lon Chaney , W . C . Fields , John Gilbert , and winner Emil Jannings ( for " The Last Laugh " ) . Mackaill ( a frequent co-star ) is also very good . There is a sweet , natural quality to their acting ( which certainly fits the storyline ) ; witness her falling in love over supper , and his recognition of her , after two years of sailing . John S . Robertson ( director ) and Roy Overbaugh ( cinematographer ) manage the New York locations and set pieces nicely . Debuting Ted McNamara ( as " Battling " Smith ) handles his comic sidekick role well ; he probably would have been a character actor long into the talking picture era , but died of phenomena in 1928 . Barthelmess has named his " Shore Leave " characterization as a personal favorite - still , it was his last collaboration with director Robertson ? who replaced Henry King ? who replaced D . W . Griffith ? Shore Leave ( / 25 ) John S . Robertson - Richard Barthelmess , Dorothy Mackaill , Ted McNamara

The war , and Adolphe Menjou , threaten to come between them . . . This film features some startling , indelible images . The acting is also first rate . Mr . Cooper and Ms . Hayes make their characters ' courtship very believable - with performances transcending what could be acted , or shown on-screen , at the time . Their closing scene is classic . Mr . Menjou leads a strong supporting cast ; interestingly , his interest in Cooper looks highly ambiguous , intentional or not . Arguably , Menjou's character shows more interest in him than her . The story is just a little too soapy ; and , it lacks a certain cohesion . It's unsteady , at times . Yet , director Frank Borzage elicits some dazzling performance and images in " A Farewell to Arms " . Peace . A Farewell to Arms ( 1932 ) Frank Borzage - Helen Hayes , Gary Cooper , Adolphe Menjou

Soon we meet the many women in the boarding house , and become involved in their hopes , friendships and competitions . . . This is a very busy film . We are introduced to many characters and situations , it's sometimes difficult to focus on the story . It's the revolving door of stardom ( one star dies , another is born ) , centering around the relationship between Ms . Hepburn and Ms . Rogers ( mainly ) and the rest ( complimenting the leads and the theme ) . The film's many other performers are distracting ? there are so many stars to watch . Eve Arden comes on with a cat and I don't know what else just happened ! I had to read the IMDb comments , and watch this one twice , to make sure I didn't miss anything .

His latest caper involves some embezzled bank money that apparently is hidden in the bank president's mansion . A reclusive woman and her niece are currently renting the mansion ? Our villain must find a way to frighten off the unsuspecting boarders in order to find the stolen money , as well as try to stay one step ahead of the law , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " Can you keep a secret ? " the film begins , " Don't reveal the identity of ' The Bat ' . Future audiences will fully enjoy this mystery play if left to find out for themselves . " This excellent silent film should be much more highly regarded than it is , currently . Director Roland West , with cinematographers Arthur Edeson and Gregg Toland , creates a fine " Dark Night " setting for " The Batman " ; the film either influenced , or inspired imitations which influenced , DC's comic book hero . One of the film's many imitators was Mr . West's own " The Bat Whispers " ( 1930 ) . Jack Pickford ( as Brooks Bailey ) and West's wife , Jewel Carmen ( as Dale Ogden ) , lead the ensemble cast . This was Ms . Carmen's last feature film ; she was a fairly big star , but worked less as her popularity grew . The even more popular Mr . Pickford ( brother of Mary ) is quite good ; certainly , none of the problems which plagued Pickford in the late 1920s show up in his performance . Comedic maid Louise Fazenda ( as Lizzie Allen ) manages to stand out , despite datedness . And , Emily Fitzroy ( as Cornelia Van Gorder ) knits throughout .

452876	15896852	44837	8.0	Limelight is a Cruel Lover	Charlie Chaplin moves into the 1950s with an unusual drama about an alcoholic old timer ( Chaplin as Calvero ) and suicidal young ballerina ( Claire Bloom as Terry ) . The comedian " Calvero " is drunk as the film opens , and obviously in the twilight of his career . He rescues Ms . Bloom from a suicide attempt and helps her to get back on her feet ( so to speak ) . The film seems almost like nothing , but becomes quite substantial . It's a very thoughtful film - - obviously , Chaplin in his 60s has lost none of his film-making skills : the difference is that you come to Chaplin on His terms . No longer interested ( capable ? ) of producing massive audience " hits " , Chaplin produces an indulgent , sentimental " Limelight " . It's an excellent work , but very hard to digest . Some impressions : Comedy is ballet . Life is ballet . Young needs old . Old needs young . Comics need a drug . Perhaps the film needs a single focus ? I found the sequences where Chaplin is told by the " suits " he's washed-up to be most memorable ; along with the small scene where a comic goes in for Chaplin's job because he's heard the old clown is awful . The stuff with Buster Keaton is very nice , too , and makes you wish the would have done a full film together . I believe Keaton's role makes the film deliberately less autobiographical than many would believe , but you can never be sure ? Chaplin is interesting to watch always ; when he seems to be doing nothing , he's not . Limelight ( 1952 ) Charles Chaplin - Charlie Chaplin , Claire Bloom , Buster Keaton
453001	15896852	18566	8.0	When Barrymore Loves Costello	In an old French cathedral town , during the reign of Louis XV , devoted churchman John Barrymore ( as Chevalier Fabien des Grieux ) is studying to become a Priest . One May morning , virginal Dolores Costello ( as Manon Lescaut ) arrives at the musty convent , like " a flower freshly plucked from the countryside " ; when Mr . Barrymore sees Ms . Costello , the seeds of romance are firmly planted . Meanwhile , Costello's scheming brother Warner Oland ( as André Lescaux ) decides to prostitute sister Costello . Barrymore overhears Mr . Oland's plotting , and whisks Costello off to Paris . Eventually , Costello feels the lure of jewels and pretty clothes ; and , Barrymore is torn between lust and the Lord . Sheer nonsense , but extremely well-produced - - firstly , Alan Crosland's " When a Man Loves " is another great opportunity to see star lovers Barrymore and Costello ( who would soon marry off-screen ) . Oland and the man he sells Costello to , Sam de Grasse ( as Monsieur Guillot de Morfontaine ) , head up a delightful supporting cast . Look out for a hilariously over-painted Bertram Grassby ( as Le Duc de Richelieu ) , Tom Santschi sneeringly captaining the convict boat , and pretty prisoner Myrna Loy . The convict ship trip ending , with its swelling Vitaphone soundtrack , and Barrymore going ballistic . . . all fantastic . Barrymore's performance becomes amazing . Don't desert the ship - - keep watching until the exciting ending payoff .
453181	15896852	18618	8.0	All the Brothers Were Valiant	Ramon Novarro ( as Joel ) is the youngest of the seafaring Shore family . While older brother Ernest Torrence ( as Mark ) is off on a long voyage , Mr . Novarro falls for fetching Joan Crawford ( as Pricilla ) . Upon returning , Mr . Torrence is revealed to have also fallen for the bewitching Ms . Crawford - and , eventually , the brothers become rivals . Crawford prefers Novarro , but her father " betrothes " her to Torrence . Before their wedded bliss begins , however , the Shore brothers must make a trip to Singapore ; it's Novarro's first voyage with older brothers , after proving himself in a barroom brawl . While sailing " Across to Singapore " , a fierce storm blasts the Shore brothers ' " Nathan Ross " ship - with tragic results ? Actually , this is a version of " All the Brothers Were Valiant " . Perhaps the title was changed because one brother clearly dominates ( Novarro ) , and only one other figures prominently ( Torrence ) . Although there are four Shore brothers , you won't see much of the others , valiant or otherwise . It's odd MGM re-made this story in 1928 ; it was seen relatively recently , in 1923 , with Malcolm McGregor , Lon Chaney , and Billie Dove as Joel , Mark , and Pricilla . AND , there was no sound version until 1953 , with Robert Taylor , Stewart Granger , and Ann Blyth in the principal roles . Novarro performs very well , especially enjoy his scene with Crawford , when she boards the ship to bid farewell , before his maiden voyage . It's also one of Crawford's best scenes , and the lower " Nathan Ross " set is beautifully detailed . Anna May Wong also performs very well ; though uncredited , she is the best supporting player . Note Ms . May Wong's excellent introduction ( during the first trip to Singapore ) - she relates her dissatisfaction with her man , and her desire for Mark , with a few simple gestures . May Wong is superb , and should have been included in the film's credits . James Mason ( not the later actor ) is fine as the villain . There are some problems with the story . The whole " betrothed " issue is confusing to me , and may be to others . I also don't understand why an experienced sailor like Mark Shore immediately goes below and gets drunk ; perhaps , he saw little brother with Crawford earlier on ? I wondered how Mark Shore could order a certain character killed , and , seconds later reverse said order . Though a fine actor , I had some trouble accepting Torrence in this role - I expected him to be the villain , due to his other indelible portrayals . A big MGM production , with a lot of excitement , and a fine cast . The voyages of the " Nathan Ross " are particularly exciting ? great storm , and great ending . This is a film that was " saved " in the nick of time , however , and some of the film is sadly deteriorated ; happily , it is still enjoyable .

When the normal-sized Ms . Baclanova finds out little man Mr . Earles is rich , she decides to lure him into marriage . At her wedding feast , Cleopatra's ulterior motives become clear to the " Freaks " ; then , they enact their terrifying revenge ? The last great Tod Browning film ; " Freaks " has to be seen to be believed . The cast is sometimes so riveting , they distract from the story .

453698	15896852	38109	8.0	Alfred Hitchcock casts a Minor Spell with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck	Stolid psychoanalyst Ingrid Bergman ( as Constance Peterson ) falls head over heels in love at first sight with handsome Gregory Peck ( as Anthony Edwardes ) . Young Mr . Peck is the newly arriving young director at the Vermont insane asylum , where Ms . Bergman dispenses lay analysis . Soon , it becomes obvious that Peck is harboring a very dark secret - he is an amnesiac ( John Ballantine ) suspected of murdering the asylum's real director , and taking his place . Love-struck Bergman assumes the identity of Peck's wife , and endeavors to prove he is not guilty . Soon , Peck's fragile psyche will have you questioning not only Peck's innocence , but also Bergman's sanity ? Alfred Hitchcock's obvious directorial touches make " Spellbound " a good watch . Surrealistic artist Salvador Dali contributes a psychotic dream sequence , and composer Miklós Rózsa's eerie theremin-enhanced soundtrack adds some suspense . Bergman and Peck look , and act , splendid for the master , basking in beautiful black-and-white photography from George Barnes . Michael Chekhov ( as Alex Brulov ) and Leo G . Carroll ( as Murchison ) are good supporting doctors . Pretty Rhonda Fleming ( as Mary Carmichael ) is a nymphomaniac who , sadly , isn't left alone with Peck . The film's " Achilles ' heel " is its ludicrous psychobabble . Spellbound ( 1945 ) Alfred Hitchcock - Ingrid Bergman Gregory Peck , Michael Chekhov
453164	15896852	29546	8.0	The Way You Wear Your Hat	In order to fend off an admiring ballerina , phony Russian ballet star Fred Astaire ( as Peter " Petrov " Peters ) falsely claims he's married to a beautiful American musical star he admires , Ginger Rogers ( as Linda Keene ) . To complicate matters , and get closer to lovely Ms . Rogers , Mr . Astaire joins her on a ship leaving France for New York . On board , Rogers treats Astaire with disdain , while gossiping newspapers report their " secret wedding " and " blessed event " . Can Astaire's elegant charm , and sweet singing , win Rogers ' heart ? for real ? " Shall We Dance " dutifully duplicated the success of previous Astaire / Rogers box office hits . Astaire issued his standard three 78 RPM Brunswick singles , which proceeded to saturate radio waves , and effortlessly made " Hit Parades " during the spring of 1937 - peaking in the following positions : " They Can't Take That Away from Me " ( # 1 ) / " ( I've Got ) Beginner's Luck " ( # 13 ) , " Shall We Dance ? " ( # 3 ) / " Let's Call the Whole Thing Off " ( # 5 ) , and Astaire's version of Rogers ' film song " They All Laughed " ( # 6 ) / " Slap That Bass " . The wonderful George & Ira Gershwin written songs , and the workmanship RKO / Astaire / Rogers delivery , is what really keeps the film's flimsy , formulaic story above board .

452714	15896852	86856	8.0	No Matter Where You Go , There You Are	Buckaroo Banzai's latest adventure ( and , his first revealed in any media ) begins with Peter Weller as the Samurai , " renaissance man , neurosurgeon , physicist , race car driver , rock star , AND comic book hero " test driving his Jet Car through a mountain . Due to the vehicle's " oscillation overthruster " , Mr . Weller emerges unscathed - he and his Jet Car pass through solid matter . Unfortunately , the car picks up a glob of inter-dimensional matter . Coincidentally ( actually , not coincidentally ) , super-weird physicist John Lithgow ( as Emilio Lizardo ) ends his five decade residency at the " New Brunswick Home for the Criminally Insane " . . . As it turns out , Mr . Lithgow is an alien ( they are all named " John " ) from " Planet 10 " . On Halloween 1938 , Lithgow and some " Red Lectroids " arrived on Earth . Their mission failed , and many were thrown into " The 8th Dimension " . This event was , by the way , was misinterpreted as an invasion from Mars , by Orson Welles , during his infamous October 30 , 1938 radio broadcast version of H . G . Wells ' " War of the Worlds " . By the late 1960s , other media hinted at the continued Lectroid presence . Examples include ABC-TV's " The Invaders " and novelist Thomas Pynchon's " The Crying of Lot 49 " . Presently , defeating the Red Lectroid invaders is up to multi-talented " Buckaroo Banzai " ( Weller ) and his hard-rocking team of " Hong Kong Cavaliers " : Lewis Smith ( as Perfect Tommy ) , Jeff Goldblum ( as New Jersey ) , Clancy Brown ( as Rawhide ) , Pepe Serna ( as Reno Nevada ) , and Billy Vera ( as Pinky Carruthers ) . Suicidal Ellen Barkin ( as Penny Priddy ) provides Banzai romantic interest . " The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai ( Across the 8th Dimension ) " is intelligent fun , from writer Earl Mac Rauch and director W . D . Richter . Lithgow is a perfect Lectroid , " Laugh while you can , monkey boy ! " Really , he and the likes of Vincent Schiavelli ( as John O'Connor ) couldn't be anyone but aliens , could they ? In hindsight , perhaps the " Black Letroid " and " Penny Priddy " parts might have been better re-worked . Still , it's a classic . And , it still leaves you looking forward to " Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League " , with Weller and the Cavaliers . The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai ( 1984 ) W . D .

453370	15896852	55489	8.0	The Pleasure of His Company	Tennessee Williams ' tale of sexual repression in a small Mississippi town makes it to the big screen , with enough , but not all , of its integrity intact ; most notably , it glistens when it should sweat . Geraldine Page ( as Alma Winemiller ) is excellent as the minister's daughter who guiltily longs for rakish playboy Laurence Harvey ( as John Buchanan Jr . ) . Ms . Page's characterization is one that unravels ; its full impact realized is in a devastating last act . Mr . Harvey does well , successfully conveying the near-equal importance of his character . Page gives Harvey spiritual love , and he wants her physically ; their reversal of desire is very convincingly , and thoughtfully , portrayed . Excellent supporting performances are highlighted by crazed Una Merkel ( as Mother Winemiller ) and lonely Earl Holliman ( as Archie Kramer ) . If the film seems a little too staged , remember , it is Tennessee Williams ; a staged atmosphere is pardonable when your fluttering heroine speaks lines like , " The wind is penetrating this afternoon . " ( A decade earlier , Page played the role on stage . ) Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is lovely . Music , performance , and dialogue give " Summer and Smoke " an appropriately sexually-charged atmosphere . Toss thoughts of blasphemy to the wind , and turn OFF the color ( if you can ) , to watch " Summer and Smoke " in mood-altering grayish tones .

452809	15896852	10040	8.0	Mary Pickford Makes it Work	Mary Pickford ( as Jerusha " Judy " Abbott ) is found , as a baby , in a garbage dump . Orphaned , she is brought to the " John Grier Home " , where young boys and girls are treated more like convicts than children . By the time she is 12 , little Mary is leading the orphans in a strike against eating prunes . Some years later , Ms . Pickford is the beneficiary of a lucky , life-changing event : one of the orphanage's new trustees wants to sponsor an orphan's higher education ; and Pickford is chosen . At college , Pickford is a fetching young woman , which sends Cupid's arrows flying . Love-struck Princeton man Marshall Neilan ( as Jimmie Mc Bride ) and " older man " ( as Jarvis Pendleton ) vie for Pickford's hand in marriage . Pickford becomes a writer ; her first effort fails , but she instinctively follows the advice " write what you know " in creating a successful tome about orphans . Finally , Pickford must choose her man , and payback her " mysterious benefactor " . Some of " Daddy-Long-Legs " doesn't ring true ; vignettes are cute , in isolation , but add little to the overall film ; it's obvious , for example , that the children experience some childhood fun , which is said to be completely absent . And , the cruelty of the " John Grier Home " is hardly comparable to a prison ! You may also wonder why a fully clothed boy is considered " naked " , how a baby might have digested a mouth organ , how that girl got in and out of the well , and other stuff . The film is not at all unpredictable . However , Mary Pickford is outstanding . She very believably plays " Judy " - - growing from a precocious 12-year-old girl to young career woman . As the film progresses , Pickford seems to add layers upon her character . For example , in some later scene , beginning at a society party where Pickford admires some ancestral portraits ; watch , as the party progresses , both Pickford's past , and future , register on her face . Pickford constructs her character extremely well . Director Marshall Neilan ( who also appears , as Jimmie Mc Bride ) was an important Pickford collaborator ; and the supporting cast is delightful . Wesley Barry is wonderful as Pickford's early orphan pal ; he manages to steal scenes from Mary Pickford - - 11-year-old Barry play " drunk " better than Pickford ! Carrie Clark Ward is delightful as love-weary " Mrs . Semple " , and Fay Lemport ( as Angelina Wyckoff ) shows how pampered , selfish little girls grow up . " Daddy-Long-Legs " was filmed again and again , but this is the definitive version , thanks , mainly , to Mary Pickford .
453433	15896852	33870	8.0	Full of Sound and Fury	Humphrey Bogart plays grimacing detective Sam Spade in John Huston's " The Maltese Falcon " - a classic film ; and , it deserves that status , in many respects . The performances are and " noir look " of the film help tremendously . Peter Lorre's was the best characterization - and , he's great with " The Fat Man " Sydney Greenstreet . Mr . Bogart was memorable , as was Mary Astor , but , I didn't see any special magic in their relationship ( perhaps none was intended ) . It was nice to see Bogart paired with a woman closer to his own age . The weakest element in " The Maltese Falcon " is a story that never really takes a stranglehold on your mind ; which is made worse by the fact that it always seems like it is about to - like there is some mysterious all-connecting story element to be revealed ( perhaps none was intended ) .

453715	15896852	16822	8.0	Colleen Moore's Cinderella Story	Because the plot of this very well-produced silent film is so easily recognizable as " Cinderella " , it can be one of your most enjoyable introductions to both the silent film genre , and to one of its most popular actresses , Colleen Moore . The film was an adaptation of the then popular new comic strip " Ella Cinders " , with changes to the heroine's situation that were perfectly suited to a silent film starring Ms . Moore . The film easily transcends its source , and succeeds as prime example of the often repeated story about a young woman achieving her dream to become a Hollywood movie star - itself , a " Cinderella " story . Who knew comic strips could be perfect silent film fodder ? The Hollywood " movie set " scenes aren't as clever as in other films of this type , despite the appearance of Harry Langdon and others , in cameos . Director Alfred E . Green , Lloyd Hughes ( as George Waite ) , and Vera Lewis ( as Ma Cinders ) make good contributions . Interestingly , Moore is best on screen , alone , with a lion or fire ; and , when attempting to , " Master the art of expressing every emotion with the eyes , " imitate Jackie Coogan , and pose at a " photo session " for the movie star contest she eventually wins . " Ella Cinders " was a huge success , and helped propel Colleen Moore to the # 1 position on Quigley Publications ' " Box Office Stars " list for 1926 . Ella Cinders ( / 26 ) Alfred E .

452413	15896852	38235	8.0	Close to the Dirt	In Italy , a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants . " A Walk in the Sun " is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone , utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera . It's unusually poetic , for the time , courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen . And , certainly , the film should grow in stature , over the years , when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era . Upon release , the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its " realism " . Presently , this strength is weighted . Still , the film's substance endures . Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers . Two stand out , and give the film greater emotional depth . Though it begins , necessarily , as a team effort , reluctant Dana Andrews ( as Bill Tyne ) emerges as the " hero " ; and , John Ireland ( as Windy Craven ) stands out among the other soldiers . Mr . Andrews is the man who takes command , after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure . Andrews is terrific ; especially , note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor . Mr . Ireland's performance , as a poetic minister's son , is award-worthy . Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you : " the farmer " , " the prophet " ? accompanied by an almost too sentimental , heart-tugging soundtrack . But , however you try to resist , it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell , as he explains " G . I . Dirt " , and writes letters home " in his head " . While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission , it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan . The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting , talking , teamwork , and action during war .
453572	15896852	404390	8.0	Down the Rabbit Hole with Wayne Kramer	" Struggling mob hand Joey Gazelle ( Paul Walker ) finds his life turned inside-out when a ' hot ' weapon he's in charge of concealing goes missing . With two mafia families and a team of crooked cops watching his every move , Joey sets out on a chilling , bloody pursuit , maneuvering his way through a horrific web of creeps and criminals , praying he can retrieve the gun and make it home to his family - alive , " according to the Warner Home Video synopsis . Well , Mr . Walker turns out to not quite fit that description ; and , you won't see much time spent on " praying " ( perhaps , Warner Brothers meant " preying " ? ) - anyway , Wayne Kramer's " Running Scared " is a shocking , viscerally violent , and potentially offensive bloodbath . Two of the film's featured players are adolescents , Cameron Bright ( as Oleg Yugorsky ) and Alex Neuberger ( as Nicky Gazelle ) . The youths do well in their roles , but I'm not sure they should see the movie - at least , not without an intense debriefing conversation . Kramer , with photographer James Whitaker , and their crew make " Running Scared " a relentlessly violent , but beautifully filmed , " Grimm " fairy tale . The " pedophile " sequence , with Bruce Altman ( as Dez ) and Elizabeth Mitchell ( as Edele ) , is astonishingly well shot . Here , with a bright set and creepy shadows , Kramer's suggestion of horror is chilling . This section of the film is most successful , with relatively little violence , and no sex . For fans of less subtle bloodletting , Kramer ends with a some brutally violent hockey rink horror . In hindsight , there are some improvable plot points ? Vera Farmiga ( as Teresa ) and Ivana Milicevic ( as Mila ) make their presence felt , in a largely male film . And , Karel Roden ( as Anzor Yugorsky ) is a John Wayne fan from Hell . The end credit characterizations , which hammer home the fairly tale quality hinted at throughout , are well-drawn , and seem a little wasted in proximity . While exceedingly violent , " Running Scared " is a striking , stylish film . Running Scared ( 2006 ) Wayne Kramer - Paul Walker , Cameron Bright , Vera Farmiga
453105	15896852	44687	8.0	Bobby Driscoll Comes of Age	Bobby Driscoll ( as Robert " Bibi " Bonnard ) is a teenager " coming of age " in 1920s Ottawa . Mr . Driscoll's uncle , traveling salesman Louis Jourdan ( as Desmond Bonnard ) , is away when the film begins ; he enjoys a " playboy " lifestyle , but returns soon , for a visit . Driscoll's father , Charles Boyer ( as Jacques Bonnard ) appears to have grown out of an extended career of his own , as a " ladies ' man " ; and his father , randy Marcel Dalio ( as Grandpa Bonnard ) , recognizes " la puberty " is beginning for Driscoll ? Everyone in the cast is outstanding ; but , " The Happy Time " is , more than anything , Driscoll's film . He more than holds his own , among the distinguished cast . Watching Driscoll perform in this film makes his sudden slide from favor all the more puzzling - - he may not have grown up according to the Disney studio's specifications , but few do . As evidenced here , Driscoll should have had a long working career as , if anything , a comedian ; " ? only one is from the burlesque , the other was obtained privately , " he says , arriving at the dinner table wearing garters . Director Richard Fleischer does Earl Felton's smartly written play justice . The film is full of nice " symbolic " touches - - the canary , the girl's braces , and the medals appearing inside more than one of the characters ' jackets . While beautifully done , the film's ill-mannered presentation of sex , love , and gender roles seems very queer ; probably , the film's themes held significantly more charm in the 1950s . Also worth watching for Kurt Kasznar ( repeating his stage role as a possibly alcoholic neighboring uncle ) , Marsha Hunt ( whom Driscoll seems to take after , in looks ) , Linda Christian ( recalling of Eva Gabor ) , Jimmy Bishop ( a young Chuck Connors ) , and Marlene Cameron ( entering her own " happy time " ) .
453053	15896852	68286	9.0	First You Must Learn How to Kill	I put the tape in , made a quick trip to the refrigerator , and returned to find six guys acting like they were animals , being massacred by hunters . Curses ! I thought the tape hadn't been re-wound - - and , I was watching the ending . BUT , it was only a nightmare . This IS how the film begins . . . Barry Robins ( as " Cotton " ) wakes up , all right , in his " Box Canyon Boys Camp " cabin . Mr . Robins rounds up his troops ; then , they head out to save the buffalo ? and civilization . The opening " flashback " is appropriately disturbing . More importantly , it clearly and directly relates the teenagers at the " Boys Camp " to caged animals . Further flashbacks tell the story of how the six " emotionally disturbed " kids are put out , by failed parents , to be either housed or " corrected " . The camp's motto is : " Send Us A Boy ? We'll Send You A Cowboy " ! The prospective cowboys , corralled by leader Robins , are : stoner Bill Mumy ( as " Teft " ) , comedian Miles Chapin ( as " Shecker " ) , fairy Darel Glaser ( as Goodenow ) , and feuding siblings Bob Kramer ( as " Lolly 1 " ) and Marc Vahanian ( as " Lolly 2 " ) . The entire cast performs well , with Robins and Mr . Mumy more obviously standing out . Watch for a great scene , after the travelers ' " Pest Control " truck , hot-wired by Mumy , runs out of gas . Robins tries to start the truck ; and , his hopeless efforts trigger an important " flashback " . Imaginatively directed , by Stanley Kramer , we see Robins through his mother's vanity mirror , applying make-up for a young date . When Robins threatens to reveal his mother's age , she responds , " I'll kill you . . . " Telling . Another important , well-played , sequence occurs with Mr . Glaser's last " flashback " - - to when he was " cast out " of his cabin . Branded a " sissy " for bed wetting , Glaser is humiliated , and attempts suicide . Robins is the boy's Savior ; he raises " Goodenow " from a drowning pool to the " Bedwetters " cabin , where introductions are made . This part of the film might have been better placed earlier , as it so effectively " introduces " the individual characters , and cinematically ties them together as a team . While this is a " non-linear " film , there are editing / continuity problems ( real and speculative ) ; hopefully , a better cut version of " Bless the Beasts & Children " can be found . The music is outstanding : both the instrumental theme by Barry DeVorzon and Perry Botkin Jr . , and the vocals " Bless the Beasts and the Children " ( by Carpenters ) and the ill-titled " It's a Beautiful Day " by co-star Mumy ( written with Paul Gordon ) .

453534	15896852	36868	9.0	Nothing But the Best	This is a great film from director William Wyler , cast and crew . I agree with so many of the prior comments . The film's appeal - represented early on by amputee Harold Russell - is that this is going to be a realistic depiction of post-war comings home . Mr . Russell , Mr . March , and Mr . Andrews make a great team , and each give great performances . Russell is an amputee , March has an alcohol problem , and Andrews shows some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms . The film shows them adjusting , or not adjusting , to civilian life . Myrna Loy is wonderful to watch ? especially , her eyes . The background / foreground action is nice . I noticed that March and the others do not look like they've missed all that much shaving , despite the script . In fact , March's moustache looks very neatly trimmed , to me . My major criticism is , after starting as a " realistic " drama , the film ends with a glossy " happy ending " . The servicemen's differing problems are all too conveniently . . . gone . The movie becomes less a realistic drama and more a Fantasy Hollywood Movie . It becomes way , way too sentimental . It's , still , incredibly well-presented sentimentality . I think its closeness to the actual war being represented both adds and detracts from the film . I'm sure audiences benefited from this movie greatly during release - but , it was too soon for an honest reflection . Instead of it's goal , I think the film becomes an essential American time capsule . It shows the mood of the country in a way , today , the filmmakers were perhaps not expecting - and , it's sentimentally perfect Hollywood ending is no less valuable than gritty real life dramas .

453475	15896852	110632	9.0	A Red-Blooded American Man and Woman	In 1994 , Oliver Stone held a mirror up to the face of America's preoccupation with mindless violence , and most recoiled in disgust . It was a good sign ! Alas , the obsession remains ; and , with a few twists and turns unforeseen in Mr . Stone's film . Perhaps , it won't end until a " reality show " films an actual " Mickey and Mallory Knox " in action . Until then , " Natural Born Killers " gives the lowest common dominator exactly what they won't admit they desire : " The gory details . " Thankfully , Stone and his skillful crew depict the violence in an artful , poetic , and ( sometimes ) humorous manner . Violent or not , it is an excellent piece of film-making . Stone , with photographer Robert Richardson , uses film types and techniques in an extraordinarily powerful way ; the differing styles are a relevant enhancement of the story , rather than a catalog of gimmicks . Stone brilliantly captures 1990s TV media ( and beyond ) . In particular , Robert Downey Jr . ' s portrayal of an Australian Geraldo Rivera-type interviewer " Wayne Gale " is a dead-on treasure . This type of interviewer peddles the perverse as entertainment ; and , with viewers ratings , turns " folks " like Charles Manson , Bonnie , and Clyde into celebrity stars . A decade later , Chris Hansen's " To Catch a Predator " proved media could sink even lower , by celebrating pedophilia . Woody Harrelson and Juliet Lewis are individually chilling and brave , in the lead roles ; somehow , they aren't as memorable together as other criminal and / or degenerate couples ( " Bonnie and Clyde " , " Sid and Nancy " ) . Perhaps , their relative aloofness is intentional . Mr . Downey Jr . and Tom Sizemore are award-worthy , in their supporting roles ; the former's portrayal is the best example of the film's uncomfortable resonation . Stone's soundtrack choices ( Yo ! Patti Smith ) rock . The " Nature / Nurture " balance / influence on the film's anti-heroes is explained during the appropriately placed " Super Bowl " TV interview .

452744	15896852	43961	9.0	Audie Murphy Carries the Flag after Everything Has Gone Boom	Director John Huston's version of Stephen Crane's U . S . Civil War classic " The Red Badge of Courage " is an unusual , but ultimately engrossing , film . It is infamous for provoking major Hollywood infighting - read Lillian Ross ' " Picture " , a book on the film's troubled history . Huston's original version was severely cut ; unfortunately , the missing footage is believed to have been destroyed . Yet , this film fairly accurately retains the novel's possibly controversial storyline / theme , as a generous amount of soldiers are shown deserting their battalion ( including the star protagonist ) . It's enough to make you wonder what was cut , and why . The youthful Audie Murphy ( as Henry Fleming ) is terrific as the Union soldier confronting feelings of cowardice , before fighting Confederate rebels . A genuine World War II hero , Mr . Murphy carries the film extraordinarily well . The sequence wherein Murphy ends a battle with the American flag held high , as he holds the Confederate flag waving sideways above ground , should be an iconic movie image . It photographically capsulizes the war for many . Murphy's courageous performance was worthy of some " Best Actor " consideration . The narration , despite being genuine Crane , doesn't quite work ; but , the supporting characters , led by loud soldier Bill Mauldin ( as Tom Wilson ) convey the novel's voices nicely . Despite having his film cut by ( possibly ) half , Huston's direction remains excellent . And , Harold Rosson's black-and-white photography is also award-worthy . Salute the cast and crew for surviving " The Red Badge of Courage " so eloquently . The Red Badge of Courage ( 1951 ) John Huston - Audie Murphy , Bill Mauldin , John Dierkes , Royal Dano
453607	15896852	41746	9.0	The Racism in Your Face	Well-mannered nurse Jeanne Crain ( as Patricia " Pinky " Johnson ) returns to her poor " Black " neighborhood , in Mississippi . There , she is welcomed by washerwoman grandmother Ethel Waters ( as Granny ) . The pair are confronted by racism both outside and inside their home . Most importantly , it is revealed that Ms . Crain has been " passing " as " White " . Moreover , Crain has become engaged to Caucasian doctor William Lundigan ( as Thomas Adams ) . While working at home , to support Crain's nursing education , Ms . Waters has grown close to ailing Ethel Barrymore ( as Miss Em ) . At first , Crain does not understand or accept the friendship between Waters , a former slave , and Ms . Barrymore , a former plantation owner . But , for her grandmother , Crain agrees to become Barrymore's nurse . " Pinky " is a nerve-rattling classic . Probably , the most obvious " debate " point was the casting of Crain in the title role . Crain was definitely " pink " enough ( or , white-looking ) ; but , her general " movie star " persona makes the casting decision seem risky . Yet , Crain , under Elia Kazan's direction , triumphs . There are so many ways Crain could have fallen into acting traps - she could have used mannerisms , make-up , and / or other stereotypical devices to " camp " up the " Black " - but , she avoids each trap . Crain performs the role with a great amount of dignity . She was deservedly honored with an " Academy Award " nomination . Barrymore and Waters also perform well ( as you might expect ) . We are never , in the film , given a clear statement of facts regarding the heritage of Crain's " Pinky " . My guess is that she is related , by blood , to both Waters and Barrymore . An attempted rape of Crain's character accounts , arguably , for her pink appearance ; this might have occurred in more than one generation . It's also possible that a loving " mixed race " relationship was part of either Ethel's past . Making the " Black / White " history more clear would have only gotten the film into more trouble . " Pinky " was quickly censored , and headed for the US Supreme Court . One of the Board of Censors ' objections was , " a white man retaining his love for a woman after learning that she is a Negro . " However , Mr . Lundigan's " Thomas " is only willing to retain his love under certain conditions ; and , this leads to a sharp , less " Hollywood " - styled ending . The Supreme Court was correct . Some of the film's best scenes show the way Crain is treated after other characters learn she is not white .

452604	15896852	97714	9.0	Tra-La-La ( and The Killing of Georgie , Part I )	A startling trip into the lower-class bowels of the fourth largest city in the world , circa 1952 . This is the film version of Hubert Selby Jr . ' s unrelentingly pessimistic 1964 novel " Last Exit to Brooklyn " . In the film medium , the material makes a sideways , but successful , impression ; this is an exceptional drama . There are many great sub-plots , and performances ; but , mainly , the film focuses on the character stories involving beautiful young prostitute Jennifer Jason Leigh ( as Tral ) , and striking bisexual union leader Stephen Lang ( as Harry Black ) . Writer Selby has said , " Sometimes , we have the absolute certainty that there's something inside us that's so hideous and monstrous that , if we ever search it out , we won't be able to stand looking at it . But , it's when we're willing to come face to face with that demon , that we face the angel . " Selby's brutal , heart-wrenching treatment of its characters would not have been as successful a film without an extraordinary look at the " angel face " referred to in his quote . In a scene not in the book , young Cameron Johann ( as Spook ) , who has a teenage " crush " on Ms . Leigh , happens upon her drunken figure , after she is nearly raped to death . She is resurrected by his tear-stained face , and realizes her fling with soldier Frank Military ( as Steve ) provided fulfilling sexual intimacy . The scene implicitly offers salvation to Mr . Lang , who , after attempting sex with an underage boy , has been crucified . Still , the film can't shed some " dock-time " , for rancid sexual one-sidedness . Director Uli Edel , cinematographer Stefan Czapsky , editor Peter Przygodda , and musician Mark Knopfler are award-worthy . Jennifer Jason Leigh won several well-deserved awards , but no Oscar ; and , there are at least five performances worthy of a " Best Supporting Actor " nomination . From the central roles , to the smallest " walk on " player ; this film is an example of " ensemble acting " at its best . Its shocking content must have put off a lot of viewers , at the time ; yet , " Last Exit to Brooklyn " succeeds because its violence is not mindless .

452361	15896852	45793	9.0	From Montgomery Clift to Eternity	Fred Zinnemann's " From Here to Eternity " is really more of a soap opera than a war story . Still , it is very well done , and very entertaining . The main attraction isn't World War II , or the soap opera story lines - the main attractions in " From Here to Eternity " are the actors ' performances . Montgomery Clift's is the " main attraction " performance . He makes his character the central figure , despite other story lines , and his performance is mesmerizing . Every look Clift gives , every facial tic , every syllable is fascinating to watch . And , it's all very natural ? very character-driven . Not that all the others aren't terrific , too . Burt Lancaster is a close second , and everyone performs exceptionally well . Mr . Clift's performance helps elevate both the other performances , and the film in general . Check out how great he makes all the other actors , " look " simply by playing a bugle . This is a case where an actor's performance affects both the other players in the scene , and even leaves its impressions in scenes where the actor doesn't appear . If you take Clift out of the film , you have a much more ordinary movie . I'm not sure , however , what / if the film is trying to say about war - is it making a statement of some kind ? The main story is : Will Mr . Clift's character box ( fight ) ? or , won't he fight ( box ) ? I guess he is bullied into fighting , but does not initiate fighting ( he blinds a man , symbolically , by knocking him out in an unseen fight ) . I am not sure if I got the film's message , or even if there was one . I would have also made either MORE EXPLICIT or MORE SUBTLE the whole prostitution part - it was a place to have sex during the time , I guess . Donna Reed and the other women were prostitutes , I guess . Since they couldn't make it more explicit , they toned it down to make us really think these men went to town so they could exchange " nice " smiles with " nice " women . Elsewhere , Mr . Lancaster and Ms . Kerr's sound like they've had physical relations , when , it looked , to me , like they'd only been hit by a wave . I know this was the ' 50s , but filmmakers had developed many subtle ways of relaying this information ? for the prior half century ! So , what it boils down to : This is a great wartime soap opera , with great performances .

452880	15896852	32701	9.0	A Killer Opening and a Dead Letter Ending	Bette Davis wields a gun well , firing shot after shot into a man , in the killer opening of " The Letter " . Do not miss the opening minutes of this film . Then , the story unfolds - Bette ( as Leslie ) is the respected wife of upstanding Singapore plantation owner George Brent ( as Robert Crosbie ) . Ms . Davis claims the dead man was an old acquaintance who entered and attempted rape . Davis ' story is not questioned ; then , a man goes to lawyer James Stephenson ( as Howard Joyce ) with a letter from Davis to the dead man , which contradicts Davis ' story . Davis ' performance is masterful ; in the opening she is able to arouse viewer suspicion without ever actually saying anything or indicating guilt , directly . Mr . Brent and Mr . Stephenson are appropriately supporting in Davis presence ; they seem to often play opposite a commanding actress in showcase film . Gale Sondergaard is startlingly effective as the wife of Davis ' victim . William Wyler and Tony Gaudio directed and photographed artfully . The entire production is superb , with a slight letdown as the story comes to confusing end . The Letter ( 1940 ) William Wyler - Bette Davis , Herbert Marshall , James Stephenson , Gale Sondergaard
453651	15896852	52618	9.0	Chariots of the Gods	Charlton Heston ( as Judah Ben-Hur ) grows up in Judea , around the same time as Jesus Christ . A wealthy Jew , Mr . Heston maintains his princely lifestyle , despite the Roman occupation of his land . After a number of years , Heston encounters old friend Stephen Boyd ( as Messala ) , a Roman . Heston soon discovers that politics does not , in every case , make strange bedfellows ; as Mr . Boyd is the steadfast leader of the occupying Roman forces . Soon , the political upheaval threatens Heston's freedom , and life ? " State-of-the-art " epic , from William Wyler and the outstanding MGM cast and crew . Relatively speaking , this film is not as " original " as the 1925 version ; still , it's a very worthy update , with superlative production values . With a few exceptions , the film looks very natural , unlike the increasingly tired animated " look " used for big productions some decades later . The film's lighting , scenes , and direction are very aesthetically appealing . The supporting characterizations are better than those in the older version . Christianity remains respectfully restrained ; arguably , the amount of Christian faith demonstrated by Heston is unnecessarily subdued . Heston takes some getting used to , as the young Jewish hero ; in fact , he looks more convincing as a Roman , especially after his " adoption " by Jack Hawkins ( as Quintus Arrius ) . An interesting , but unacceptable-at-the-time , idea might have been for Heston and Boyd to switch roles ; Boyd appears capable of handling either " Judah " or " Messala " . Still , Heston wins you over ; his scenes in the " slave boat " , and the reunification with his leper mother are outstandingly played . Boyd's characterization is extraordinary ; watching the way his eyes dart over Heston , in their first scenes together , lends credence to co-writer Gore Vidal assertion there was a homosexual subtext planned for the characters . Realistically , homosexual relations were not all that uncommon among the ancient Romans . Although , this was not likely to be found in the Lew Wallace novel , it does help explain the otherwise inexplicable love / hate relationship between the " Judah " and " Messala " characters . The entire supporting cast does very well , it must have been difficult for award nominators to single anyone out . But , in addition to those mentioned above , Haya Harareet's " Esther " and Hugh Griffith's " Sheik Ilderim " most definitely make an impression . The film's weakest moments occur during the very fake looking " sea battle " sequence ; surprisingly , the old 1925 version is much more consistently exciting . Both films ' " chariot races " are essential thrill rides . Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) William Wyler - Charlton Heston , Stephen Boyd , Jack Hawkins , Hugh Griffith

SO , after narrowly escaping a head-on collision due to fatigue and bad weather , Howell sleepily decides to pick up a sopping wet hitchhiker . . . " My mother told me never to do this , " but , " I wanted to help him , and I was tired . I thought he might help me stay awake , " Howell explains . Unfortunately , " The Hitcher " turns out to be maniacal serial killer Rutger Hauer ( as John Ryder ) , in the middle of a bloody rampage . Mr . Hauer confesses he is dismembering drivers who pick him up . Hauer terrorizes Howell for the remainder of the film ? " I want you to stop me . " Outstandingly paced suspense and blood-splattering gore , from director Robert Harmon , photographer John Seale , and writer Eric Red . The Harmon / Seale / Red team make this " road trip " a classic exploitation . Casting Howell in the lead exceeds any expectations . Jennifer Jason Leigh ( as Nash ) makes a perfect semi-trashy western waitress ( she serves as a " wishbone " for the men ) . Mark Isham's score is great . And , Hauer's villainous " Best Supporting Actor " - worthy performance would define gay subtext , IF he were more subtle . The Hitcher ( 1986 ) Robert Harmon - C .

453406	15896852	23948	9.0	John Barrymore and Marie Dressler are the Main Course	David O . Selznick and MGM's " Dinner at Eight " is a great comedy-drama follow-up to " Grand Hotel " . Although it seems to have been less critically acclaimed ( back then , at least ) , it's actually a little better . The story , characters , and setting are more related ; they are all affected by the " Great Depression " , and involved , directly or indirectly , with Lionel Barrymore ( as Oliver Jordan ) and Billie Burke ( as Millicent Jordan ) ' s planned dinner party . One story , or subplot , in " Dinner at Eight " is much superior to the rest of the dramatic elements ; it is the story of washed-up alcoholic actor John Barrymore ( as Larry Renault ) . While never less than good , no other story strand approaches Mr . Barrymore's riveting mini-drama . Barrymore and Lee Tracy ( as Max Kane ) perform especially well together . The other truly exceptional performance honor goes to Marie Dressler ( as Carlotta Vance ) . Ms . Dressler doesn't have her own " play " ; instead , her character serves an interlocking purpose . And , she carries the rest of the movie . Director George Cukor , photographer William Daniels , and the several credited writers are noteworthy , particularly for the Barrymore / Tracy scenes . Ms . Burke , Jean Harlow ( as Kitty Packard ) , and Louise Closser Hale ( as Hattie Loomis ) are among the others in top form . Watch Barrymore's increasingly desperate " Larry Renault " and Dressler's wise overseeing " Carlotta Vance " , for iconic performances from stars at their peak ; in , at least , the best supporting characterizations of the year .

452519	15896852	23649	9.0	A Vampire Film That Doesn't Suck	While touring the French countryside , dream prone Julian West ( as Allan Grey / David Gray ) stops at an enigmatic inn , next to an eerie castle . Mr . West meets the mysterious " Lord of the Manor " ( Maurice Schutz ) , and becomes involved with the castle's shadowy denizens . Of particular interest are pretty victimized Sybille Schmitz ( as Léone ) and distressed damsel Rena Mandel ( as Gisèle ) . A conveniently published book explains ( believe it or not ! ) that there is a monstrous vampire in the mist ( Henriette Gérard ) , assisted by a frightening old doctor ( Jan Hieronimko ) . This is an anemic " Vampyr " story , substantially elevated by artfully direction and photography by Carl Theodor Dreyer and Rudolph Maté ( with Louis Née ) . Although the plot isn't very intriguing , the visuals provided by Mr . Dreyer and crew are always impressive , especially West's dreamy burial sequence , which must have influenced Ingmar Bergman ( and many others ) . The ending , an update of D . W . Griffith's " A Corner in Wheat " ( 1909 ) , is also notable . Dreyer's inspirational playing with light and shadows raises his " Vampyr " far , far above its relatively disappointing storyline .

453288	15896852	59017	9.0	How the West Was Fun	This movie is A LOT of fun . As it begins , Jane Fonda is about to be hanged . Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye appear throughout , dramatizing events with their singing of " The Ballad of Cat Ballou " . We don't know Fonda's crime - but , we are flashbacked to tell the story . Ms . Fonda comes home from school to find her father killed by a corrupt town . Fonda's gang assembles - Michael Callan , whom she meets in bed , Tom Nardini , an Indian ranchman , and Dwayne Hickman , a young uncle . Since none of them can shoot , they hire gunslinger Lee Marvin for $50 . 00 . Sadly , Mr . Marvin is delivered in a drunken stupor ; he can hardly stand up , let alone defend Jane . Director Elliot Silverstein keeps the pace very lively ; there is always something going on , or about to happen - most of it funny . The movie is a " spoof " of the western . If you can't stomach western spoofery , you may not enjoy the film , which could be your loss . The scene I found funniest ( but not the laugh out loud funniest ) was when Mr . Nardini was preparing Mr . Marvin for the big confrontation . Nardini takes out a girdle to squeeze on Marvin's body - you can picture dozens of aging western actors going through the same thing just to appear in front of the movie camera ! I imagine there were A LOT of long faces on western actors , while watching " Cat Ballou " ( if they dared ) . Jay C Flippen and some western regulars give the movie some authenticity - they must have seen their share of drunken western actors . Nardini is also an Indian who does NOT ACT LIKE A WESTERN MOVIE Indian . He corrects educated Fonda's grammar ( " Whom " ) . Watch how he " scalps " someone in the early brawl ? watch his " salute " to the prepared-to-fight Marvin . And , Marvin is GREAT throughout - note the different ways he plays his role ( s ) , making the role so much FUN to watch . Fonda is excellent too ? always staying true to her character ; as Marvin takes the movie's looser reigns , Fonda plays it steady . EVERYONE is great , actually . The other young men , Callan & Hickman . . . always right . Even the minor cast players ( " My name is ? " ) . . . Perhaps the story went in a couple of directions for the sake of an additional skit or two , but who cares ? Just Enjoy ! Cat Ballou ( 1965 ) Elliot Silverstein - Jane Fonda .

He also plays " matchmaker " for Joan Bennett and Anthony Bushell . Arliss ' performance is captivating , despite the datedness of this early " talking " movie . Nobody can equal Arliss , but I did like Ms . Lloyd as his sparring partner . Ms . Bennett was good , also - a cut above her average " stand around and look beautiful " films from this period . The players were elevated , possibly , in Arliss ' presence . There are some noticeable ways they could have made a better film , by waiting even a year or two . I would like to see the film restored ; moreover , I would accept some tinkering / editing for a new version ( while preserving the original , of course ) . If you like classic " one-man-show " acting performances , it's hard to beat Arliss in this movie . He performs like a spider spinning its web - capturing everything in sight , including the audience . Be careful ! Disraeli ( 1929 ) Alfred E .

453559	15896852	2553	9.0	Making Movies Magical	Great early film short , directed superbly by D . W . Griffith . In it , Lillian and Dorothy Gish play sisters ( is that ever inspired casting ? ) terrorized by a wicked housekeeper and her male companion . They have the Gish sisters locked in a room , and terrorized them by firing a gun through a hole in the wall . It doesn't sound like much , but the direction makes in exciting ( there is a race to rescue them after they are able to make a phone call ) . Lillian and Dorothy Gish look extraordinary on film , together , in " An Unseen Enemy " ; though , the situation more than a little implausible . The Gish sisters are radiant . Also noteworthy are the scenes with Robert Harron which open and close the drama , earning him a Kiss from Dorothy Gish .

You will immediately notice the breathtaking Montana scenery - photography by Philippe Rousselot , direction by Robert Redford , with an obviously adept cast and crew . The kids playing the younger Macleans were quite an asset ; I did recognize Joseph Gordon-Levitt in an impressive debut ( though not his first ) . As I was watching , I thought : well , it looks all nice , but what's happening ? I was unsure about the film's focus . The film is often slow and confusing , even if you are familiar with the Norman MacLean story ; and , this is a somewhat alternate version / vision of the original written work . And , I realized what I was watching . It happened twenty minutes ( or so ) after the kids " grew up " - this is the story of Norman Maclean's remembrances ? the touching stones of his life . They may not be the things you'd believe an old man remembers ; but , by the end of the film , you know . You'll understand the focus on his brother , with that magical quality that just slipped away ? Perhaps , there was no perfection there ; but , you'll know why Norman sees it . You'll know why that memory of the perfect fly fisherman is there . Just a few other thoughts : At the risk of over-analyzing , I felt the characters of Norman , Paul , their father , and Redford merging into ONE character at the end of the film ; I wonder if Redford intended it that way ? His direction , narration , and lead performances seemed blend together ? Directing , Preaching , Fishing , the River - it all runs together ; and , we're all water . The end of the film is very powerful . A River Runs Through It ( 1992 ) Robert Redford - Brad Pitt , Craig Sheffer , Tom Skerritt , Brenda Blethyn

When Pickford admires " The New York Hat " in a downtown shop window , Minister Barrymore decides to buy it for her - - which ignites gossipers ; they link Mary and the Minister in a " romantic " scandal . Watch Pickford act before , with , and after " The New York Hat " . Her performance is great ; she plays her part as a young woman , not a little girl , simply and effectively .

452643	15896852	289879	9.0	Come Back When You Grow Up	This review recommends you watch the " directors ' cut " before sampling the " theatrical version " of " The Butterfly Effect " . Also , it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments , good and bad , until after viewing ; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up . The writer / director team of Eric Bress and J . Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments , or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate , thought out , well paced , and imaginative drama . The protagonist is unstuck young " Evan Treborn " ( played by Ashton Kutcher , John Patrick Amedori , and Logan Lerman ) . The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends : " Kayleigh " ( Amy Smart , Irene Gorovaia , and Sarah Widdows ) , " Tommy " ( William Lee Scott , Jesse James , and Cameron Bright ) , and " Lenny " ( Elden Henson , Kevin Schmidt , and Jake Kaese ) . Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father ( Eric Stoltz ) , and Evan's loving mother ( Melora Walters ) are the main parental figures . To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement . The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable , and rarely achieves at the level evident . This is also a technically beautiful film . Be prepared . The character " George Miller " is a pedophile , who has obviously abused his children ( off screen ) . " Mr . Miller " invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera ; it is a non-erotic , tastefully filmed scene . But , the violence , especially between the young children , is disturbing to the extreme ; certainly , it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse . In the case of " The Butterfly Effect " , artistic license trumps irreparable damages . " I'll come back for you " indeed . The Butterfly Effect ( 2004 ) Eric Bress , J .

452733	15896852	43465	9.0	Unbecoming an Officer	Kirk Douglas is very effective as a police detective with an surprise connection to someone he encounters on the job . Mr . Douglas ' performance is outstanding ; and , the supporting players all move around him like a finely tuned clock . Of them , I thought William Bendix was superb , very natural - everyone is fine , in fact , as directed by William Wyler . Of the little stories , I liked the young couple - the thief and girlfriend . I had to go to see the IMDb comments to find out what was happening in the film - I really couldn't understand some of the dialog Since the film deals with " issues " considered too delicate to really talk about in a movie , you have to really pay attention . To reveal more would spoil the film - but , its weakness is that it couldn't really be totally " realistic " due to the era when it was produced . Observe , for example , the amount of profanity uttered in that precinct ! The strongest word used is " tramp " . " Detective Story " does manage to bring its characters and story to the viewer , and scores points for realism ( despite some likely censorship ) . Keeping that in mind , it's an essential character study . Detective Story ( 1951 ) William Wyler - Kirk Douglas , Eleanor Parker , William Bendix , Lee Grant
453223	15896852	20025	9.0	The Sound of Silence	Working class Irishmen Lars Hanson ( as Gypo Nolan ) and Carl Harbord ( as Francis McPhillipp ) are members of an anti-establishment " Party " , where politics is punctuated with gunfire . While maintaining a friendship with his comrade , Mr . Hanson is obviously interested in Mr . Harbord's fickle moll , the lovely Lya de Putti ( as Katie Fox ) . After Harbord kills the local police chief ( during a gunfight ) he is driven underground ; leaving Ms . de Putti free to hook up with Hanson . Then , when Harbord surfaces to visit his mother , Hanson suspects he is seeing de Putti . So , Hanson becomes " The Informer " , hounded by detective Warwick Ward ( as Dan Gallagher ) . Fascinating , superb direction from Arthur Robison , and gorgeous photography from Theodor Sparkuhl and Werner Brandes , highlight this undiscovered classic . Director Robison and crew are always moving the picture ; even a background window is filled - - if only with the shadows of passing figures . The crowds of people are a moving backdrop for the film's atmospheric array of shadows , alleys , streets , police , and prostitutes . Although " The Informer " is labeled " A British International Picture " , it might more accurately be described as a " German Film Noir " . John Ford re-made " The Informer " in 1935 ; and , obviously , he was influenced by this version . Heavily accented leading players Hanson ( Swedish ) and de Putti ( Hungarian ) found their film careers killed by talking pictures , regrettably . Their performances are excellent ? . . . then . . . After about 45 minutes , the film changes from " silent " to " talking " . The switch works as a dramatic device ; although , it certainly couldn't have been planned by cast and crew . More probably , the studio ordered the change , as the popularity of all-silent films plummeted . The decision might have been a sound one ; however , the voices dubbing Hanson and de Putti are inadequate . A restoration of " The Informer " , with improved dubbing , could remedy the situation . The eerie " your mother has forgiven me " ending , with Hanson achieving Salvation , must remain , however . If , for some reason , you feel inclined to leave this version of " The Informer " unfinished , don't dare miss the last few minutes of work from actor Hanson and director Robison .
452825	15896852	119978	9.0	Matt Damon Passes the Bar for Francis Ford Coppola	" Francis Ford Coppola directs and scripts an exciting , star-packed adaptation of John Grisham's novel about an idealistic young attorney who takes on the case of a lifetime , " exactly as promotional synopsis promises , " Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor , a rookie lawyer in over his head on a high-profile case . Opposing him : an army of seasoned legal sharks ( led by Jon Voight ) . On Rudy's side : Deck Shifflet ( Danny DeVito ) , a feisty ' paralawyer ' who specializes in flunking the bar exam . Rudy's chances are slim to none - until he uncovers a trail of corruption that might lead to the one thing that could win his case : the truth . " Mr . Damon's almost simultaneous participation in " Good Will Hunting " probably blew some of the wind out of this film's sails ; in hindsight , " The Rainmaker " shines brightly , and includes some award-worthy work . The most obvious nomination for " Supporting Actress " would be veteran Teresa Wright's lovely swansong as " Miss Birdie " ( it turned out to be the last of many great performances ) . Additionally , Mr . DeVito and Mr . Voight should have received some " Supporting Actor " consideration . The film features many strong characterizations , with Damon's lead providing perfect counterbalance . He , director Coppola , and novelist John Grisham are a formula worth repeating . Coppola manages to adapt Mr . Grisham's story successfully to film ; and , he keeps the staid courtroom sequences exciting . The characters played by Claire Danes ( Kelly Riker ) and Johnny Whitworth ( Donny Ray Black ) seem lacking - an additional scene or two , with Damon , would have been nice . The film's thesis rings true , and is expertly concluded . Grisham , Coppola , and Damon are a winning firm .

453022	15896852	52993	9.0	Make the Extraordinarily Suspenseful visit to " Gun Hill "	Don't miss the beginning of this film . Not only is it essential to the whole picture , but it is also a great example of how a filmmaker can show a brutal crime without showing the details on-screen . In the opening , a brutal rape and murder occur ; director John Sturges and the performers relay very effectively what happens , it's the horror in your mind . Kirk Douglas stars , and he is riveting . My favorite of Mr . Douglas ' scenes is when he describes a hanging to Earl Holliman - it's an " award-worthy " performance ; but won none or few , no doubt . The others all perform amicably , too . After Douglas goes to Gun Hill , he sees old friend Anthony Quinn ? watch how Douglas and Mr . Quinn play their first scene and you'll see how good these two actors are . You always have to suspend disbelief in film watching , and a western is a little different . Westerns have their own world , which you accept , or don't . I could not really accept Mr . Quinn and Earl Holliman as father and son , at first . I think it could have been helped if Quinn had done something different with his hair ; he never seemed concerned about thinning or gray hair , so I can't fathom the hair ? it made him look younger than usual . After the movie went on , I decided to just accept that like I accept the rules you accept when you watch a western . Besides , Quinn and Holliman are far to good to replace . Then , add Carolyn Jones . . . Now , I figured , at first , she would have the standard " look pretty and kiss the hero " role - - but , that was not so ; actually , she was given a real good part and had a chance to perform a meaningful acting role . Ms . Jones showed she should have been given more good film roles . So many westerns try build this suspense - - " Last Train from Gun Hill " should have you shaking in your cowboy boots .

453553	15896852	4972	9.0	The Unfortunate Birth of a Clan	As the film itself states , " This is a depiction of the events of the civil war and of the formation of the Ku Klux Klan from the point of view of the American South . " Let that be a warning ! Still , expert motion picture making from D . W . Griffith , G . W . Bitzer , and company . This film should receive a perfect " 10 " - - but the aggravating and overt racist theme is sometimes worse than the actual war . The " Negro race " is , if you think about it , blamed for the Civil War - - beginning with the unbalanced opening : " The bringing of the African to America planted the first seed of disunion . " The " Civil War " depicted in " Birth of a Nation " isn't over until the end of Part 2 ; when Confederates band together as the Ku Klux Klan , and defeat the " Negroes " . In this film , the KKK wins . Part 1 , by the way , is somewhat more tolerable - - but , by the end of Part 2 , the film's message becomes obvious . Note that Jesus Christ makes a God-blessed-this-film appearance . Otherwise , Lillian Gish ( as Elsie Stoneman ) and Henry B . Walthall ( as Ben Cameron ) are extraordinary in the lead roles ; she represents the North , and he represents the South . The Stomeman and Cameron families ' friendship and conflicts , due to the war , would have been a good , singular film focus . Of course , Mr . Walthall's character is a racist hero , but he performs the role exceptionally well . Ms . Gish is at her silent best ; don't miss the scene where , after a date with Walthall , she caresses her bedpost ! Second leads Elmer Clifton ( as Phil Stoneman ) and " daughter of the south " Miriam Cooper ( as Margaret Cameron ) hold their own against the powerful Gish and Walthall . Ms . Cooper has eyes which seem slightly askew in some shots , giving her an eerie quality . Josephine Crowell ( as Mrs . Cameron ) shines , among the more mature performers . Mae Marsh and Violet Wilkey ( both as Flora Cameron ) are quite memorable , also . In a supporting role , Robert Harron ( as Tod Stoneman ) is at Gish-level acting ; don't miss the scene with Harron embracing George Beranger ( as Wade Cameron ) when the " chums " expire on the battleground . Harron makes the scene especially touching . Note that Harron appears later on , in an unexpected role . Joseph Henabery is another appearing in different roles ; he is most memorable as Abraham Lincoln ; the assassination sequence is another film highlight , with Raoul Walsh ( as John Wilkes Booth ) . Harron and Ms . Marsh would be even more dazzling in Griffith's next , " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . Another great scene occurs when Walthall walks unsteadily out of the hospital with Gish , while guard William Freeman gives Gish a last longing sigh . And , it's easy to see why Wallace Reid ( as a blacksmith ) ' s search for Walter Long ( as Gus ) , in " Joe's ginmill " , was a star-making brawl . The Birth of a Nation ( / 15 ) D . W . Griffith - Lillian Gish , Henry B . Walthall , Mae Marsh , Robert Harron
453021	15896852	43338	9.0	We Call It " The Media Circus "	Brilliant film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Kirk Douglas . Hard to describe , better just watch . Mr . Douglas stars as a probable alcoholic newspaperman who milks a story about a man trapped in a cave . You do get the feeling his awareness of human condition ( all humans , not just journalists ) is what's eating away at him . Jan Sterling is a revelation as the blonde Douglas and Bob Arthur pick up - she has lines like , " I don't go to Church , kneeling bags my nylons . " Porter Hall has a great supporting part as a the " Tell The Truth " editor who is first to lap up the lies . " Ace in the Hole " is also know as " The Big Carnival " - currently , ( in real life ) , its called " The Media Circus " . The film grows more horrific every year . The parallels to today's " news " are so obvious they almost need no mention - I would only add that today's media circus events like the big rescue to occur on a Sunday . Ace in the Hole ( 1951 ) Billy Wilder - Kirk Douglas , Jan Sterling , Robert Arthur , Porter Hall
452985	15896852	39431	9.0	The Best Things in Life Are Free	At TAIT University , students more interested in each other , and football , than they are in learning French ( does that sound dated ? ) . June Allyson ( she's Connie ) and Peter Lawford ( he's Tommy ) are the focus of attention . She's the nice librarian interested in the star football player ; he , understandably , attracts the school's most desirable women . Does a plain librarian have a chance to win the star football player ? The screenplay , direction , choreography , and songs all hit the mark in " Good News " . Ms . Allyson and Mr . Lawford are an unlikely duo to head the cast , but they turn in extraordinary performances . Allyson and Lawford mix just the right amount of awkward charm and graceful professionalism to bring the story alive ; it's something rare in musicals of this type . The supporting cast members compliment the leads well . Allyson is at her very best - from her introduction " under the sink " to her careful dropping of book after book during a later scene , she is marvelous . With her character doing double duty as the college librarian , her role of student is believable , despite being relatively older . Lawford is not known as a singer / dancer , but his performance is as charming . Watch how he : studies French , passes a hairbrush to his coach , jumps over a fire hydrant , and puts a handkerchief in his pocket - the quick succession of bits is well-done and subjectively defines the Lawford character . The film is full of little things the characters and director ( Charles Walters ) do to fill out the movie without increasing its running time . Of the great supporting cast , Joan McCracken is certainly the most valuable . Her " Pass that Peace Pipe " with Ray McDonald ( another outstanding performance ) is a soundtrack highlight . It's " political incorrectness " really doesn't hold up , in context . Of the mature players , Jane Green is just delightful - note the scene with Allyson and Connie Gilchrist ( Mrs . Drexel ) ; it's when Allyson give the older woman a " script " to " play-act " , explaining how Tommy's family has lost its fortune in Pickles due to the great Cucumber Blight . The supposed " error " in placing the film in the 1920s with most of it looking like the 1940s actually HELPS . I would have titled the movie " The Best Things in Life Are Free " , though , and re-recorded the vocals on the finale . Still , " Good News " is an example of this type of film at its graceful , exuberant best . Good News ( 1947 ) Charles Walters - June Allyson , Peter Lawford , Joan McCracken , Ray McDonald
452840	15896852	289992	9.0	DeathWatch ( ? or Sex , Lies , and Videotape )	University of Austin philosophy professor Kevin Spacey ( as David Gale ) is a well-known death penalty opponent ; ironically , he is about to be executed for the rape / murder of co-protester Laura Linney ( as Constance Harraway ) . With four days to live , Mr . Spacey tells beautiful reporter Kate Winslet ( as Elizabeth " Bitsey " Bloom ) his story - vehemently asserting he did NOT kill Ms . Linney . Ms . Winslet listens to Spacey explain the events leading up to the crime , which we see in " flashbacks " . As she hears Spacey's testimonial , Winslet begins to investigate the unfolding mystery , with smoking intern Gabriel Mann ( as Zack Stemmons ) assisting . The final , final twist wasn't a complete shock ; but , there is a great deal of welcome uncertainty throughout most of the film . Alan Parker's " The Life of David Gale " is a roller-coaster - managing to be suspenseful , unpredictable , and thought-provoking . The part that comes closest to misfiring is Spacey's drunken rant about Plato , Socrates , and Aristotle . But , the character was , at the time , a philosophy teacher battling alcoholism . In fact , Charles Randolph's story is very tightly written ; with wall posters , stuffed animals , and car trouble all making complete sense . Winsome Winslet and Mr . Mann are the " present " story co-stars , with " flaming liberal " Spacey and Linney leading the " flashback " cast . The two different story lines are crosscut beautifully . The acting is exceptional , with Linney probably outdistancing the others - she certainly has the most demanding role , which she performs courageously , and without a double . How does an A-list actress , like Linney , receive no " Best Supporting Actress " consideration for her work in this film ? As a movie pair , Winslet and Mann are quite impressive . Mr . Randolph , director Parker , and the cast make both the major and minor characters memorable . The film could have been given a more interesting title than " The Life of David Gale " ; too bad " sex , lies , and videotape " and " DeathWatch " were unavailable . In the past , this basic story appeared under titles like " Capitol Punishment " , " Circumstantial Evidence " , and " " Beyond a Reasonable Doubt " . However labeled , this is one of the more engaging takes on the ancient law . The Life of David Gale ( 2003 ) Alan Parker - Kate Winslet , Kevin Spacey , Laura Linney , Gabriel Mann
452432	15896852	5078	9.0	Sex , Race , and Sadism ! ( with Fannie Ward , Sessue Hayakawa , and Cecil B . DeMille )	" East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet . " Fannie Ward ( as Edith Hardy ) is an extravagant socialite who is told by husband Jack Dean ( as Dick Hardy ) she must cut down on spending , as he meets with business failures ; instead , she takes $10 , 000 from the Red Cross fund she is entrusted with , and gambles it on a " sure thing " - sure enough , she loses the money . Desperate to replace the money , Ms . Ward turns to wealthy party host Sessue Hayakawa ( as Tori aka Arakau ) , who is secretly attracted to her . Mr . Hayakawa gives Ward the money , but wants a sexual encounter the next night . Then , Mr . Dean makes a Stock Market killing , and is rich again . Ward takes $10 , 000 to pay off Hayakawa , but he won't bargain ? This is a lurid melodrama , filled with sex , race , and sadism ; but , it is redeemed by several factors . Cecil B . DeMille directed artfully ; his use of light and shadows is remarkable . The portrayals of Fannie Ward ( as " The Cheat " Edith Hardy ) and Sessue Hayakawa ( as Tori aka Arakau ) are among the finest of the era . You'll want to watch this film with the remote nearby , as there are a few scenes you may want to see re-played immediately . The Japanese community objected , understandably , to the film's racially prejudicial appeal ; so Hayakawa's character was changed from Japanese Hishuru Tori to Burmese Haka Arakau , for a 1918 re-release . Presumably , the Burmese community was not amused . The Cheat ( / 15 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Fannie Ward , Sessue Hayakawa , Jack Dean , James Neill
453319	15896852	8362	9.0	Hart of the Country	Outside the pale of civilization , two western Kings roam . One is a wild horse ; the other is William S . Hart ( as Ice Harding ) , evil leader of the most daring band of outlaws in the Nevadas . Not surprisingly , Mr . Hart is the man to tame the wild Pinto , which he names " King " . Then , masked for thieving , Hart robs a coach containing Sylvia Breamer ( as Betty Werdin ) . The seemingly sweet Ms . Breamer is traveling with her " Uncle " , Milton Ross ( as Admiral Bates ) . Hart thinks Breamer is , " The most wonderful being he has ever seen . " In town , Breamer's icky wonderfulness begins to melt Hart's icy wickedness . But , Hart doesn't know Breamer's secret ? The first of Hart's Paramount period ( though , second released ) is a definitive high point ; " The Narrow Trail " is one of the best examples of the " Hart western " ( if you're looking for one to sample ) . The star , director Lambert Hillyer , and photographer Joe August are at their best , creating a beautiful landscape for the Hart formula to play upon . The film is perfectly paced . Hart's horse , " Fritz " ( as " King " ) , makes a screen " return " , which fits amazingly well into the storyline . And , Hart has one of his most conscientious " man to horse " talks . Best of all is the twist on a recurring Hart feature ; to wit , an otherwise ordinary woman attracts Hart with an allurement only he can see ; but , this one's refreshingly different .

Lady Agnes Ayres ( as Diana Mayo ) , the orphaned daughter of an English poet , visits Arabia , and catches Mr . Valentino's eye . The modern Ms . Ayres wants to visit the local casino , where Valentino entertains , but she is turned away . Furious , Ayres borrows a harem dancer's costume , and sneaks into the action . Discovered , and ousted , Ayres is nevertheless attracted to the dreamy Valentino , who has decided to abduct her ? Unexpectedly , Valentino's " Sheik " caricature became one of filmdom's most memorable roles ; in fact , it might be considered , stylistically , Valentino's greatest . He must have had mixed feelings about the film ; as Valentino admittedly approached acting as an art , which this isolated performance doesn't ( arguably ) show . Still , it is a great , however misunderstood , performance . Ayres is a good feminine conquest ; she is lovely , but never ravishing enough to move the spotlight too far away from the star . Adolphe Menjou ( as Raoul de Saint Hubert ) lends both subtext , and a good performance . The presence of barbarous Walter Long ( as Omair ) , coupled with the love of Ayres , helps reform Ahmed's immoral character . The supporting and bit players are uniformly interesting . Importantly , director George Melford and photographer William Marshall give " The Sheik " a very crisp , moving style . Roger Bellon's soundtrack is one of the best retrospective soundtracks composed for an old silent . Whatever its criticisms , Valentino's bulging " Sheik " is difficult to disregard ; it remains a definitive classic .

452687	15896852	29870	9.0	James Cagney Gives it Up for " The Dead End Kids "	One of the best of its type , " Angels with Dirty Faces " epitomizes the " gangster " and " juvenile delinquent " pictures of the 1930s ( and 1940s ) . These are the films showing how unfortunate circumstances turn young men into hardened criminals . It's the " Nature vs . Nurture " argument . And , don't waste any time wondering about this film's stance - the title says it all - if you rub that dirty criminal's face hard enough , you'll find a hidden Angel . This is the case with tough guy James Cagney ( as Rocky Sullivan ) , who landed in reform school for stealing , and was seduced into a life of crime . It may be too late for Cagney , but not for the younger generation of dirty-faced angels known as " The Dead End Kids " , who worship the charismatic gangster . At least , that's the way scarred priest Pat O'Brien ( as Jerry Connolly ) sees things . Father O'Brien , who escaped Cagney's fate , wants salvation for the little tough guys . Cagney's courageous , shoulder-rolling turn as " Rocky " is entrancing ; absolutely , he deserved a " Best Actor " award - which the " on target " in the 1930s New York Film Critics delivered . Directed by Michael Curtiz , the classic line-up of " Dead End Kids " - Billy Halop as " Soapy " , Bobby Jordan as " Swing " , Leo Gorcey as " Bim " , Gabriel Dell as " Pasty " , Huntz Hall as " Crab " , and Bernard Punsly as " Hunky " - are a symphony of spitting , smoking , and ( mostly ) smacked upside the head young punks . The memorable Warner Brothers supporting cast includes rheumy-eyed lawyer Humphrey Bogart ( as James Frazier ) , sultry Ann Sheridan ( as Laury Ferguson ) , and perfectly cast Frankie Burke ( as a young James Cagney ) . " Social Consciousness " - raising films can often trip over themselves , so don't watch this one in the wrong frame of mind .

452475	15896852	29843	9.0	In Living Color	It's difficult to imagine anyone ( with a straight face ) filming a more definitive version of " Robin Hood " than this one . This is the story of the green clad crusader and his band of " Merry Men " ; to combat injustice , they rob from the rich and give to the poor . Errol Flynn ( as Robin Hood ) , Olivia de Havilland ( as Lady Marion Fitzwalter ) , Basil Rathbone ( as Sir Guy of Gisbourne ) , Claude Rains ( as Prince John ) , Patric Knowles ( as Will Starlett ) and Eugene Palette ( as Friar Tuck ) head up a great cast . Alan Hale ( as Little John ) most notably reprises his role , from the previous standard " Robin Hood " ( 1922 ) . Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito set stunning standards in color photography . And , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's soundtrack punctuates the picture perfectly .
453471	15896852	14532	9.0	Church of the Poison Mind	Cecil B . DeMille's Paramount EPIC " The Ten Commandments " tells the Old Testament's " Moses " story during its first hour . The " special effects " highlights are : Theodore Roberts ( as Moses ) parting the Red Sea , and the Biblical patriarch's thunderous receiving of God's commandments . The production is first rate throughout . After about fifty minutes of spectacle , the film switches to a " Modern Story " - wherein Mr . DeMille seeks to tell a morality story involving " The Ten Commandments " . For the main story ( the more memorable Moses segments were a mere " prologue " ) , DeMille introduces the McTavish brothers - saintly carpenter Richard Dix ( as John ) , and partying atheist Rod La Rocque ( as Dan ) . While Mr . Dix stays home to read The Bible , with dear mother Edythe Chapman ( as Martha McTavish ) , Mr . La Rocque breaks Commandments , with lovely Leatrice Joy ( as Mary Leigh ) . Of course , Dix falls in love with Ms . Joy , after she becomes his brother's wife ? DeMille's morality tale is extremely heavy-handed , but nevertheless enticing , and expertly directed . The " Biblical " and " Modern " story format recalls D . W . Griffith's superior " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . The all-star cast ( it's 1923 , remember ) performs exceptionally , with La Rocque being seen in one of his finest performances . As any actor will tell you , La Rocque was halfway there , upon receiving the " bad brother " role , over Dix - and , La Rocque runs away with the film . His is a " Best Actor " - worthy performance . Nefarious Nita Naldi ( as Sally Lung ) leads a strong supporting cast . All things considered , this one's a lot more fun than the 1956 re-make .

452890	15896852	212720	9.0	You Can Make It If You Cry	After his stunning 1990s success , Steven Spielberg satisfied those salivating to despise him , with " A . I . Artificial Intelligence " . The poised knives could be released , at last ! So , the initial reactions took an undeserved negative tone , while , still , offering praise to individual efforts too obviously evidenced in the production to ignore . This is really an excellent , thought-provoking film . The beginning of the film could have been improved by combining the character " Professor Hobby " into " Henry Swinton " . The resulting " Henry Swinton " would , then , more closely resemble " Geppetto " from " Pinocchio " . This would , necessarily , make " David " the image of their dead son . Then , the parents ' conflict would be the focus of the film's first act . This would have made the relationship between the parents much more dynamic ; and , it would throw the mother " Monica " ( Frances O'Connor ) into incalculable conflict with the robotic " David " , resolved in the film's already powerful ending . Mr . Spielberg marvelously breathes life into Stanley Kubrick's unrealized project ( he died before realizing this dream work ) ; and , he directs Haley Joel Osment ( as David ) to a peak performance level . Mr . Osment , Jude Law ( as Gigolo Joe ) , and " Teddy " ( voiced by Jack Angel ) are an unforgettable " mecha " ( short for " mechanical " ) trio of humane robots . Janusz Kaminski and the Spielberg crew are magical . Good night , David . Pleasant dreams . A . I .

453115	15896852	18311	9.0	A Classic Silent Comedy	Poor barmaid Marion Davies ( as Tina ) is the drudge of the " Red Mill Tavern " ; she is always " in Dutch " , meaning ( wittily ) both " in trouble " and " in Holland " ( this comedy's setting ) . Ms . Davies ' only friend is Ignatz , a little white mouse , who lives in her shoe . One day , Davies sees Owen Moore ( as Dennis Wheat ) ice skating ; and , she is attracted to him . She ventures out to find Mr . Moore surrounded by female admirers , but manages a meeting . Davies must struggle to win Moore's heart , after she learns he is a Governor , betrothed to a wealthy maiden . " The Red Mill " is a very funny silent comedy , which still works , today , thanks to expert work by director Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle ( incognito as " William Goodrich " ) . Davies and Moore are a winning comic team ; and , Davies ' starring performance is particularly fine . Louise Fazenda , Snitz Edwards , and Karl Dane are perfect in supporting roles . And , Ignatz is a delightful mouse . Many of the title cards , by Joseph Farnham , from Henry Blossom's original play , are hilarious : " My name's Tina " " Mine's Wheat . Wheat-Tina . We ought to get together for breakfast . " " She's got a beautiful chassis . " " Never mind the chassis . Wait till you see what she's got under the hood . " " I never believed in love at first sight until I took a second look at you . " " I'm through ! There's too much traffic on your ladder . " " You must be twins . No one man could be so dumb ! " Of course , the visual situations are necessary to fully enjoy the comedy . " The Red Mill " is also extremely well-photographed , by Hendrik Sartov , who worked with D . W Griffith and Lillian Gish . The exciting finale , with George Siegmann whipping Davies , and locking her in the windmill , is almost an " homage " to Griffith and Siegmann's similar treatment of Ms . Gish , in some well-known Griffith films . But , what happened to poor Ignatz ? A final pan should have revealed the mouse was alive and well .
452936	15896852	50798	9.0	A Rare Breed	Texas teenager Tommy Kirk ( as Travis Coates ) is directed to assume the role " man of the house " when his father leaves on a three-to-four hour cattle round-up . Young Kirk is to watch over the ranch , with mother Dorothy McGuire ( as Katie ) , and little brother Kevin Corcoran ( as Arliss ) . While tending the corn field , a wayward dog causes Kirk trouble , scaring a mule and ruining Kirk's day . Kirk has no use for " Old Yeller " , but brother Corcoran loves the " ugly , lop-eared mongrel " . The dog stays in the picture , but for how long ? A classic family story . Kirk and Yeller make terrible first impressions on each other . Kirk does not like " Old Yeller " . He tries to manage the dog as he thinks an " adult " would , and recalls an older family pet as irreplaceable . Yeller is not fooled by Kirk's growing pains , and the two become hopelessly bonded . Eventually , the story becomes almost . . . Shakespearian . Robert Stevenson directed , with a great Disney production team . Credit must be given to Fred Gipson and William Tunberg's mature screenplay - and , especially to Kirk , who performs his part superbly . All things being equal , Kirk should have received some " Best Actor " award notices for his role in " Old Yeller " . It's difficult to imagine this film working without his sincere , captivating performance . Little Corcoran has more typical Disney role ; his scenes with Kirk ( discussing Heaven ) and Chuck Connors are nicely done . Try to ignore the garish Indian headdress . Young Beverly Washburn ( as Lisbeth Searcy ) plays her " puppy love " for Kirk just right . Ms . McGuire and father Fess Parker ( as Jim ) are realistic , loving , and supportive . " Old Yeller " is , truly , the " best doggone dog in the west . " Old Yeller ( 1957 ) Robert Stevenson - Tommy Kirk , Dorothy McGuire , Kevin Corcoran , Fess Parker
453696	15896852	67893	9.0	Simply the Best Movie Monte Ever Made with James Taylor & Dennis Wilson	Rock star good-looking dragsters James Taylor ( as The Driver ) and Dennis Wilson ( as The Mechanic ) stop at service stations and roadside diners . At one café , sexy stowaway Laurie Bird ( as The Girl ) climbs into their 1955 Chevy ( and , later , into their jeans ) . After some roadhouse blues ( taking Jim Morrison's " Moonlight Drive " ) , the young men encounter exhibitionist Warren Oates ( as G . T . O ) , who thinks Mr . Taylor's Chevy is harassing the bright new Pontiac he shows off to hitchhikers . Increasingly bored , Ms . Bird laments taking the back seat . Increasingly annoyed , Mr . Oats challenges what he calls the " two punk road hogs " to a race . Bird flies into Oats ' coupe ( temporarily ) . Taylor and Mr . Wilson make arrangements for a race with Oats . The winner takes all pink slips . Kris Kristofferson sings " Me and Bobby McGee " . Bird sings " ( I Can't Get No ) Satisfaction " . Taylor and Wilson sing nothing at all ; but , if they had , the film's spell would be broken . Monte Hellman's " Two-Lane Blacktop " is not an easy rider . Often , it seems like nothing is happening . But , the characters and situations blend into something very pure , and dependable . Laid-back Harry Dean Stanton's gay cowboy and trucker George Mitchell ( the first handyman on " Dark Shadows " ) , fit perfectly into the mix . The landscape is extraordinary . The story is minimalist . Criticism is pointless . It can be about anything . And , the road goes on forever . . .

452438	15896852	12486	9.0	Jackie Coogan Cleans Up	Five-year-old orphan Jackie Coogan ( as Jackie Blair , " The Boy " ) arrives at New York's Ellis Island ; his father was killed in France , and his mother passed away during the voyage . United States immigration officials want to take him back , but young Coogan thwarts fate by slipping through with a family of eight . With no place to go ( but with cuteness to spare ) , Coogan tags along with grumpy old man Claude Gillingwater ( as Bill Hicks , " The Captain " ) . Desperate for lodgings , Coogan seeks to make himself useful to crusty Gillingwater ; and , his growing fondness for the boy makes increasingly difficult for Gillingwater to throw Coogan out . Coogan's late 1921 follow-up to earlier-in-the-year hits " The Kid " and " Peck's Bad Boy " owes much to the former ( Charlie Chaplin ) film . Still , " My Boy " does rate very highly on its own . First of all , Coogan is , by now , obviously a remarkable young actor . Suspicions about the five-year-old's performances owing everything to " Kid's " Chaplin and " Peck's " Sam Wood are laid firmly to rest . Coogan proves himself , herein directed by Victor Heerman and Albert Austin , an actor to be reckoned with . Coogan's characterization is incredibly natural , under the circumstances . He steers clear of the tendency to become mawkishly cloying - - the road , unfortunately , taken by many a " child star " . At this point in his career , the credit must be given to Coogan's camp ( perhaps , the boy and his father ) . " My Boy " solidified Coogan as a box office super-star . Gillingwater and Mathilde Brundage ( as Mrs . J . Montague Blair , " The Grandmother " ) provide fine support . There are ( at least ) two absolutely indispensable film sequences to watch for , in " My Boy " : The first is when Coogan gives himself a bath and shower ; his performance is wonderful . The second is when Coogan runs away from a party , after being accused of stealing a lady's purse ; the resulting cinematic poetry might have left Chaplin feeling envious . Coogan dancing to an organ-grinder's beat is almost as indelible . " My Boy " features one of the most endearing child performers in one of his best roles .

The other life is lived in computers , where you go by the hacker alias ' Neo ' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for . One of these lives has a future , and one of them does not . " That's a good description . Everything changes for Mr .

452392	15896852	74708	9.0	The Little Prince and The Fox	Not the life story of James Dean , but the story of Mr . Dean and writer William Bast . This is , in fact , their ( partially veiled ) love story . Mr . Bast was Dean's " best friend " , " roommate " , and / or " confidant " for the last five years of his life . James Dean and William Bast . Were they " just good friends " for five years ? Not exactly . Bast wrote , and co-produced ; and Robert Butler directed . The production is surprisingly high quality , considering the fact that this was a 1976 " TV movie " . Frank Stanley's photography excels . It could have been a feature film . Perhaps , Bast preferred the guaranteed television audience , as a feature hinting at his sexual relationship with Dean would have been poorly received in most movie houses . Michael Brandon ( as Bast ) and Stephen McHattie ( as Dean ) are very convincing , as the young friends . It's sometimes a little difficult to determine if the " The Little Prince and The Fox " knew what they were playing with fire ; however , it seems obvious that director Butler had figured out Bast's direction . At first , it seems as if the duo's numerous lovely girlfriends are all Pier Angelis ( red herrings ) ; actually , they are realistic , and help explain the complicated Dean / Bast relationship . The female supporting cast is pretty ( and ) numerous ; Candy Clark ( as Christine White ) is one stand-out , believability-wise ; note , the real-life Ms . White appears in a small role . Watch out for a very tender " barroom " scene with Leland Palmer ( as Arlene ) , a disabled woman Dean takes for a ride . Reality sets you free . " James Dean " should have been nominated for several " Emmy " awards , especially considering the Brandon and McHattie lead performances , and the TV movie's relative production values . The film could be criticized for " holding back " ; but , it could also be praised for being able to make its points without being explicit . Emotionally , at least , " James Dean " is clear ; discerning what's left out isn't too difficult . James Dean ( / 76 ) William Bast - Michael Brandon , Stephen McHattie , Candy Clark , Leland Palmer
453644	15896852	57263	9.0	Natalie Wood Makes Good	This starts out being an extraordinary drama , and ends up being an excellent romantic comedy . Both are done well , although " Love with the Proper Stranger " might have been better off sticking to the dramatics . Natalie Wood ( as Angie Rossini ) and Steve McQueen ( as Rocky Papasano ) are an infectious team . As the film opens Ms . Wood is tracking Mr . McQueen down , to ask for help in obtaining an abortion . McQueen seems to have forgotten the dalliance with Wood ( blame it on the scotch ) . Watch for a brief moment when McQueen looks Wood up and down , in their first on-screen scene ; this is , perhaps , when McQueen recalls her , and the point at which he begins to " fall in love " with her character ( as the sexual attraction had already reached culmination ) . McQueen's realization is long and confused ; but , Wood visibly " falls in love " with McQueen while watching him interact with his parents . In this case , disposing with the initial sexual attraction has made the characters ' " romance " more interesting . This is difficult to play so convincingly ; and , the lead performances , along with the direction of Robert Mulligan , are award-worthy . The dramatic highlight will be obvious ; the comic highlight is the scene with Wood having dinner with Tom Bosley ( as Anthony Columbo ) ' s family . This scene works so well because it both parallels and contrasts Wood's earlier meeting with McQueen's family ( when she fell in love with him ) . Mr . Bosley heads up a strong supporting cast . Arnold Schulman's script , and the Milton R . Krasner photography , are also outstanding . The unworthy last act is disappointing , but not damning .

452954	15896852	44953	9.0	On Ryan's Express	Looking at the IMDb " Awards " link will reveal this outstanding Anthony Mann western was nominated for a single " Academy Award " , for the " Story and Screenplay " by Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom . The story ( and much about the film ) is excellent . Certainly , the writers deserved recognition for the intriguing story , and complex characters . But , to see " The Naked Spur " was NOT nominated for " Best Color Cinematography " is shocking . William Mellor's photography is truly superior . Perhaps , they felt one nomination was enough for a movie about greed . James Stewart ( as Howard Kemp ) , Janet Leigh ( as Lina Patch ) , Robert Ryan ( as Ben Vandergroat ) , Ralph Meeker ( as Roy Anderson ) , and Millard Mitchell ( as Jesse Tate ) are an outstanding Colorado quintet . With Mann and Mellor directing , the small cast appears sprawling . Of the five , Mr . Ryan's intensely malevolent " Ben " reigns supreme ; it's difficult to envision " The Naked Spur " without Ryan's psychological thorn throwing . Recipient Stewart is also at his best . The other three are great ; though , more should have been to done develop and / or explain the relationship . Leigh had / has with Ryan and Stewart ; she is underused . That , and a couple of continuity and / or editing problems may distract , slightly . We shouldn't be to be too greedy about great movies , after all .

453405	15896852	22854	9.0	Marie Dressler Is Beautiful	Hefty housekeeper Marie Dressler ( as Emma ) becomes the surrogate mother to a wealthy Long Island family , after their mother dies , giving birth to Richard Cromwell ( as Ronnie ) . While helping her prepare for a well-deserved Niagara Falls vacation , family father Jean Hersholt ( as Smith ) startles Ms . Dressler by proposing marriage ; and , the trip becomes a honeymoon . Back home , only Mr . Cromwell , Dressler's favorite " son " , celebrates the marriage . The three other Smith children ( George Meeker , Myrna Loy , and Barbara Kent ) are furious ; they feel the ailing Mr . Hersholt married a mere " servant " , who will steal the family fortune . This is Marie Dressler at her sentimental best ; assisted by an apt MGM team , including Clarence Brown ( director ) , Oliver Marsh ( photographer ) , and Frances Marion ( writer ) . Dressler won a " Best Actress " Academy Award " for a previous effort , " Min and Bill " ( 1930 ) ; however , her " Emma " is a stronger characterization . This more deserved " Best Actress " nomination became the Academy Awards ' # 2 choice for the eligibility period ; in the voting , Dressler was just behind winner Helen Hayes ( in " The Sin of Madelon Claudet " ) . Dressler should have won for " Emma " , rather than " Min and Bill " . Richard Cromwell and Jean Hersholt might have been nominated as " Best Supporting Actors " ; but , the category was not introduced until 1936 ( Dressler would have likely won the award , in this category , for " Anna Christie " ) . Parts of " Emma " have not aged well , especially some of the early , yet important , scenes . But , its strengths make up for these weaknesses . Watch for the scene in which Dressler throws her ungrateful step-children out of the house . This is followed by a scene with Dressler being " haunted " by the " ghosts " of the little Smith children ; it's an extraordinarily touching " special effect " . And , it all works so well due to Dressler . Dressler is unfairly called a " scene stealer " ; most of the time , she was just very good . If you were good , you kept up with her . With material to work with , Dressler's co-stars are just as memorable . Note , how , in lesser roles , Cromwell and Hersholt compliment Dressler's " Emma " perfectly . Both Hersholt and Dressler play his " death scene " beautifully . And , Cromwell's one-word description of " Emma " is the film's most lingering . You won't forget it . Emma ( 1932 ) Clarence Brown - Marie Dressler , Richard Cromwell , Jean Hersholt , Myrna Loy
453044	15896852	18528	9.0	Lon Chaney Gets Two Thumbs Up	Lon Chaney ( as Alonzo the Armless ) is a criminal posing as an armless circus knife-wielder ; he amazes by throwing knives with his feet , notably at assistant Joan Crawford ( as Nanon Zanzi ) . Actually , Mr . Chaney's arms are tightly girdled to his chest ; he suffers from an obvious deformity , which would identify him to authorities - - he has two thumbs on his left hand . Evidently a victim of sex abuse , Ms . Crawford has an unusual fear of arms ; so , she rejects the advances of circus strongman Norman Kerry ( as Malabar the Mighty ) . Instead , she warms up to the armless Chaney . He mistakes Crawford's affection for love , and decides to make himself her ideal , by amputating his arms ! While Chaney recuperates , Crawford overcomes her fear , and begins to enjoy Mr . Kerry's muscular arms . When he returns , Chaney is understandably upset ? Chaney and director Tod Browning are superb in this disturbing , horrific drama . Browning builds great suspense in the wonderful ending , wherein he winds up disturbing images in your mind , and teasingly leaves them on the verge of exploding - - as usual , the horror unseen is the most unsettling . Crawford excels in one of her best early roles ; she plays falling in love with Kerry exceptionally well . Of course , no one can match Chaney ; though great throughout , his scene realizing Crawford never truly loved him is emotionally wrenching . Great character actor John George ( as Cojo ) has a fine role as Chaney's helper - - the scene where he first unwraps the girdled " Alonzo " should have your eyes glued to the screen . There appear to be some portions of " The Unknown " missing , but the amputation of footage hasn't spoiled the film .

453345	15896852	29606	9.0	Sunrise , Sunset	Perky aspiring actress Janet Gaynor ( as Esther Blodgett ) leaves her small town for Hollywood ; instead of extra work , she finds work as a waitress . Ms . Gaynor breaks dishes ; imitates Greta Garbo , Katharine Hepburn , and Mae West ; and meets alcoholic actor Fredric March ( as Norman Maine ) . Mr . March likes Gaynor's sweetness and sincerity ; he arranges a screen test for her , and the two become romantically involved . Then , Gaynor becomes Hollywood's newest star sensation ( as " Vicki Lester " ) while March ( as " Mr . Lester " ) ' s star sets . David O . Selznick's version of " What Price Hollywood ? " ( among others ) is beautifully photographed ( W . Howard Greene ) and directed ( William A . Wellman ) ; especially noteworthy are the location scenes , with its near-final " sunset " providing an excellent thematic statement . Few of Gaynor's contemporaries could have played the early scenes with the same sincerity ( which parallels her character ) . She is terrific as the naïve young star ; most importantly , she is believable as a woman who steps from obscurity to stardom . March is perfect as the eclipsed movie idol ; it would have been nice to know more about his character's history of , and reason for , drinking ( amusement is a given reason ) . Lionel Stander ( as Matt Libby ) ' s portrayal of a prickly publicist stands out , among the supporting cast ( Adolphe Menjou , May Robson , and Andy Devine ) . This film was heralded as realistic depiction of " Hollywood " stardom ; and , there are cute , clever , and realistic details throughout . Nothing too extraordinary is revealed , however . The film barely scratches the surface ; and , it is curiously more asexual than previous cinematic trips down the walk of fame ( it was affected by the " Hays Code " , no doubt ) . Still , due to its strengths , this version of " A Star Is Born " compares most favorably with subsequent versions . A Star Is Born ( 1937 ) William A . Wellman - Janet Gaynor , Fredric March , Lionel Stander , Adolphe Menjou
452539	15896852	117665	9.0	Reckless Endangerment	The script explains " Sleepers " as , " the street name for anyone who spent time in a juvenile facility . " This portends young children are physically abused in " reform schools " , leading to permanent psychological problems throughout life . So , " Sleepers " are physically and sexually abused young children . Those afflicted , herein at the " Wilkinson Home for Boys " , are four childhood friends , from New York's " Hell's Kitchen " : Joe Perrino and Jason Patric ( as Lorenzo " Shakes " Carcaterra ) , Brad Renfro and Brad Pitt ( as Michael Sullivan ) , Jonathan Tucker and Billy Crudup ( as Thomas Marcano ) , and Geoffrey Wigdor and Ron Eldard ( as John Reilly ) . The eight actors are well-cast ; and , their work is extraordinary . Mr . Perrino essays , arguably , the octet's greatest performance ; the film is centered around his stinging , sensitive characterization . Unfortunately , the story unravels , during the second half of the film . A serious topic is bowdlerized by an increasingly implausible set of circumstances . Without giving anything away ( after all , this is still a great film ) , note that social worker Minnie Driver ( as Carol Martinez ) sums up the film's ideological shortcomings with the line , " What is this , a gay bar ? " The line , and the actors ' lack of traumatized reaction , helps separate being " gay " from the sadistic homosexual pedophile portrayed by Kevin Bacon ( as Sean Nokes ) . For the clearest delineation of the " Sean Nokes " character , note Mr . Bacon's eyes as he watches Perrino undress . The subtle " homophobia " , and " immoral " act committed by the killers ' Priest ( and " friend " ) Robert De Niro ( as Father Bobby ) , will unsettle many viewers . Still , director Barry Levinson , and novelist Lorenzo Carcaterra , should be commended for shining light on topics too often regulated to the dark . The single " Academy Award " nomination , for John Williams ' always excellent music , is shocking . The film contains at least five performances worthy of a " Best Supporting Actor " Oscar ; perhaps , with so many in contention , it was easier to simply move on . In addition to those mentioned above , you have alcoholic lawyer Dustin Hoffman ( as Danny Snyder ) , kindly mobster Vittorio Gassman ( as King Benny ) , and Terry Kinney ( as Ralph Ferguson ) . Mr . Kinney's witness stand meltdown is most amazing . Stu Linder's editing , Timothy Galvin's art direction , and Beth Rubino's set direction are also award worthy . It's hard to believe five films topped the Gavin / Rubino work on " Sleepers " . Set in the late 1960s , the first part of " Sleepers " ( forgiving the fact that the lads would not have been listening to Donovan's " Hurdy Gurdy Man " in 1967 ) is a fantastic film : Sleepers ( 1996 ) Barry Levinson - Joseph Perrino , Brad Renfro , Jonathan Tucker , Geoffrey Wigdor Set in the early 1980s , the second part falters in storyline ; but , it's still an excellent movie : Sleepers ( 1996 ) Barry Levinson - Jason Patric , Brad Pitt , Robert De Niro , Dustin HoffmanAveraging out to a still well above average : Sleepers ( 1996 ) Barry Levinson - Joseph Perrino , Jason Patric , Kevin Bacon , Brad Pitt
453082	15896852	20768	9.0	Silence Is Golden for F . W . Murnau and Charles Farrell	Minnesota country boy Charles Farrell ( as Lem ) goes to Chicago , to sell the family's wheat harvest . In the hectic city , he meets pretty coffee shop waitress Mary Duncan ( as Kate ) , who longs for the simple life . The attractive pair fall blissfully in love . After marrying Ms . Duncan , Mr . Farrell takes her home to live with his country family . But , father David Torrence ( as Tustine ) distrusts the " City Girl " , and is angry with his son for selling his wheat at an inferior price . A stern patriarch , Mr . Torrence drives a wedge between the happy couple . To make matters worse , Duncan becomes prey for some arriving reapers ? This is another stunner from director F . W . Murnau ( " Sunrise " ) , who would so tragically die in a car accident ( after only one more film ) . " City Girl " was produced by Mr . Murnau as a " silent " ( " Our Daily Bread " ) ; but , Fox Films recalled the movie , and turned it into a " talkie " . At the time , Farrell's name was rising to the upper reaches of " Box Office " star lists , but , truth be told , only Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo still had the power to draw audiences to a silent movie ( and , even that was fading ) . With re-shoots , a partially talking " City Girl " was seen briefly , and forgotten . The unearthed full length silent version was , thankfully , preserved . It is a near-perfect film . Farrell , who many felt deserves some " Best Actor " recognition fro his role in " 7th Heaven " , outdoes himself . Murnau , photographer Ernest Palmer , set director Harry Oliver are also award-worthy . Although she looks too startlingly glamorous in the country portions , Duncan is hot in the city . No wonder leering Richard Alexander ( as Mac ) couldn't keep his hands off her . The entire cast performs splendidly , right down to David Rollins giving Duncan lift at work . Sequences to re-play ( if not the whole movie ) : Farrell walking the crowded city streets , Duncan in her apartment ( where she blows the city dust off her suffocating plant ) , the couple's ecstatic run through his father's wheat fields , the arrival of grinning Guinn Williams and the reapers , and their harvesting scenes . Murnau's direction of the horse-driven wagons is especially spectacular . The lighting is brilliant throughout . City Girl ( / 30 ) F . W .

The researchers decide to travel forward in time to find the cause of the horrible accident that apparently will ruin the ecology and threaten the very existence of man , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Actually , the research scientists send young people to the future , to study the discovered ecological crisis ; and , the young men and women contemplate starting a futuristic civilization there . Watch for the lead actress Kelly Bohanan ( as Karen ) visit the dentist early in the running time ; she emerges as the film's main character . Without her metallic dental braces , Ms . Bohanan is able to join sister Caroline Hildebrand ( as Isa ) in time traveling exploration . Ms . Hildebrand and sister Bohanan nonchalantly take off their pants for the camera ; because , anything with metal ( like zippers or buttons ) must be put in the " Material Projection Department " for time travel . The women are very attractive , but nothing is gratuitous . The first scene with Hildebrand explains the rules of time travel to Bohanan is where the film first grabs you . It is absolutely ludicrous : two hippie-type women explaining time trip rules , in their underwear ; but , it is also absolutely believable . " Idaho Transfer " succeeds , at this " guidelines for travel " moment , because you are ( or should be ) putting your trust in the young travelers . It's obviously going to be a very unusual movie . Most of the characters ' dialogue helps explain events ; still , it's not always clear what is happening , or where . And , yet , the movie is never dishonest . Director Peter Fonda and writer Thomas Matthiesen create a very captivating , thought-provoking world , with its own rules . Mr . Fonda should consider directing more often ; and , with the so often neglected type of performances from this cast . Kevin Hearst ( as Ronald ) emerges as Bohanan's " leading man " ; and , Keith Carradine is most notable among the other players . Although Fonda undoubtedly guided them , it's surprising so few in the cast achieved later fame , especially Bohanan . The character " Karen " is where you will find the real story ; it's in her almost constant longing for a child . Bohanan's face , and Fonda's camera , capture the desire frequently . And , of course , it is not an easy prospect . " Ronald " may be homosexual and / or asexual , along with others . Although it is discussed , you won't see sex . The desire for children symbolizes hope for the future , which may not be likely , in this world . Instead , industry eats up , and ruins things , like the derelict car " Karen " and " Ronald " find . And , literally , the train Mr . Hearst discovers has " eaten " its skeletal passengers . The ending is a perfect culmination of events . The ecological and environmental issues addressed in " Idaho Transfer " were certainly ahead of the curve .

Under the guidance of trainer Rudd Weatherwax , the dog will become one of the most popular and enduring animal " stars " ever . It's easy to see why , in " Lassie Come Home " . The collie , and its descendants , performed this basic role for some decades to come . When the story begins , Lassie must be sold , by the poor Carracloughs : father Donald Crisp , mother Elsa Lancaster , and their boy Roddy McDowall . Mr . Crisp loses his job , and can't afford to keep the pet . Though Lassie is sold , his real emotional " owner " is the boy Joe , played by Mr . McDowall . McDowall's performance is great , and the others are no less than competent . The MGM color cinematography is gorgeous , and the story understandably sentimental . Interestingly , Elizabeth Taylor appears in her second film role ; she will become Lassie's owner for the third series film , " Courage of Lassie " ( 1946 ) . If " Lassie , Come Home " doesn't raise some emotion in you , may not be human . Lassie Come Home ( 1943 ) Fred M . Wilcox - Roddy McDowall , Donald Crisp , Elizabeth Taylor , May Witty

After knocking off some competition , Mr . Chaney puts opera star Philbin in a hypnotic state , and takes her to his underground domain ( five cellars down ) ; there , Philbin comes to her senses , and seems terrified . Chaney professes his undying love , but Philbin wants none of it ; she is engaged to Norman Kerry ( as Raoul ) . " The Phantom of the Opera " does not start off very well - - there are some dance sequences , followed by a man with a disembodied head , who pops through floors . Events do not seem to be fully explained . Mainly , try to accept the hypnotic " hold " Chaney has over Philbin , and stick with the story as he takes her down to his underground chambers . " Feast your eyes - - glut your soul , on my accursed ugliness ! " The scene where Chaney's Phantom gets unmasked is extraordinary . Then , the " Bal Masque de l'Opera " occurs , in early color ; it looks very good , and Chaney attends . Watch for the fallen chandelier to appear amazingly repaired , and reattached , for a later Philbin solo ! The scenes with Chaney are worth waiting for ; the ending exciting , and the sets magnificent .

His girlfriend Gloria Swanson ( as Gloria Dawn ) lives down the hall with her dog Teddy ( a Great Dane ) . Ms . Swanson's guardian is rascally Wallace Berry ( as Henry Black ) ; he is also in charge of Mr . Vernon's estate , which he is stealing from . In order to protect , and enhance , his stolen wealth , Mr . Berry plots with buxom sister May Emory - - the two agree Ms . Emory will lure the unsuspecting Vernon into marriage . Vernon excels in this film ; particularly , watch his performance when proposing to Emory - - his expressions , and word-perfect reading , make him easily understood . It's a great scene . Vernon's dance at the hotel ( again , with Emory ) is another highlight . Swanson and Berry ( who married in real life ) are terrific , as well . The production is first rate , including a beautifully photographed storm , and an exciting comic climax . Hang on as Vernon and Teddy take a bicycle to rescue Swanson from an approaching train !

When the suspicious officer asks to see some identification , Mr . Basehart shows him the barrel his gun . Soon , cop-killer Basehart is being perused by Scott Brady ( as Marty Brennan ) and the Los Angeles Police Department . Basehart proves himself to be a quite resourceful ; notably ; he uses the city's sewers as an escape route ? With masterful use of light and shadows , from cinematographer John Alton , " He Walked by Night " is one of the most visually striking films of the 1940s . Basehart's psychotic star performance is also award-worthy ; especially , after witnessing his character operate on himself , in close-up , to remove a bullet . The supporting cast is a treasure trove , among them : Roy Roberts as the determined police captain , Dorothy Adams as the loony lady on Brady's milk run , Whit Bissell as Basehart's bookish friend , Billy Mauch as the mugging head of a teen gang , and Jack Webb learning how to make " Dragnet " a west coast version of " The Naked City " . And , that's not all ; read the extended cast list on IMDb before watching , so you don't miss anyone !
453000	15896852	12190	9.0	Last Tango in Paris	Europe is " a world old in hatred and bloodshed , where nation is crowded against nation and creed against creed , centuries of war have sown their bitter seed , and the fires of resentment smoldering beneath the crust of civilization but await the breaking of the Seven Seals of Prophecy to start a mighty conflagration . " But , in the Americas , " boundless space offers a haven to the alien , and ancient hatreds are forgotten . " In the " New World " , Pomeroy Cannon ( as Madariaga ) and his family thrive . Mr . Cannon's eldest daughter Bridgetta Clark ( as Luisa ) marries German Alan Hale ( as Karl von Hartrott ) , and they have three sons . Youngest daughter Mabel Van Buren ( as Elena ) marries French Josef Swickard ( as Marcelo Desnoyers ) , and they sire son Rudolph Valentino ( as Julio Desnoyers ) and daughter Virginia Warwick ( as Chichi ) . From the preceding family of characters , you should pay relatively close attention to Mr . Valentino's " Julio " and Mr . Swickard's " Desnoyers " , who emerge as two of the drama's three leading players ; they are patriarch Cannon's favorite grandson and son , respectively . When the old man dies , the sisters ' families move back to their husbands ' home countries of Germany and France . Valentino studies art , thrills the French with his " Argentine Tango " , and begins an affair with married woman Alice Terry ( as Marguerite Laurier ) . Ms . Terry , wife of director Rex Ingram , is the third player of prominence . Several supporting players stand out ; perhaps none more than two men Valentino becomes acquainted with , in France : servile companion Bowditch M . Turner ( as Argensola ) and mysterious " man upstairs " ( hint , hint ! ) Nigel de Brulier ( as Tchernoff ) . Eventually , events culminate into " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse " fulfilling its promise ; it becomes a story of The Great War ( aka World War I ) . Ibáñez ( and adapter June Mathis ) ' " Four Horsemen " are : Conquest , War , Pestilence , and Death . The war scenes are exciting . In a great crosscutting sequence , Valentino throws Mr . Turner out of the apartment , so he can " entertain " Terry . Due to a downpour , Turner goes upstairs to visit with mysterious Mr . de Brulier , who cuts into the forbidden fruit of an apple , while Valentino ( off screen ) similarly removes Terry's " beautiful covering " and " cloak of virtue . " No sexual relations are shown , but director Ingram clearly makes his point . And , all of this occurs as the Great War erupts . The film's overall thesis is unsteady , at times ; and , there are little things ( like animals ) to distract - - does nurse Terry's husband fail to recognize her voice ? Award-worthy Valentino and Terry speak French in France , by the way - - regardé , for example , " Oui " for " Yes " . " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse " is a triumph for Mr . Ingram , photographer John F . Seitzand , and company . Despite some flaws , it's an indispensable film .

452805	15896852	49096	9.0	Flagon with a Dragon	" The Court Jester " is an obvious film - - it's witty , colorful , and adventurous . It not only works as fine example of the Medieval era film , but is also a spoof of the genre . Norman Panama and Melvin Frank wrote , produced , and directed ; with brilliant style , and cohesiveness . Danny Kaye fits the title role like a glove ; and , additional archetypal characterizations are highlighted by Basil Rathbone ( as Sir Ravenhurst ) and Mildred Natwick ( as Griselda ) . The latter provides Mr . Kaye with the unforgettable advice , " The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the dragon ; the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true . " Just remember that .
453656	15896852	64285	9.0	A Victory for Truffaut	An absolutely enthralling film , based on the true story of a real-life boy " Tarzan " . Discovered in a French Aveyron forest , in the late 1700s , " The Wild Child " was considered to be a deaf and dumb savage . But , young doctor Jean Itard ( played by director Francois Truffaut ) believes he can " civilize " the child . With tentative permission from the child's guardian " Institute for the Deaf and Dumb " , Dr . Itard takes the savage boy into his home . Itard becomes the child's teacher and , ultimately , surrogate parent . Housekeeper Françoise Seigner adds some expert motherly affection . Itard symbolically names the boy " Victor " due to his preference for the ending " O " sound . Director / writer / co-star Truffaut's " L ' Infant sauvage " is a minor masterpiece . It's beautifully photographed ( by Nestor Almendros ) , thought-provoking , and emotionally captivating . The ending events are , in fact , an emotional roller-coaster . Truffaut elicits a tremendous performance from Jean-Pierre Cargol as the savage young Victor . A great film for parents , teachers , and children ( which means , of course , everyone ) .

452891	15896852	62376	9.0	Sidney Poitier's Defining Role	Sidney Poitier ( as Mark Thackeray ) wants to be an engineer , but finds jobs scarce ; so , he takes a job teaching a group of unmanageable East End London secondary ( high ) school students . The inexperienced Mr . Poitier has no control in the classroom . With only a few weeks before graduation , he decides to teach discipline and respect . Poitier's biggest classroom problem is rebellious youth Christian Roberts ( as Denham ) . He also has to deal with pretty blonde Judy Geeson ( as Pamela ) , who develops a " schoolgirl crush " on her handsome black teacher . Poitier doesn't seem to be doing much academic teaching ; but , with only a few weeks to go , he makes some instinctive , wise decisions . As the students ' " newest replacement " , he must start with extensive classroom management . Mostly , the students like to dance and smoke cigarettes . But , through the young cast's performances , and their scripted background , you believe they are worse than they appear on film . The film is a simplistic representation . Poitier's dignified characterization is superb . As " Mr . Thackeray " , he handles societal racism with quiet reservation . Thackeray does not verbalize any racial " blame " for his 18-month failure to find an engineering job . He grins sweetly when the ladies on the bus hint about his sexual prowess . He does not respond to the cynical teacher's bait . And , he responds with non-sensual sincerity to the film's interested blondes . More than anything , Thackeray values courtesy , which is evidenced by his first " tantrum " . Thatcher is a man of polite manners , who values respect . He demands the students call him " Sir " . Poitier's command for respect works not only with the students , but also with the audience . Poitier cuts through the film , and demands the same respect from the audience . You call him SIR ! So , the " lesson " achieves the unexpected - - both Thackeray and Poitier are successful with their audience . The audience responded by making Poitier a " Box Office " superstar . It was the right message , the right time , and the right man . Director James Clavell and the Lulu-sung title song are also outstanding . Most movie award organizations favored Poitier's two successive 1967 films . But , " To Sir , with Love " did very well with the " Film Daily " critics : " To Sir , with Love " was the year's # 4 Film , and # 1 song . Poitier was the # 3 " Best Actor " ( one better than his " In the Heat of the Night " role ) , Christian Roberts was " Juvenile Actor " # 2 , and Judy Geeson won as # 1 " Juvenile Actress " .

453108	15896852	94336	9.0	Mr . Robinson , Are You Trying to Seduce Me ?	Possibly , this is a story about moving on from a friendship , potentially sexual , which is going nowhere , due to the inability of one of the friends to overcome addiction , and function in an unwelcome world . So , " Withnail & I " is a little too vague its dramatic intentions ; but , the obliqueness does wind up mirroring Withnail's character . It gives the film a ( perhaps unintentional ) eerie quality ; it's as difficult to completely grasp what's going on beneath the surface as it is for " Withnail & I " to figure out how to exist in reality . The " Hamlet " ending is great ; but , before that , some final sequences seem abrupt . Parting is such sweet sorrow . The film's comedic worth is considerable ; it's extremely witty . Bleary-eyed Richard E . Grant ( as " Withnail " ) and bright-eyed Paul McGann ( as " I " ) create exceptional , memorable characterizations . Richard Griffiths ( as " Monty " ) manages to play the " gay joke " without becoming too offensive ; saved , again , by an exceptional script . Ironically , director / writer Bruce Robinson delivers to die for roles to two actors playing desperately unemployed actors . Mr . Robinson's script is superb - - and ; it's one reason you should plan to watch this film twice . Withnail & I ( 1987 ) Bruce Robinson - Richard E .

452484	15896852	55718	9.0	You Must Visit " 13 West Street "	I was very surprised with " 13 West Street " . I found it both believable , and well-performed . It's amazing to see Alan Ladd's character correctly identify his as a " hate " crime . The way the director makes us ( and the characters ) think all teenagers are members of the five who attacked Mr . Ladd was nicely done . The successful older man coming to terms , perhaps , with his increasing vulnerability is a great film subject . Ladd seems to understand this , and it becomes part of his performance . His physicality ( whatever real health concerns he is having ) is successfully incorporated into his performance . Ladd's younger " trophy " wife really cares for him , and is unsure how to handle the unfolding events . Rod Steiger is great as the police detective assigned to the case - - watch how he turns over the newspaper when he confront the bartender . There are a lot of nice little touches like that - - from the director and / or performers ? watch all their little mannerisms ; they all fit the characters , and add to the believability . There are more unexpected , and riveting , events . Are they implausible ? In a 1962 film , perhaps they seemed so , but the decade ended with crimes and criminals significantly more " implausible " . Accepting the situation is believable , there are some flaws which keep this from being a perfect film . I would have preferred " Chuck " to be a Charles Manson-type psycho , and could have done without the " Teenage Terror " angle . There are also some necessary " budget " restrictions . They made the absolute most out of the budget they had , though . Highly recommended ! 13 West Street ( 1962 ) Philip Leacock - Alan Ladd , Rod Steiger , Michael Callan , Dolores Dorn

Peter Lawford is around to make the threesome a foursome , when necessary . Believe it or not , Ms . Garland turns out to be a great star , and becomes romantically interested in her mentor . . . This is really a collection of instant classics , strung together in a silly story . However , the performances are so indispensable , the story hardly matters . Among the terrific : " Drum Crazy " , " Shakin ' the Blues Away " , " Steppin ' Out with My Baby " , " A Couple of Swells " , and " Easter Parade " . That's entertainment .

452947	15896852	94315	9.0	Swan Songs	Patient , kind Lillian Gish ( as Sarah Webber ) and contrary , cantankerous Bette Davis ( as Libby Strong ) are two aging sisters ; who spend what is likely to be their last summer together , arguing about their limited future . Ms . Gish wants to have a " picture window " built for the house ; but , the blind Ms . Davis thinks not . Gish awaits the annual appearance of " The Whales of August " , and Davis reminisces , instead , about " The Swans " . Nothing overtly extraordinary happens . There are no picture windows , whales , or swans . Beneath the surface , Gish is a romantic dreamer , and Davis is sad and wise . These qualities , and the sisters ' love for each other , are demonstrated by the actress ' remarkably delicate performances , David Berry's subtle script , and Lindsay Anderson's steady direction . Vincent Price , Ann Sothern , and Harry Carey Jr . are a great supporting cast . Gish's name was a curious omission from the " Academy Award " list of nominations ; the " National Board " hedged its bets with a special lifetime achievement award ; but , Gish won their " Best Actress " award anyway . Davis ' performance was also award worthy . You may ache for the film to be technically better , or more " dramatic " ; but , you will never again see the constellation of stars within .

453678	15896852	10193	9.0	Robert Harron's Last Hurrah	In the valley of Silver Waters , a peddler family has parked their wagon . " Little Nellie " ventures out into the woods , and unexpectedly witnesses a horrific crime - Martin Cain and his wife ( George Nichols and Josephine Crowell ) are raging against a poor immigrant woman they have obviously employed ; and , they inadvertently kill the woman . The violent act becomes a repressed memory for little Nellie . Ten years later , Lillian Gish ( as the grown up Nellie Jarvis ) is , once again , traveling through Silver Waters , with her ailing , widowed mother . After her mother dies ( " A life flowing out to mysterious uncharted seas . " ) , Ms . Gish meets Robert Harron ( as Jimmie Hilton ) , who lives nearby , with his poverty-stricken family . Mr . Harron's family helps Gish bury her mother ; and , with nowhere to go , she accepts their invitation to stay ? Harron is attracted to Gish ; and , they become inseparable . Harron's father George Fawcett ( as Robert Hilton ) is unable to work , due to disability . Precognizant mother Eugenie Besserer ( as Mrs . Hilton ) sees her favorite son Ralph Graves ( as John Hilton ) off to war , believing she will never see him again . To help out her financially strapped surrogate family , Gish seeks employment with Mr . and Mrs . Cain ; the memory of their evil deed is still repressed . Harron kisses Gish goodbye ; then , she moves in with the wicked Cains ? " The Greatest Question " is most notable as Robert Harron's last film ; he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on September 5 , 1920 . When Harron died ( " A life flowing out to mysterious uncharted seas . " ) , this film was still being widely exhibited . And , it's a representative role - the " boy next door " he played so well for director D . W . Griffith . Harron is charming and natural , in the role of Jimmie Hilton . His reflective look at Gish's departure , from behind his fence , is just what Gish was longing for in " True Heart Susie " ( 1919 ) . Robert Harron was one of the finest actor of his time ; his record of performances , and acting style , portended a great career in the coming decades . In hindsight , he looks like one of the few silent performers certain to make a natural transition to sound film performances . At the time of his death , Harron had signed with Metro , where he worked on an unavailable film . There seems to be some controversy about whether or not Harron committed suicide ; if so , it could not have been due to an ongoing rivalry with actor Richard Barthelmess , over roles offered by director D . W . Griffith . By the time Harron died , both actors had left Griffith's company ; and , they remained friendly enough to attend the New York première of " Way Down East " ( 1920 ) . Ironically , " The Greatest Question " is about death ; and , Harron had a relatively unknown friend in New York , at that time , to attend the same " Way Down East " premiere - the soon famous , and also short-lived , Rudolph Valentino .

Dodsworth at Odds	Walter Huston ( as Sam Dodsworth ) and Ruth Chatterton ( as his wife , Fran ) are beginning their wedded " golden years " by taking a trip to Europe , as their daughter begins her own marriage . It's fairly obvious , early on , that Mr . Dodsworth loves Mrs . Dodsworth ; and , probably , he feels the European trip will enable the married couple to renew their relationship - - and grow closer , before growing old , together . It is also very clear , early on , that Mrs . Dodsworth is not " on board " ; in fact , her behavior is startlingly selfish and destructive . Mr . Huston and Ms . Chatterton perform very well as the Dodsworths . " Dodsworth " is a film to watch for performances , and they are very effective . Their characterizations are full enough for viewers to get an ever clearer picture of the Dodsworth marriage , as the film progresses . Chatterton , of course , participates in the unraveling , while Huston works for preserving of their marriage . Fran Dodsworth is a complicated part ; and , it is certainly a most unflattering choice of role for an actress in the 1930s - - this is probably a courageous role for Ruth Chatterton to accept , for the time . Of the supporting players , Mary Astor stands out as Mr . Huston's potential " other woman " - - the scene where Chatterton and Ms . Astor meet should not be missed ; watch the two actress ' faces and listen to the tone of their voices , for an extremely well-acted scene . William Wyler expertly directed the drama .

Unfazed by this experience , the woman heads off across country to her new job as a church organist . Experiencing strange things along her trip and also when she arrives at her new home , the woman begins to suspect the accident was not as it appears , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Actually , Candace Hilligoss ( as Mary Henry ) appears unwashed , and somewhat slightly dazed , after the accident . Ms . Hilligoss is imaginatively guided through the atmospherically startling , but never gruesomely horrifying , " Carnival of Souls " . Herk Harvey's film is a lesson in minimalist poetry . The director and photographer Maurice Prather give each scene a stark , simple beauty . Hilligoss ' first visit to the ghostly pavilion cements the film as divine ; it's one gorgeous shot after another . Some of the supporting players hit a sour note , but sleazy Sidney Berger ( as Mr . Linden ) , and director Harvey ( as Ghoul # 1 ) are just right . A miraculously moody piece .
453438	15896852	5955	9.0	Once Upon a Midnight Dreary	Henry B . Walthall was , by 1915 , one of the most celebrated actors on the motion picture screen ; when " The Raven " was released , his stock was very high ; and , watching his performance as Edgar Allen Poe illustrates why . Working with Director Charles Brabin , Mr . Walthall literally becomes Poe . In the actor's introduction , a portrait of Poe is replaced a with a close-up of Walthall's characterization . From then on , you believe the actor is Edgar Allen Poe ; judging from Poe's well-known images , there is a convenient resemblance , as well . I may always think of Poe as Walthall . Warda Howard co-stars as the women in Poe's life : Virginia Clemm , Helen Whitman , and their fantasized poetic counterpart ( s ) . Filmmakers decided Ms . Howard would play each of Poe's female interests ; and , it was a wise artistic decision . Howard handles the difficult assignment well ; I especially enjoyed her marvelous expressions as Walthall and his rotund chum Harry Dunkinson ( as Tony ) vie for her affection . On with the motley - - this is a biography of Poe . Considering the usual sanitization of the genre , and the era released ; it's exceptionally well done . Poe is characterized as a romantic writer , with a fondness for drink - - who would have guessed ? The story events seem digested , but accurate . The Poem is referenced , and the ending foreshadowed , with several images during the movie ; a favorite , the caged bird , in background , by a window . Brabin's use of several delirious superimposed visions are disturbingly well done , and effectively compliment the story . The highlight is the ending , when Mr . Walthall acts out Poe's expiration , while a reading of " The Raven " takes place on the title cards . Don't miss the bird ! Walthall had just been seen in the Poe-inspired " The Avenging Conscience " ( 1914 ) , the nightmarish " Ghosts " ( 1915 ) , and the epic " Birth of a Nation " . His Poe credentials stretched way back to Griffith's " The Sealed Room " ( 1909 ) . If Best Actor awards were given in 1915 , Walthall would certainly have one . He is terrific - - and , " The Raven " is a biography like no other . The Raven ( 1915 ) Charles Brabin - Henry B . Walthall , Warda Howard , Harry Dunkinson , Ernest Maupain

Would you take this case ? I can't say more ! It's difficult to say something ( or , something new ) about a film so great since it has not been seen by every reader here . . . I think it's interesting to consider : each of the characters NEEDS something . . . watch them , as they watch each other , evaluate these needs . Their needs are often selfish .

But something's different about the spirited boxing hopeful who shows up daily at Dunn's gym . All she wants is a fighting chance . Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs , produces and composes music for this acclaimed , multi-award-winning tale of heart , hope and family . Hilary Swank plays resilient Maggie , determined not to abandon her one dream . And Morgan Freeman is Scrap , gym caretaker and counterpoint to Dunn's crustiness . Grab your dreams and come out swinging . ' Million Dollar Baby ' is an absolute knockout . " Clint Eastwood Hits the Nail on the Head . I expected this film to be a " feminist " version of the traditional male-dominated " boxing movie " . It opens with a realistic depiction of the kind of physical damage boxing causes - so , I thought , are they going to show Q-Tips being shoved into the bloody , slit open face of movie star Hillary Swank ? I thought not ? Although Ms . Swank does not suffer a wound like the one in the introduction , " Million Dollar Baby " does not skirt this issue . The film is as realistic as they come . Swank is amazing , absolutely earning her many " Best Actress " honors . " She grew up knowing one thing , she was trash . " Auteur Eastwood is even more incredible - as producer , director , star , and composer . He uses his years of film-making experience wisely , and does not let one role interfere with another . The goal of a superior film is achieved , with generosity rather than egotism in evidence . " Million Dollar Baby " is , also , the crowning achievement of the " Eastwood style " . The lighting is exquisite . The film is quiet when it should be quiet , and noisy when it should be NOISY . The harder-to-manage " quietness " is expertly handled . The film is beautiful without being loud - it's starkly beautiful . Eastwood allows his audience to become a part of this movie . Morgan Freeman gives one of filmdom's all-time " Best Supporting Actor " performances . His character's narration gives the film poetry . Narration is one of the easiest techniques to administer , but one of the hardest to muster convincingly ; Mr . Freeman's is most convincing . And , Freeman's more subtle counterpoint story - his relationship with slow-witted Jay Baruchel ( as Danger " Flip " Barch ) - gives the film hope . Mr . Baruchel might have won a " Best Supporting the Best Supporting Actor " award ( as of this writing , not introduced ) . " Boxing is about respect - getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy . " " Million Dollar Baby " is about loving , non-sexual and non-familial relationships ( count the number of sexually involved " couples " in this film ) , and how very important these relationships are to our lives , and dreams . " Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye , " Eastwood echoes Lloyd Price , " Just because you left and said goodbye , do you think that I will sit and cry ? Even if my heart should tell me so , darling I would rather let you go . . . " Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) Clint Eastwood - Clint Eastwood , Hilary Swank , Morgan Freeman , Jay Baruchel
453041	15896852	246578	10.0	The Sky Is Falling ! The Sky Is Falling ! ( Don't Go in the Basement , Donnie ? )	This is " an edgy , psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny , " according to the promotional verbiage for the film , starring Jake Gyllenhaal as " a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future . " This description hardly scratches the surface of " Donnie Darko " . While watching the film , to enjoy a quirky , satisfying thriller , you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful . You are . Repeated viewings ( recommended ) will reveal completely different films . Writer / director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster . " Donnie Darko " is an multi-layered , inspirational , and beautifully produced work . Most obviously , it is superbly written and directed . Mr . Kelly , who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat , should have received an " Academy Award " , along with several members of his crew ; perhaps , the film's more " independent " status was an obstacle . The cast is exceptional , from Mr . Gyllenhaal's central role , to the many supporting characterizations , right down to the smallest players . This film is full of memorable characters , arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons , and for various lengths of time , to serve a defined purpose . They're all jewels . The film is set in Middlesex , Suburbia , during 1988 . Forget April , for the Darko family , October is the cruelest month . Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school , for burning down a house . Presently , Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker , who is not taking his medication ; perhaps , intuitively , he knows it wouldn't make any difference . Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell ( as Rose Darko ) , father Holmes Osborne ( as Eddie Darko ) , big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal ( as Elizabeth Darko ) , and little sister Daveigh Chase ( as Samantha Darko ) . They're all jewels . As with the entire cast , it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance . Gyllenhaal never disappoints . Secondarily , Ms . McDonnell's may be the best , due to Kelly's skillful writing . Motherly love , for a son who seems to be drifting into madness , is wondrous ; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility . Even Ms . Chase , who you'd expect to be the minor Darko , is magical ; she even writes about " The Last Unicorn " , Ariel ( before he died in the possession of Count Petofi ) . The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important . Many of them are teachers . At school , Drew Barrymore ( as Karen Pomeroy ) covers English literature in spectacular fashion ; she challenges students ' critical thinking skills , and gives Gyllenhaal guidance . As one of the film's producers , Ms . Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge . Beth Grant ( as Kitty Farmer ) displays a limitless ability to multitask . Noah Wyle ( as Kenneth Monnitoff ) lurks in the science department , and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time . Moreover , he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland ( as " Grandma Death " aka Roberta Sparrow ) , who whispers : " Every living creature on Earth dies alone . " Among the students , new girl in school Jena Malone ( as Gretchen Ross ) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest ; and , with a dark past of her own , she's a natural . Katharine Ross ( as Lilian Thurman ) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist . Patrick Swayze ( as Jim Cunningham ) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus , " Controlling Fear " . Even small parts shine , like Jolene Purdy ( as Cherita Chen ) . And , imaginary friend James Duval ( as Frank ) belongs in a very special class ( note , he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling " Harvey " ) . Finally , the soundtrack , including original music by Michael Andrews , has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture . From " The Killing Moon " ( by Echo and the Bunnymen ) to the new " Mad World " ( by Gary Jules ) , the mood is always finely tuned . Look up . Plane to catch . My time's out of space .

The film begins with a series of seemingly silly , sentimental , and hopelessly old-fashioned observations about the relationships between men and women like " True Heart Susie " and " William Roberts " . Director D . W . Griffith astutely notes , " Of course they don't know what poor simple idiots they are - - and , we , who have never been so foolish , an hardly hope to understand ? " You can tell , early on , that minister-to-be Harron is not really interested , romantically , in Gish . Harron prefers the " kind " of woman later idealized by Clarine Seymour ( as Bettina ) . Ms . Seymour leads a fine supporting cast , as the painted and partying " other woman " . Gish tries " power and stockings " , but it is not in her character . When she accidentally chances upon Harron and Seymour kissing , Gish realizes circumstances are beyond her control , and Harron is lost to her - - this is followed by an incredible close-up of Gish , which defies description . With " True Heart Susie " , director Griffith and company achieve " non-epic " perfection . In its own way , the film is as " epic " as the director's " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . Ms . Gish and Mr . Harron are superb , as usual ; though they are young adults , they are thoroughly convincing as opening-scene schoolchildren . The performances are almost outerworldly ; especially , after Harron expresses discontent , and Gish reacts . Gish's reactions are particularly amazing ; in fact , this may be her most supreme silent-era achievement , besting her own performance in the recently released " Broken Blossoms " ( 1919 ) . If " Best Actress " awards were given out in 1919 , Lillian Gish's " True Heart Susie " might have won over her own lead performance in " Broken Blossoms " . Truly classic .

453028	15896852	17416	10.0	Way to Go , Rudy	In sands " Not East of Suez - - but South of Algiers , " handsome Rudolph Valentino ( as Ahmed ) and beautiful dancing girl Vilma Bánky ( as Yasmin ) fall in love . Mr . Valentino learns that Ms . Bánky must dances for coins , which her wicked father George Fawcett ( as André ) gambles away . Mr . Fawcett and Montagu Love ( as Ghabah ) are part of a band of renegade thieves . Valentino wants Bánky for his own , but Fawcett isn't about to part with the goose that brings in the golden coins . Valentino is kidnapped , strung up , whipped , and held for ransom . Turns out , he's " The Son of the Sheik " ? Valentino is freed , with a lot of help from his friend Karl Dane ( as Ramadan ) . Valentino thinks Bánky betrayed their love ; and , he vengefully abducts her . Meanwhile , Ahmed's father Rudolph Valentino ( in a dual role , as the original Sheik ) and mother Agnes Ayres ( as Diana ) are preparing an arranged wedding for the younger Valentino . Father and son clash , over love and lust ? An indelible , essential film , " Son of the Sheik " finds Valentino at the top of his profession . George Fitzmaurice ( direction ) , George Barnes ( photography ) , William Cameron Menzies ( sets ) , and George Marion Jr . ( title cards ) are all outstanding . Bánky and the supporting cast are excellent . The filmmakers create a rich , dreamy , and imaginary world ; note how the opening " title card " refuses to be precise . This goes even further than the original " The Sheik " ( 1921 ) in establishing the films as something incompatible with reality ; of course , both films suffer when taken without a grain of sand . Valentino's characterizations are startlingly well-crafted ; no doubt , many original film goers missed the nuances present in the younger Ahmed , and would not have even guessed , unless alerted , Valentino was also portraying the older Sheik . The " split screen " appearance of the two Valentinos is technically brilliant ; and , even with make-up , Valentino's portrayal of the older Sheik shows an extraordinary range . In fact , Valentino could have essayed a double career as a dashing older man . Had he lived , Valentino might have been awarded his own best acting " Medal of Honor " for his performance , which was at least equal to John Barrymore's 1925 win , for " Beau Brummell " .
452510	15896852	19585	10.0	Lillian Gish in the Wind	Lillian Gish ( as Letty ) takes a train to Texas , where she will live with cousin Edward Earle ( as Beverly ) and his wife Dorothy Cumming ( Cora ) . Along the way , she flirts with Montagu Love ( as Roddy ) , whom she will meet again ; but , chief among the lovely Letty's male admirers is handsome Lars Hanson ( as Lige ) . Victor Sjöström's " The Wind " is a masterpiece of silent film ( and of film overall , for that matter ) . Ms . Gish delivers an intense , flawless performance of a lonely woman slowly being battered by the forces of nature . Gish is mesmerizing , but there are other amazing performances - witness Mr . Hanson's heart-breaking " unwrapping " of his new wife , Ms . Cumming's jealous wiping of her butcher knife , and Mr . Love's fore-shadowing of Gish's nightmare . " The Wind " is known to have had an ending added , by movie studio execs preferring a happier close . The ending may not have been the one preferred by Sjöström and Gish , but it is , nonetheless , satisfactory . Obviously , very little production time had passed , because the performers and sets change little ( if at all ) . The ending relationship you'll see does not differ wildly from the flow of the characters relationship ( or , you can trace how they wind up ) . What may suffer is the question , and level , of inner insanity suffered by Gish's character ( Gish versus the Wind ) . Still , it's a suitable ending .

453658	15896852	83922	10.0	Ingmar Bergman's Alexander ( and the Bishop )	This may be one of the most visually beautiful films ever produced ; the supreme " last " achievement from writer / director Ingmar Bergman and his crew , led by photographer Sven Nykvist . In whatever version you choose , " Fanny och Alexander " is long ; but , the film is worth the time commitment . It is a masterpiece . " Fanny och Alexander " starts out being about nothing in particular ; an almost cluttered assortment of characters celebrate Christmas 1907 . While in evidence , " Fanny " ( Pernilla Allwin ) and " Alexander " ( Bertil Guve ) do not seem to be major characters . By the film's end , young Guve's " Alexander " has emerged as the film's leading player ; but , each of the other characterizations are memorable . Characters who started out superfluous become funny , scary , poignant , and / or haunting . Yet , everyone seems to belong in the film . There is a main plot , which creeps up on you . There is no way to describe the story without giving too much away ; so , let's just say : A Swedish widow ( Ewa Fröling ) , with two children , marries a Bishop from Hell ( Jan Malmsjö ) . While each performance is remarkable , in its own way , Gun Wållgren ( as the Grandmother Ekdahl ) must be mentioned alongside those above . The sequences with Gurv and the antique shop residents , crosscut with the Malmsjö's Bishop and his Castle entourage , are especially magical .

452457	15896852	32904	10.0	Philadelphia Freedom for Katharine Hepburn with George Cukor	" The Philadelphia Story " is one of the best of its era - the period of time lasting from ( roughly ) the end of the " silent " era to the beginning of World War II . It's also the perfect Katharine Hepburn vehicle , and certified her position as one of the greatest actresses of her generation . The entire cast and crew are simply spectacular , with Ms . Hepburn and director George Cukor likely most responsible ( and deserving of " Best Actress " and " Best Director " attention ) . If you want to see one of Hollywood's most finely tuned old classics , this one goes to the top of the class . Exquisite .

453675	15896852	9150	10.0	All This and World War Won	Two American families , the Hamiltons and the Stephensons , have immigrated to a tranquil French village . As the film begins , Robert Harron ( as " the Boy " Douglas Hamilton ) and Lillian Gish ( as " the Girl " Marie Stephenson ) return home from separate trips . Lillian is obviously infatuated with Mr . Harron , and sets out to win his heart . Meanwhile , singer Dorothy Gish ( as " The Little Disturber " ) arrives in town ; and she , with " perseverance and perfume " , also sets her sights on handsome Harron . While Dorothy's efforts at seduction are valiant , Harron proposes to Lillian . As they plan their wedding , their lives are interrupted by a bigger " disturber " - - The Great War ( now called World War I ) ? This film , another huge hit for the director , was " commissioned " by the British government ( note the introduction ) , and must have secured the blessings of both the U . S . and French governments . The purpose was to create a pro-war , propaganda epic . Although the film is patriotic , and the war is never exactly shown as unnecessary ; it leaves an unmistakable impression as an ANTI-war film . So , what started as " A Love Story of the Great War " becomes " A Love Story Interrupted by a Great War " . Griffith reveals his true anti-war sentiments with the statement , " After all , does war ever settle any question ? The South was ruined - - thousands of lives were sacrificed - - by the Civil War ; yet , did it really settle the Black and White problem in this country ? " ( This question also offers , arguably , some redemption for Griffith's tendency for racial insensitivity . It's too bad Griffith's " The Greatest Thing in Life " is currently unavailable ; in it , Harron shocked audiences by kissing a dying Black soldier . ) In hindsight , it's easy to dismiss " Hearts of the World " as a Griffith production line effort . While it's derivative in film techniques ( Griffith's own ) ; it still equals , and sometimes bests , earlier work - - for example , witness the improved upon ( from " The Birth of a Nation " ) climatic ending , with Gish frantically trying to escape George Siegmann ( as Von Strohm ) ' s clutches . This , and the battle sequences are , at least , up to the standards set by Griffith ; so , it may be unfair to think of " Hearts of the World " as relatively minor . It would likely have won a " Best Picture " of the year , had they been given . Robert Harron would have won an additional " Best Actor " award ; and , while Lillian Gish might have lost to Mary Pickford's " Stella Maris " , sister Dorothy Gish would have earned a " Best Supporting Actress " award . Also watch for ? G . W . Bitzer's amazing camera work . The explicit , but appropriate scene of a mother nursing her baby during wartime . Dorothy licking her lips over Harron , but settling for " Cuckoo " Robert Anderson . Griffith's parallel symbolism , right down to Gish's goslings and Harron's little brothers . Lillian wandering into madness , and spending her wedding night with her beloved's " corpse " . Griffith " regulars " Siegmann , and " mothers " Kate Bruce and Josephine Crowell , who always stand out in lesser roles . Harron very quietly falling in love with the infatuated Lillian , while being pursued by seductive Dorothy ; demonstrating the difference between lust ( when he kisses Dorothy back ) and love ( when he eyes Lillian's figure ) . There are members of the Harron and Gish families in the cast ( and a Walthall ) , which would be nice to have somebody identify ( they are probably somewhere in the opening ) . Noel Coward may be difficult to recognize ; he follows Gish , early on , with a wheelbarrow . Erich von Stroheim is very easy to spot , clicking his Hun heels for the camera . Incredibly , scene-stealing littlest brother Ben Alexander grew up to serve ( memorably , as Franz ) in Lewis Milestone's " All Quiet on the Western Front " ( which owes some debt to this film ) ; later , he co-stared in " Dragnet " .
453277	15896852	32976	10.0	Alfred Hitchcock Puts Hollywood on Edge	What else can you say about Alfred Hitchcock's " Rebecca " ? It's still a startling production . Most obviously , it's one of the most perfect " Gothic " dramas produced ; making a very steady transformation from Daphne du Maurier novel to film , it gives the genre refreshing celluloid life . Mr . Hitchcock directs star Joan Fontaine ( as Mrs . De Winter ) to the top of her profession ; her guilty , frightened performance is a model for the reluctant Gothic heroine . Mysterious Laurence Olivier ( as Maxim De Winter ) and the supporting cast are perfect ; with sinister Judith Anderson ( as Mrs . Danvers ) raising her character to striking icon status . Ms . Anderson's excessive fondness for " Rebecca " , and the understated perverseness of sexuality between Mr . Olivier and both Mrs . De Winters , gives the film a edginess not permitted at the time . And , it was all enhanced by Hitchcock's expressive direction of George Barnes ' camera . Haunting .

The gruesome granddaddy of all films living dead , the original " Night of the Living Dead " still devours its successors . With this one , George A . Romero produced the horror equivalent of " Citizen Kane " . His black and white photography , and direction , is outstanding . And , Mr . Romero's excesses are in check ; every indulgence seen on screen gratifyingly fits the mood of the film . Karl Hardman , John Russo , and Russ Streiner are certainly most valuable players . The " non-acting " approach of heroic Duane Jones ( as Ben ) and the cast is effective , and refreshing . Influential and inspirational , the film's " anti-Hollywood " and / or " low budget " flaws have been rendered irrelevant . A startling masterpiece of light , shadow , and will .

That's our next-door-neighbor Jim , and that's his lover Jim ? " That opening narration is a terrific invitation to " American Beauty " , a dead-on depiction of sexual fantasies and foibles in suburbia . Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes construct an amazingly intuitive and artful picture . The cinematography ( Conrad L . Hall ) and music ( Thomas Newman ) are perfect . The entire cast is marvelous . Kevin Spacey plays his " Lester " to perfection - the moment when he decides NOT to indulge in a fantasy is just as uplifting as it would have been otherwise ; it is salvation .

452567	15896852	62622	10.0	" Open the Pod Bay doors , HAL . . . "	Since so much will be written about this film , I will be brief . I have seen " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " all the way through , twice . There are some parts I've watched separately , but I saw none of the film until AFTER 2001 . So , obviously , I think it has a timeless quality . I consider Stanley Kubrick's work on this film to be art , which really doesn't " age " . I believe there is also a point where " flaws " become irrelevant , and " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " reaches that point . It's probably been said ( I will look at the other comments this evening ) , but the portrayals of Keir Dullea ( as Dave ) and Douglas Rain ( as Hal ) are absolutely SPELLBINDING . I do consider Mr . Rain's portrayal of " HAL " an acting performance ; consider , also , how much Mr . Dullea accomplishes without speaking . The Dullea / Rain struggle is probably my favorite part of the film , presently . This one is indispensable . 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) Stanley Kubrick - Keir Dullea , Douglas Rain , Gary Lockwood , William Sylvester
453276	15896852	20030	10.0	Ho-LA ! ( Douglas Fairbanks ' Greatest Adventure )	Musketeer par excellence Douglas Fairbanks ( as D'Artagnan ) is back , in this extraordinary sequel to his " The Three Musketeers " ( 1921 ) . After some years , Mr . Fairbanks ' main job becomes protecting the French King's good son . Unbeknownst to most everyone ( except the movie audience ) , the Prince and heir to the throne , William Bakewell ( as Prince Louis XIV ) , has an evil twin brother ; the identical twosome were separated-at-birth , in order to assure one King ascended to the throne , without incident . However , " good " Prince Bakewell is abducted , and locked up in " The Iron Mask " ; then , " bad " Prince Bakewell takes his place . Fairbanks and his musketeer pals must set things right . With its superb acting , brilliant pace , and stunning photography , this is the one Douglas Fairbanks film you must see , if you only see one . " The Iron Mask " is among the best films in the swashbuckler and silent film genres . It's also ( probably ) Fairbanks ' best performance as an actor . His quintessential performance , and film , might have been overlooked for " Academy Award " consideration due to Fairbanks being , at the time , President of the Academy . It was also apparent , to Fairbanks and others , that the popularity of talking pictures would soon silence the older style , despite the artful late 1920s silent film productions . " The Iron Mask " featured a spoken word introduction ( with Fairbanks in fine voice ) ; currently , it is the rarer version . As the Fairbanks ' introductory words invite viewers into the " shadows of the past " , of a different " age " , it's worth seeking out the original introduction . Another version featured Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ' s narration , replacing intertitles ; this version is interesting , to a point . Note , eventually , the " narration " version becomes distracting and obvious . Fairbanks , with director Allan Dwan and photographer Henry Sharp , came up with an ending so memorable it's been said to symbolize the approaching end of its star's career , and the end of silent films in general . They could hardly have had a more suitable ending . For Douglas Fairbanks and company , " The Iron Mask " was a perfect fit .

Since the shop has none of Taylor's desired lovebirds , wealthy Hedren orders some up . Then , she decides to personally deliver them to Taylor's out-of-the-way home , on an island in Bodega Bay . After secretly delivering the lovebirds , Hedren is attacked by a seagull . The freakish incident causes Hedren to stay in Bodega Bay ; there , she becomes acquainted with locals , like schoolteacher Suzanne Pleshette ( as Annie Hayworth ) and Taylor's mother Jessica Tandy ( as Lydia Brenner ) . Inexplicable terror , laced with sexual desire - - " The Birds " is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's best . Worth noting : The lovebirds get excited , but never attack . Hedren makes a sensational starring debut . Brenner daughter " Cathy " looks like Angela Cartwright for a very good reason , she's Angela's sister Veronica . The Daphne Du Maurier short story " The Birds " ( 1952 ) only slightly resembles Hitchcock's film adaptation . An even earlier " Battle of the Birds " occurred in the Fawcett comic " Captain Marvel Jr . # 90 " ( October 1950 ) .

But press agent Sidney Falco ( Tony Curtis ) is oblivious to the whirlwind of street vendors , call girls and con men bustling around him as he nervously waits for the early edition of ' The Globe ' . Whose career did gossip columnist J . J . Hunsecker ( Burt Lancaster ) launch today ? and whose did he destroy ? " " A powerful film about a ruthless journalist and an unscrupulous press agent who'll do anything to achieve success , this fascinating , compelling story " should have been nominated for : " Best Picture " James Hill , " Best Actor in a Leading Role " Tony Curtis , " Best Actor in a Supporting Role " Burt Lancaster , " Best Director " Alexander Mackendrick , " Best Writing " Ernest Lehman & Clifford Odets , " Best Cinematography " James Wong Howe , and " Best Music ( Scoring ) " Elmer Bernstein . The film was too vicious to have been nominated for anything , however . Herein , sleazy Curtis finds his career threatened when he fails to stop his jazz musician cousin , Martin Milner ( as Steve Dallas ) , from engaging megalomaniacal Lancaster's nineteen-year-old kid sister , Susan Harrison ( as Susan Hunsecker ) . " Sweet Smell of Success " captures the perceived sleaze of the " Great White Way " columnist ( " read ?

452758	15896852	8443	10.0	Burning the Candle at Both Ends	Wealthy ten-year-old Mary Pickford ( as Gwen ) lives in a beautiful mansion ; she has everything she needs , except love . She must make an appointment to see her father ( Charles Wellesley ) , who spends his time wheeling and dealing ; and , she barely gets an opportunity to see her mother ( Madlaine Traverse ) , who is busily attending to social duties . Her parents do not have time to spend with lonely Ms . Pickford ; and , she is left in the care of unloving servants . A lot of studio trickery helps to make Pickford believable as the fun-loving , independent and lonely little Gwendolyn ; her age is not at all vague , as her 11th birthday is celebrated during the running time . You'll notice the large sets , and tall actors ( standing on telephone books , no doubt ) right away . Yet , finally , it's Pickford who pulls off the ruse . When she sits down for her tutoring , in close-up , Pickford makes the character a fully believable individual . The effort to make Pickford appear small adds to the film's surreal whimsicality . Importantly , " The Poor Little Rich Girl " is the first of Pickford's adult portrayals of little girls . Her relative youth , and lack of " affected " mannerisms , is an early strength ; she is fresh , and convincing . Later on , Pickford's portrayals suffered , as she employed stock muggings , pouts , and grimaces ( to be fair , these were responsive to moviegoers increasing demand she remain in the " little girl " roles ) . Subsequently , the Pickford mannerisms were more cloyingly adopted by Shirley Temple , and others ; for example , note how closely Pickford resembles Ms . Temple after she dons a boy's hat and clothes . Director Maurice Tourneur and set designer Ben Carré help create the extraordinary , whimsical world " Gwen " inhabits . There are some " special effect " sequences , ending with a drug-induced delirium . Therein , Pickford dreams about the day's people and events ; and , finally , she meets the beckoning figure of death , who invites : " Here , in the forest , dark and deep , I offer you , eternal sleep ? " Maxine Elliott Hicks and Herbert Prior are among the more notable supporting players . Frequent Pickford writer Frances Marion does a fantastic job bringing story details together ; she , Pickford , Mr . Tourneur , and Mr . Carré certainly created a monster .

453554	15896852	6864	10.0	A Most Extraordinary Film For the Ages	State-of-the-Art motion picture from director D . W . Griffith and company . This film requires a great deal of commitment , and concentration , in viewing . A good summation can be found in the words of " The Book " , which turns the pages on the historical eras depicted . Fleeting , and difficult to read during the film's running , the good folks at KINO include " The Book " in a special feature : " The book of this play is arranged in four parallel plot threads or lines of action , telling four stories with four sets of characters and dealing with four periods of history , all bearing on the one theme of intolerance . Intolerance is that thing in all of our nations which causes us to condemn all those who believe differently from ourselves . It has been the same in all ages , as far back as history goes . Intolerance as been the cause of more bloodshed than all other influences combined . How true it is that intolerance ever cloaks itself in the garb of righteousness that it may the more easily impose on the minds of men . " THE MODERN STORY ( 1916 ) : This is the main , and the finest , of the four stories . It begins with a group of women ( ironically called " Uplifters " ) promoting their " reformist " movement . " When women cease to attract men they often turn to Reform as a second choice " ; they embody the " garb of righteousness " being imposed , through the ages , on society . They become involved with the Jenkins family , millers , who run the town . THE JUDAEAN STORY ( Christ ) : This is the shortest of the four time slips ; it's the story of the betrayal and crucifixion of Jesus Christ . Griffith is wise to use Christ sparingly , as a compliment to his other stories ; to do more would have severely undermined this film , which needed to focus on the paralleled " crucifixion " ( hanging ) , in the " Modern Story " . THE FRENCH STORY ( 1572 ) : This Renaissance-era " hotbed of intolerance " Catholic / Protestant story further links Christianity ( or , depending on your beliefs , a misrepresentation of Christianity ) to the " Modern Story " of intolerance , social injustice , and self-righteousness . THE BABYLONIAN STORY ( 539 BC ) : This is the most visually stunning of the stories ; it links themes in the other stories ; and , importantly , it visually confirms " intolerance " as present throughout " ages " of history . Without " The Babylon Story " , the film would have left a much different impression , regarding religion and intolerance . Of the thousands of performers , the hero and heroine of " The Modern Story " must stand out , and they do : Robert Harron ( as The Boy ) and Mae Marsh ( as The Dear One ) are the stars of " The Modern Story " , and , so , they are the film's focus . Mr . Harron's performance is a masterpiece of screen acting . Ms . Marsh is perhaps too exuberant in some scenes , but equals Harron more often than not . The two , and their relationship , are the heart of the film ; their final reunion scene is heart-wrenching , and beautifully played ; amongst the thousands of extras , and millions of dollars , it's a film peak . Of the other " Modern " players , Miriam Cooper ( as The Friendless One ) stands out as a rival for Harron's affection ; instead , she finds herself fated to be the mistress of his gang boss Walter Long ( as The Musketeer of the Slums ) . Also noteworthy is Constance Talmadge ( as The Mountain Girl ) in " The Babylonian Story " ; like Marsh , she is sometimes too exuberant , which looks especially out of place during the battle scenes ; still , she makes an undeniable star-making impression . Elmer Clifton ( as The Rhapsode ) is noteworthy as her admirer ; enjoy the scene where he tries to get Ms . Talmadge to sit beside him ! Tully Marshall ( as The High Priest of Bel ) is always nice to see . Howard Gaye is a believable Christ in " The Judean Story " , and Margery Wilson ( as Brown Eyes ) is the focus of " The French Story " . There are numerous other performers , images , and moments ; the production levels are so high , Lillian Gish is employed to simply rock a cradle , between major time changes - - of course , she performs the task expertly !

453436	15896852	12532	10.0	Don't Start The Revolution without D . W . Griffith	Before and during the French Revolution , " Orphans of the Storm " Lillian and Dorothy Gish ( as Henriette and Louise Girard ) " suffer through tyranny and selfishness . " During the Plague , the sisters lose their parents , and Dorothy goes blind ; but , Lillian vows to care for her sister forever , declaring , " I'll see for you . " And , she does , for awhile . . . When the sisters learn the city may hold a cure for Dorothy's blindness ; they journey to Paris . There , Lillian is accosted by lusty aristocrat Morgan Wallace ( as Marquis de Praille ) , but she rejects his advances . Mr . Wallace decides he must have Lillian , and arranges to have her abducted for an upcoming orgy ; this leaves the blind Dorothy helpless , on the streets of Paris . She is rescued by street beggar Frank Puglia ( as Pierre Frochard ) ; unfortunately , his mother Lucille La Verne is a cruel hag , who abuses Dorothy . Joseph Schildkraut ( as Chevalier de Vaudrey ) falls for , and rescues Lillian , but finding her blind sister during the French Revolution proves to be quite le problème . D . W . Griffith and company are triumphant in this ( yet another ) breathtakingly beautiful film ; the direction , photography , sets , and editing , and performances are superb . Lillian and Dorothy Gish are flawless as the " Orphans of the Storm " ( this was the last Griffith / Gish cinematic team-up ) . The children who play the Gish sisters look and act amazingly like their adult counterparts . Mr . Schildkraut is quaint , yet charming , as Lillian's leading man ; he is a romantic ideal , kissing her tears and stroking her face ; after the revolution , he becomes quite strong . Dorothy's relationship with poor Puglia is an unexpected pleasure ; Puglia is given , and gives , a surprisingly vivid characterization ; as his mother , Ms . La Verne is deliciously wretched - - you can almost see her tonsils as she cackles ! The " Frochard " family ( La Verne , Puglia and Sheldon Lewis ) help give the film a Charles Dickens touch . Monte Blue is thunderous as revolutionary Danton , and Creighton Hale quirky as Picard . One of the characters gets it in the end . Orphans of the Storm ( 1921 ) D . W . Griffith - Lillian Gish , Dorothy Gish , Joseph Schildkraut , Frank Puglia
453516	15896852	31971	10.0	Ford puts John Wayne on a Stagecoach to the Stars	Director John Ford creates magic with some stereotypical passengers on a " Stagecoach " : Thomas Mitchell ( as drunken Doc ) , Claire Trevor ( as prostitute Dallas ) , John Carradine ( as gambler Hatfield ) , Donald Meek ( as timid Peacock ) , Louise Platt ( as pregnant Lucy ) , and Berton Churchill ( as banker Gatewood ) . Steering the coach is Andy Devine ( as comic Buck ) , and riding shotgun is George Bancroft ( as lawman Curly Wilcox ) . Ford makes an already great film a cinematic masterpiece by having the coach pick up John Wayne ( as " The Ringo Kid " ) . Note how the camera treats the arrival of Mr . Wayne - - it is literally a re-introduction to the actor , who was then approaching his 100th film . Possibly , Ford's increasing close-up of Wayne was only meant to highlight the legendary " Ringo Kid " character , but it certainly achieved much more - Wayne is stunningly approached , and Ford's camera clearly loves him . " Stagecoach " is extraordinary . It's difficult to isolate individual elements as being " better " that others , but the traveling coach scenes are beautifully done , from both the inside and outside of the coach . Wayne's introduction , and boarding , are highlights , of course . The off-coach stop-over , with Wayne and Ms . Trevor conversing in the nighttime outdoors , is equally beautiful . Writer Dudley Nichols ' scenario is great , and the characterizations universally appealing . " Stagecoach " is an absolutely essential viewing trip .

452810	15896852	18183	10.0	Mary Pickford Is " My Best Girl "	Mary Pickford ( as Maggie Johnson ) is a lowly " 5 & 10 cent " stockroom worker . One day , while covering a salesclerk's station , she encounters cute Charles " Buddy " Rogers ( as Joe " Grant " Merrill ) . Ms . Pickford thinks Mr . Rogers is a customer ; so , she tries to sell him on a Devil Doll - blowing it up for size ! The two are mutually attracted ; and , Rogers is happily assigned to be Pickford's stockroom ward . Pickford doesn't know it , but Rogers is actually millionaire store owner Hobart Bosworth ( as Robert E . Merrill ) ' s son , posing as a " commoner " in order to earn some business sense . Moreover , Rogers is engaged to marry his societal equal , Avonne Taylor ( as Millicent Rogers ) ? This was Pickford's final silent film ; and , in hindsight , she might have been wise to end her career right here , on top . " My Best Girl " is an indispensable film , one of several late 1920s films which show the silent film had achieved a considerable level of artistic sense . It's difficult to point out single pieces , since the entire film works so well ; however , the rainy location scenes are notably exquisite . Director Sam Taylor and Pickford shine throughout . Dave Kesson , Charles Rosher , and Jack Schulze make outstanding contributions . This is one of Pickford's finest performances ; and , she forms an extraordinary partnership with relative newcomer Rogers . Their scenes together are magical , rivaling the more rustic Lillian Gish / Robert " Bobby " Harron romances directed by D . W . Griffith . Pickford and Rogers later took the chemistry evident on film to heart , and formed a more long-term partnership ; their wedding and " newsreel " footage provide a lovely coda for " My Best Girl " . . . Life imitates art . My Best Girl ( / 27 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , Lucien Littlefield , Hobart Bosworth
452703	15896852	18451	10.0	Ramon Novarro definitively answers , " Is it Good to Be King ? "	Ramon Novarro ( as Karl Heinrich ) is the Crown Prince of Karlsburg . He is envied by his subjects , but lonely and isolated behind castle walls . Quite Princely in appearance , and capable of performing royal duties , he is , nonetheless , not enamored with dutiful royalties . With help from tutor Jean Hersholt ( as Dr . Juttner ) , he becomes an honor student , and is goes to university at Old Heidelberg . There , he meets and falls in love with commoner Norma Shearer ( as Kathi ) . " The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg " is a first rate silent film production , expertly directed by Ernst Lubitsch . Mr . Novarro is appropriately exuberant as the young Prince - his performance is excellent throughout , but really starts to dazzle in the scenes beginning with his witnessing of Ms . Shearer's downing a German beer . Mr . Hersholt is great as Novarro's tutor ; both men are superior with the necessary " silent screen " acting , and the more forward " underplaying " . Ms . Shearer is just a step behind her co-stars in artful acting ; but , it's a a gap she will very quickly fill . Shearer is terrific in the scene when she learns Novarro is leaving , and helps him pack . Philipe de Lacy is notable , playing the Prince as a boy ; his characterization matches the older Novarro - director Lubitsch directs these early sequences effectively , creating the image of a young prince in his castle prison . When a couple of important people in the Prince's life die , the story becomes necessarily more somber in tone . Of course , Novarro must eventually become King - these scenes are beautifully symbolic , and extraordinarily well photographed . The visit by an old friend prompts Novarro's return to Old Heidelberg , with unexpected results . Don't miss a later scene , when Novarro returns to his Old Heidelberg bedroom - especially , watch how Novarro briefly strokes his bed , obviously thinking of Shearer ; it's a superb little bit of sexual suggestion . It would be nice to know whether the gesture originated with Novarro or Lubitsch - but , it's probably not possible to determine . " Is it Good to be King ? " You'll know when you see Novarro's beautifully acted final scene , in his royal carriage - certainly , it's one of the most memorable performances in silent cinema .

452369	15896852	36241	10.0	Nursing the Outlaw	Jane Russell nurses Jack Buetel back to health - but , that's not all . Seriously , I rate this film extraordinarily high . I've watched the film three times . The first time , I resisted . I watched with amazement ? this movie has an incredible " look " . I suppose it's a film made in the ' 40s , seen mostly in the ' 50s , looking very much like an early ' 30s " talkie " - but , ACTED IN SLOW MOTION ! I wanted to dislike the film , but I really could not . I loved the saloon - reading the visible graffiti on the walls , never knowing who was going to shoot who , when , and why . . . When Mr . Buetel and Ms . Russell tumble in the hay , I recognized the scene from a dozen subsequent westerns ; yet , it seemed suspenseful the way director Hughes ( ? ) shot it here . I could not really state there is a rape ( others may ) ; and , I think , later scenes imply there was no rape . I believe the scene simply ended with her shirt torn . There certainly is a lot of ambiguity ! I agree there are some lines between the male actors which could be taken sexually . I caught those upon viewing the film during a second sitting . Early on , Mr . Huston wonders if Mr . Buetel might want to bunk with him if he doesn't " have a girl " . BUT , Huston has Russell already lined up . There is also the age old question of whether the western hero needs his horse , or his girl , more . Of course , the western hero picks his horse ! I believe these ambiguities add to the enjoyment of the film . They are additional things to think about during repeated viewing . During my second viewing , I just enjoyed the movie more ? it's just so unusually interesting . With all " classic " films , I think about different meanings , and things going on ? this movie has the ability to grow stronger thematically with repeated viewings . That's something I look for when rating a movie highly . A movie can take on a life of its own . I love the performances ? Mr . Mitchell and Huston are older , more experienced actors while Buetel and Russell are younger . They all work well together . I especially enjoy " Billy " and " Rio " as she nurses him to health . The most recent viewing ( today ) had me wondering about how the peculiar " look " of this film was achieved . It's very claustrophobic , but has some " location " stuff . I watched those scenes more carefully . I watched Mr . Buetel's guns during his " exchange " near the end . I noticed Ms . Russell's attire became more alluring with each scene . I noticed the tombstone closing : " HERE LIES ? " The tombstone is a " LIE " . Could this play on words have been intended ? This is a film I would call " chance art . " I have no idea what effect the filmmakers were looking for - - was it just intended as a showcase for Jane Russell's attributes ? That was achieved . All the rest is icing . I submit that " The Outlaw " creates a unique and entertaining " world " of its own . The four main performers are riveting . I think " The Outlaw " is a world worth repeated revisiting . Next , I need to keep my eyes on Billy the Kid's ears , and see when the blood drops appear on his shirt . The Outlaw ( 1943 ) Howard Hughes - Jack Buetel , Jane Russell , Walter Huston , Thomas Mitchell
452787	15896852	9796	10.0	The Slow Acid of Discontent ( Do You Hear Voices ? )	Raymond Hatton is " John Tremble - 2nd Assistant Cashier of the Clumley Contracting Company . " He hears voices from the Hall of Echoes . Kathlyn Williams is " Jane Tremble - his wife . " Eventually , she will hear voices of her own . Elliott Dexter is " ' Fighting ' George Coggeswell - A far-seeing young legislator who heads a commission with extraordinary powers to investigate the muddy waters of the state's politics . " He tilts the scale of justice with pipe ashes . Mr . Hatton is stuck in a $25 a week dead end job , with no hope for the future ; living with his mother ( Edythe Chapman ) he is unable to even buy a cheap little dress for Ms . Williams , for Christmas . To make ends meet , Mr . Hatton embezzles $10 . 000 from his company . Plagued by guilt ( and an investigation ) , Hatton drops out of sight , for a couple of days . Whilst fishing , he reels in a dead man , and decides to exchange identity with the deceased Edgar Smith . He becomes Smith , and very unwisely ( as it turns out ) frames him for both the Tremble embezzlement , and the murder of Tremble - so that he may achieve martyrdom . Then , he becomes a fugitive ? This is an epic psychological drama ; always interesting , it slowly becomes more and more unnerving , even horrific . The crescendo of images and plot build wildly , to an INTENSE ending . The film sometimes appears to be off-track , but winds up a tightly woven nightmare . There are SO MANY images to praise - but , just watch . . . Also , look for the cross-cutting as Hatton fishes for a dead body while Dexter fishes for Tremble - then , later , Tremble hooks up with a Chinatown prostitute while his wife marries Dexter . Director Cecil B . DeMille and the production team are in peak condition . Hatton , remembered mainly as a " supporting " or " character " actor , performs supremely in the lead role ; he effectively portrays the " slow acid of discontent steadily consuming " the soul of John Tremble . Williams shows some psychological problems of her own . Noah Berry has an important role as a longshoreman who guiltily houses Hatton , after unintentionally crippling him . It's difficult to believe this film was released in 1918 , and has received relatively little acclaim . It's a NOT TO BE MISSED silent classic . The Whispering Chorus ( 1918 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Raymond Hatton , Kathlyn Williams , Elliott Dexter , Noah Berry
453318	15896852	18578	10.0	Shooting Stars	In a small town , youthful dreams play out . Working on his car , all-American boy Charles " Buddy " Rogers ( as Jack Powell ) daydreams he is a pilot . Girl-next-door Clara Bow ( as Mary Preston ) dreams about Mr . Rogers , but he wants handsome best friend Richard Arlen ( as David Armstrong ) ' s girl . Mr . Arlen has it all : looks , money , and beautiful city girl Jobyna Ralston ( as Sylvia Lewis ) . Then the " mighty maelstrom of destruction " known as WAR draws them into the center of its power . The introduction of the central triad of characters is amazing : Rogers on the ground , Bow behind bloomers , and Arlen in the swing - - note how Rogers comes between his friend and the beautiful city girl , as they lazily swing ; his energy , in the car , and on foot , crashing in on them . Rogers thinks he desires Arlen's girl , but you'll " know " differently . These marvelous characters will eventually fulfill your dreams for them ; as the film so artfully portrays a myriad of youthful relationships . You can read whatever you want into their love ; and , it's all true . William A . Wellman's direction is superb . Assisted by photographer Harry Perry , Mr . Wellman is on par with early Orson Welles , and mid-period Griffith or Hitchcock . Much has deservedly been written the unsurpassed aviation sequences ; and , these are indeed breathtaking ; in the context of this film , they can never be equaled . Moreover , Wellman is as extraordinary in the film's opening ten minutes , showing the characters " in flight " before they ever leave the ground . With the silent film genre and aviation theme , Wellman's directorial achievement is textbook . Charles " Buddy " Rogers seems to be channeling Robert " Bobby " Harron ; which , under the circumstances , couldn't be more appropriate ; his " Wings " , Clara Bow and Richard Arlen , are as beautifully portrayed . Bow was the film's " superstar " draw at the time of release ; yet , temptation to turn the film into a " star vehicle " is wisely dispensed with ; and , she is seen to great advantage . Future star Gary Cooper ( as White ) and past star Henry B . Walthall ( as Mr . Armstrong ) have small , important roles ; the fact that Mr . Walthall's character appears disabled is one of the film's many great subtleties . The lesser known supporting players ( and great crew ) should all be proud . " To those young warriors of the sky , whose wings are folded about them forever , this picture is reverently dedicated . " What " Wings " says about war should be obvious : ultimately , you kill what you love . Wings ( 1927 ) William A . Wellman - Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , Clara Bow , Richard Arlen , Henry B .

452895	15896852	38057	10.0	Mona Lisa Without the Smile	Lowly cashier Edward G . Robinson ( as Christopher " Chris " Cross ) receives the nominal company gift of an engraved watch , for 25 years of faithful service . Slightly tipsy , Mr . Robinson leaves to look for the New York City subway . On a Greenwich Village street , he sees beautiful Joan Bennett ( as Katherine " Kitty " March ) being slapped around , and thrown to the ground , by boyfriend Dan Duryea ( as Johnny Prince ) . Robinson rescues Ms . Bennett , and Mr . Duryea flees . Unhappily married , Robinson is enthralled with shapely , sexy Bennett , and succumbs to her request for a drink . Bennett suspects the older , unattractive Robinson is a wealthy artist ; she decides to use his obvious interest to her advantage . Director Fritz Lang's brilliant , daring , and imaginative follow-up to " The Woman in the Window " ; " Scarlet Street " is one of its genre's crowning achievements . Bennett's nasty , spitting " Kitty " is a sleazy , amoral classic ; if the part weren't so unflattering , she could have won a " Best Actress " award . Somewhat less underrated , Robinson masterfully manages his mild-mannered role ; certainly , he deserved " Best Actor " consideration . Always convincing in " tough " roles , Robinson is especially believable as the apron-clad " Chris Cross " . Bennett and Robinson formed a striking screen partnership , under Lang's direction . Their characterizations are beautifully summed up when Bennett , likely a lazy prostitute , orders aspiring painter Robinson to paint her toenails . At home , Robinson is forced to paint his pictures in the bathroom ; he sees beauty in a flower on the sink ; and , you'll see the clear outline of his toilet bowl , in the lower right of your screen . Dudley Nichols ' screenplay ( of the original " La Chienne " ) cleverly plays within , and stretches the limits of , mainstream motion picture standards . Duryea , Margaret Lindsay ( as Millie ) , and shrewish Rosalind Ivan ( as Adele ) are the best supporting players . See " Scarlet Street " once for the story , and twice for the art . Scarlet Street ( 1945 ) Fritz Lang - Edward G . Robinson , Joan Bennett , Dan Duryea , Rosalind Ivan
453435	15896852	9968	10.0	The Twain Shall Meet	Richard Barthelmess ( as Cheng Huan ) is a gentle Chinese man ( " The Yellow Man " ) , immersed in the teachings of Buddha ; he is thinking of leaving China as a missionary . After witnessing a brawl among visiting westerners ( " Jackies " ) , Mr . Barthelmess is convinced that Anglo-Saxons need the gentle lessons of Buddha ; so , he immigrates to Limehouse , a poor London district . There , Lillian Gish ( as Lucy ) lives with her " Daddy " - - abusive boxer Donald Crisp ( as Battling Burrows ) . Ms . Gish is treated like a slave in the Burrows hovel ; she is regularly whipped by hard-drinking Mr . Crisp . Barthelmess finds London uninterested in Buddhism ; disillusioned , he opens a modest souvenir shop . Barthelmess and Gish meet , and fall in love ? Subtitled " The Yellow Man and the Girl " , D . W . Griffith's " Broken Blossoms " is poetically directed and photographed ( G . W . Bitzer ) . The opening scenes are lovely , simple scenes of Chinese people carrying on with their lives . Buddhist Barthelmess is the main " Yellow Man " ; and , though he is Caucasian , he fits in well . Griffith has some fighting " Anglo-Saxons " disrupt the peaceful scenes , this foreshadows later developments and illustrates the main theme and relationship - - the Eastern / Western culture clash represented by Barthelmess and Gish . Of course , the meeting of the two is doomed . Barthelmess ' performance as an Asian has a sensitivity not present in subsequent attempts by big name " Anglo " actors to play " Oriental " parts ; with a lot of integrity , he plays shopkeeper Cheng Huan as an idealist Buddhist becoming a disillusioned pipe-smoker ( probably of Opium ) . Watch for Barthelmess ' reaction when a Christian missionary announces he is leaving for China to convert their heathen ; it's a classic revelation of maturity and understanding . His expertly played love for Gish shows up in his eyes as love , not lust ; this is the more difficult , but correct , way to play the part . Gish is likewise magnificent , creating one of her most memorable characterizations ; her motion of using two fingers to force upon her face a " smile " is classic ; her eyes reveal the horror behind her tear-aged face . Gish is great , sadly walking the Limehouse streets , collecting tin foil , and admiring unaffordable flowers and dolls . At home , she finds it increasingly impossible to avoid Crisp's abuse . Crisp is sometimes too grimaced ; but , it works in later scenes . Note , in an early scene , when Gish encounters two prostitutes , that the prostitute to the left of your screen is making a " date " ! The good folks at KINO include Gish's introduction to " Broken Blossoms " ; she is a delightful storyteller ; among other things , she reveals boxer Norman Selby was " The Real McCoy " . An amazing , never to be equaled , film . Broken Blossoms ( / 19 ) D . W . Griffith - Richard Barthelmess , Lillian Gish , Donald Crisp , Edward Peil
